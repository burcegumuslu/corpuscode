They fought poverty, disease and inequity together as a team with their Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s fun work that we we\u2019ve dedicated ourselves to.\n\nBut late today, the stunning news the couple who had been married 27 years announcing in identical posts on Twitter, after a great deal of thought and work on our relationship. We\u2019ve made the decision to end our marriage, that to say they will continue their work together at the foundation. But quote, We no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives. Bill Gates announced last year he would focus on philanthropy stepping down from Microsoft\u2019s board. Two years ago, Melinda Gates wrote a book about gender equality. The hardest pieces for me to write were the most private\n\nparts of the book, moments in our marriage where I was asking bill for more equality\n\nand back in January on today, she joked about how she and Bill were splitting cooking chores during the pandemic, what people could set the table and\n\nboth people can do that microwaving in the cleaning up and so we\u2019re trying to again continue to role model that in our house for our children\n\nwith three children now in their teens and early 20s. The gates asked for space and privacy for their family as we begin to navigate this new life\n\nmy excited to talk to you guys I already saw the news. Bill and Melinda Gates are getting divorced. Yes the timing of this is incredibly suspect. We\u2019re gonna get to the bottom of why this is happening. I\u2019m just kidding. We won\u2019t we\u2019re going to talk about some dickhead conspiracies about why this could have happened. I\u2019m going to end and I\u2019ll give you my hot take on what could which conspiracy could have the most traction to explain what happened here we\u2019re gonna go through this because surely you already know who Bill Gates is you know Melinda Gates is yes. On on May Fourth, no less on the nerd holiday. They announced publicly they were getting divorced. The jet Hanks he called it he said it\u2019s gonna be a hot boys summer. Well, no hot white boy summers that was white boys summer that was what he said. there and it\u2019s gonna be a white boy. Summer for Billy. About a lap down for the world\u2019s richest man. Except No, not quite. It\u2019s gonna be a hot girl summer for Melinda. Because they did not have a prenup. We\u2019re gonna talk about all these things right up all these things we\u2019re gonna talk about, I don\u2019t know some of these elites. We\u2019re gonna talk about some of the conspiracies about Bill Gates. Why is he always on the conspiracy radar? We\u2019ve covered them pretty in depth in the past. So I\u2019m I rehash over a couple of ideas that you may already be familiar with. We\u2019re about the microchips in the Jambi. stubbies. Oh, boy. Yeah, this is uh, this is hot news. So this is kind of a last minute exclusive. It\u2019s gonna be kind of short. Because I couldn\u2019t because all the hot hot conspiracies haven\u2019t dropped yet. People are still trying to make sense of things. I\u2019ve got one and I\u2019m throwing my two cents into the ring here. And I\u2019ll fittingly put it at the end. I like to entertain like to keep you in suspense the whole show. And I\u2019m gonna wait till the end. To tell you what I think. But yeah, it looks like it\u2019s gonna be a hot girl summer from London. She\u2019s gonna be you\u2019re gonna wait call surges. Oh, baby. No prenup. But instead, they\u2019ve got what they call a separation contract, which was a privately agreed upon document. And they\u2019re gonna file it in the court. Which, by the way, you got to wait for that April 4 2022. That goes down. So we got another year to find out more details. But this, they\u2019re already saying this could be the largest divorce settlement ever. And if you recall, the other alpha nerd Jeff Bezos, his wife, he got a 38 billion with a B. And she became the third richest woman in the world instantly. And people were always played. Oh, She didn\u2019t do anything. She didn\u2019t deserve $38 billion. Well, guess what, Jeff Bezos didn\u2019t really do anything, either. I know, I know. He gave us Amazon and I love Amazon. Because I love the way they treat their employees from what I hear on the news could be wrong. Maybe the employees love it. I don\u2019t know. No clue. All I know. And this is coming from a very pessimistic, snarky place. I would argue that Jeff basis probably didn\u2019t do much either. Because you can\u2019t really work your way up to them much money. Takes a little bit of luck, a little bit of connections. Some of these people come from wealth, some of them sell their soul. I mean, some folks work their way up. But I would guess the large majority 95% of them are just Ron as jerks that slice a million throats on the way up. And he probably deserves he\u2019s bright deck. Probably, what do I know? Maybe he\u2019s great. I know that he lets me publish my books through his website. And I love that I know that I shop on the website all the time. He definitely changed the book game, that\u2019s for sure. So you know, hats off to that. Ironically, he, his Amazon did not let me publish one book. There was only one book that would they wouldn\u2019t let me punish. And it was the Oh, not only want to say the term, it\u2019s the stabby jabby conspiracy, that I\u2019ve renamed a couple of times. Now. It\u2019s the stabby jabby controversy, which you can still get on my gumroad store for free, since they wouldn\u2019t let me publish it. gumroad.com slash Isaac W. And it\u2019s gonna come up later in this analysis. So yeah, if you haven\u2019t got it yet, go get it. I\u2019ll put the link in the show notes. You can get it for free. It\u2019s, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s gonna prompt you to put $1 amount in. I\u2019m assuring you you can put zero in there and just get it for free. Read it. Because back last year, I thought, Oh, dear, we have to do a deep dive on these stabby jobbies. Because that\u2019s the next move. Right? Clearly, that\u2019s the next move after all these studies and all these event tool ones and the UN roadmap like this is their thing. They love them. And I was always kind of lukewarm about him. I was like, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not my thing. I don\u2019t take the flu shot. I\u2019ll do none of that crap. Like I take a tetanus shot. That\u2019s a stabby jabby No, you know, and I\u2019ve had a million of them growing up and I was in the military, they pumped 1000 of these things in me. So like, again, this is always the hot debate in the truth or world is taking the coat the call the virus because you know what I\u2019m talking about the virus, the new one stabby jabby. Like, I don\u2019t care, no matter me, like, Is it safe? Probably not. Is it effective? Maybe? do I care? No. You got to make that call. Some people got issues that they\u2019ve got concerns about the virus that I do believe was cooked up in a lab and I do believe the virus is? It\u2019s not, it\u2019s a different one. Right? I think it\u2019s different. But we don\u2019t want to go down that sidetrack. I\u2019m just telling you, you can read my analysis on there for free. Because after looking at it, I thought, well, these things really aren\u2019t as safe as they want you to believe. And I think that\u2019s what all the anti folks see. And I wanted to sort of, you know, throw my support their way like yeah, you know, I agree with you guys. Like I\u2019m not hell bent on it. Like I\u2019m not a medical expert. I don\u2019t I mean, who knows how the human body works. I don\u2019t think these these doctors and nerds even know the answer to that. Anyhow, let\u2019s not get into that too deep right now. That\u2019s a such a such a tangential rabbit hole. Where we\u2019re talking about Jeff Bezos look like Lex Luthor with a bald head. His wife was a third richest overnight. Well, Melinda is about to have a hot girl summer B. I don\u2019t know first number one, I guess. And Bill, old ball gates. They\u2019re the gates of ball. He hired a law firm. And guess which one he hired is Warren Buffett\u2019s right hand man Charles Munger for Munger, tolles. And Olson and Munger himself is going to be one of the lawyers. Guess old old Charles Munger is? He\u2019s 97 my god. 97 still being a lawyer. You\u2019re telling me they\u2019re not drinking adrenochrome out there. Speaking of adrenochrome we\u2019re going to talk about briefly I mean barely. Bill Gates connection to Marina Abramovich Kind of building an overarching sort of support for my idea of why if there\u2019s a conspiracy related to this F and that\u2019s a big if I\u2019m Mr. Boring rational over here I\u2019ve got an argument for what it could be if we if it goes to the conspiracy route which I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll publicly spill the beans like that. I\u2019m gonna guess Melinda had to take a little bit of a vow of silence on all of this right and it says that this is there\u2019s so much money involved that if they split the monies halfway here we\u2019ll go from the fourth richest man to number 17 Oh, that\u2019s gotta sting 17 By the way, the number for cue trick I\u2019m triggering up all the QA non votes take a listen. Maybe this is symbolic of them taking them down. Now run with that cue folks run with it. screaming from the top of the mountains and share this podcast with all your cue. rabid fan base. Now the Bloomberg they dropped the this is the top 10 richest folks in which appears to all be men. Say and this is as of May 4 2021. Jeff Bezos is number one. Ilan musk number two nerd both of them nerds. Bernard arnauld. no glue that is probably a nerd probably in the Illuminati. When you have that much money and you don\u2019t know who that person is. illuminate confirm. Says he\u2019s French. Maybe he\u2019s famous in France. I don\u2019t know. Number four. Bill Gates nerd. Number five Mark Zuckerberg nerd and alien and robot. Number six Larry Page nerd. Number seven Warren Buffett. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a nerd. He\u2019s just a financial guy. Sure. He\u2019s a nerd, sir. Hey, Brian, nerd. And the list goes on and on. Some other notables on the list, the Koch brothers, the Koch family, which is where all your conservative psyops come from. Because I log I always got to point it out. Like I don\u2019t I think both parties are untrustworthy. But for some reason, the truth is never want to point out that the conservatives are sketchy. Well, the Koch family that\u2019s the Illuminati money that pays for all the conservative psyops. The Walton families on there, there\u2019s your Walmart, your Walmart psyops. Now Walmart they do drugs employees I grab, I\u2019ve confirmed that talking to one of them. That tell the story. I\u2019m gonna tell you the quick story. I was in there. I went to the automotive department. I don\u2019t remember what I bought. This is many, many years ago. I had to sign I think the receipt or something. The lady hands me the pen. She was make sure I get that pen back. I went to mine. And I signed I said, Walmart doesn\u2019t have pens. She said no. They made me bring my own. And I can\u2019t lose as my last one. I\u2019m like damn, they don\u2019t pay much. You can tell they\u2019re certainly as attitudes. And then they don\u2019t even give them pens. Ain\u2019t that about a bitch? jack Ma. We talked about jack ma Chinese billionaire. We talked about him about a year ago after Kobe Bryant died with my I did like three or four shows on Kobe Bryant is a massive event and then here comes the virus and boom. Smile later Coby virus time. JACK Ma, if you recall in how he connects to Coby. He had invested in a thing called VIP kids in China and fund 88. He\u2019s the guy who founded Alibaba, which is like your sweatshop plug. You know, because in America here it\u2019s like everyone wants to be an entrepreneur so they immediately try to support sweatshops and child labor abuse. Well, Alibaba is a place where you can buy stuff full of sweatshop goods. And I had confirmed on the show where I did dug into this whole thing that he invested in VIP kids in 2018, which is connecting them to Coby then 2019 Coby signed as a brand ambassador for fun 88 because Kobe was huge in China. They were pimping his ass out and all kinds of stuff in China and fun and he was like this online, sports betting casino kind of thing. So he was definitely on the radar for jack Ma. Okay. Because there\u2019s arguments there\u2019s conspiracies that Colby was taken on by the Chinese. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of weird things going on. is definitely too much for my my little brain to handle between The virus, no one really kind of talking about where it came from. I mean, ironically, on 60 minutes and CNN a couple weeks ago, on the same day, they both had specials about the virus. And they both floated the, the idea that it came from the lab in Wuhan, and they threw some pretty good arguments for it. And I thought I knew it. I knew this came from the lab. And they basically said it right on TV. And then another really came with it. I thought, well, that\u2019s kind of bizarre. Very on that list. Tons of Chinese billionaires, tons of Russian billionaires. But, you know, nerds rounding out the top 10 though easily, easily, including your boy, ball gates. Now why let\u2019s Okay, now why did they get divorced, let\u2019s look at the official message they sent out to the public. I\u2019m gonna redo I\u2019m going to redo word for word of their boring little message. Nothing fun in there to be found. But it\u2019s definitely worth taking a look at. He says they both tweeted the same thing. And then Melinda puts a power flex move at the end. I\u2019ll tell you about it hang on. After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we\u2019ve made the decision to end our marriage. Over the last 27 years we\u2019ve raised three incredible children have built a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives. We continue to share belief in that mission. And we\u2019ll continue our work together at that foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives. We ask for space and privacy for our family know as we begin to navigate this new life love melinda gates and Bill Gates Oh my god. Even Bill Gates tweeted that he put his he put his lady\u2019s name before his power moved by Melinda. She\u2019s running the show. She\u2019s been Dr. Evil the whole time. We thought it was Bill and Melinda on Bill Gates, his Instagram. I don\u2019t know if you were ever on there where you every single post he had every single post he had almost every single comment was completely negative telling him to go kill himself. It was classic, it was humorous. If you like that troll sort of entertainment. Like a real jerk. Like I am. It was comedy to read through the comments. And I thought oh, this one\u2019s gonna be good. So I went over there and turned them off. really turned them off. turned off the comments. sad day on Instagram. Now let\u2019s get into these conspiracies. First off, Bill Gates is probably a robot. There\u2019s that he\u2019s definitely a nerd. He\u2019s definitely gonna kill us all. He\u2019s because he\u2019s the most dangerous kind of nerd. He\u2019s the extrovert alpha nerd. The most dangerous nerd there is. He can read 150 pages a minute with a 90% retention rate. Oh my God, he\u2019s Johnny fire from short circuit. Before he had proposed to Melinda, he actually wrote out on a whiteboard. The pros and cons of marrying her. There\u2019s something wrong with a guy okay. Like I\u2019m not saying anything wrong with making a pros and cons list to marry somebody like you need to do that. Don\u2019t write it on a whiteboard and shallower dude. You wonder why this didn\u2019t work out. He infamously said technology could fix everything literally. Everything. No. What do you call it? No hyperbole. He means it can fix everything. And so it will. That\u2019s why he\u2019s obsessed with eradicating diseases. technical problems can be solved with technical strategies and technical products and technology to these folks. And I\u2019m not saying technology is not great it is it enables a lot of things. But you got to be careful. It\u2019s not the end all be all. He\u2019s the guy who Bill Gates he made those CRISPR mosquitoes remember the CRISPR technology the gene editing stuff for the the immune human hybrid clones or whatever. We made a bunch of fake mosquitoes with CRISPR for the target malaria kill campaign, basically eugenics program for the mosquitoes. And it should be pointed out that at that Wu Han lab, they also did CRISPR gene splicing.\n\nWhat do you think of that?\n\nBecause my whole thing this whole time has been, man, we\u2019re in a bad way. Everyone freaked out right at the beginning and shut everything down. I think is because there\u2019s a true story that we\u2019re not being told of some really dangerous, crazy stuff that could be the outcome of all this was while I say like, Hey, your medical decision is your decision because I don\u2019t know what the right answer is here. I mean, you\u2019re you\u2019re looking down the barrel of a CRISPR gene editing, mutating crazy weirdo, bio weapon virus maybe. Or the same thing by way of jabby stabby. Well, choose your own adventure, I say. And I am going to cover spars by the way there\u2019s a lot of spars talk in the conspiracy community. I\u2019m digging in on the research. I\u2019m hoping to have that out soon. So standby for that. states they liked and subscribed. Okay. Oh, and if you don\u2019t, if you haven\u2019t been on the Illuminati, watcher.com website, go there. Sign up for that email newsletter for books, five bucks. Case closed. That includes the the stabby jabby controversy book. What do these nerd got? They think that technology is the master given to them from Lucifer, if you want to take it to a spiritual route, and then they can be the nerd Gods by tweaking the entire global population, according to the knowledge bestowed to them, because they know best. A lot of these elitists they\u2019ve been talking about this, Jonas Salk talked about it. And we\u2019re going to cover a little bit of this. I talked about this already in my stabby jabby controversy book. But Jay Dyer covered it on Infowars on the spars talk. And we\u2019ll cover that on my spar show. If you haven\u2019t seen all that. And here\u2019s the juicy part. Here\u2019s the part that I think is well how should we do this? All right, yeah, we\u2019ll do that. Okay. I want to say the juicy the part that I think is the is the real deal till the end, okay. Now, we\u2019re talking about odo dupa, dupa, dupa, dupa. Okay. People think that Bill Gates is the architect of the virus. Because it\u2019s true. He\u2019s been obsessed with this for many, many years, this whole idea of viruses and how to how to run pandemic scenarios and how to get the jabby stabbings rolled out. And now they\u2019re going to save everyone. And you know, he\u2019s been wanting to eradicate polio, and malaria and all these things, like he\u2019s definitely interested in these things, right. So naturally, people think, well, he made this whole thing happen. Maybe, or maybe he just said, I mean, it\u2019s like he kind of predicted the future in some ways where, for 20 3040 years, people have been saying, we\u2019re waiting for the next big pandemic. I mean, went how far down the rabbit hole you want to go, some people think germs and viruses aren\u2019t real? I certainly don\u2019t know. But I do know that his father is on the board of Planned Parenthood, which, which was alleged to be part of a Rockefeller eugenics program. Again, not throwing judgment either way, I\u2019m just telling you what the conspiracy group thinks. Because some people like Planned Parenthood, because you know, what plant in defense of Planned Parenthood, this gives women a right to, well, you know, what do you want to call their reproductive rights? They want to get on the pill, and they\u2019re in a position where they can afford to boom, here we go. But other people that goes bears would be like, Oh, my god, they\u2019re there. They\u2019re promoting abortions and this eugenics program to keep, you know, poor inner city people from reproducing and I don\u2019t know. I mean, there\u2019s some weird ties to Rockefellers and eugenics that cannot be denied but you know what? no judgment assigned is all I\u2019m trying to say from from from your boy Isaac. But the foundation, the bill and gates Melinda Foundation, this is sound a little bit like Donald Trump. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is all about the public health. They\u2019re about public health, education and climate change. And they\u2019ve been involved with this virus since the beginning. They they gave almost 2 billion with a B. do research for the jabby stabby for the virus, because they\u2019ve got like 43 billion in their in their bank account. And the foundation they\u2019re making the foundation like one of the richest people in the world, right? like Bill Gates, I don\u2019t have it in my notes here. I want to say he\u2019s he\u2019s only worth like 150 billion himself. Which is why they say like Gates is a major donor to the World Health Organization who\u2019s always behind this whole thing because they, yeah, look like I don\u2019t trust those suckers either. Man. They\u2019ve been covering up for the Chinese his whole time. Can\u2019t trust those people. And the foundation is fifth on the list of donors. There. It was last year when I was researching this. When you look at the World Health Organization, they survive off donations. And the Bill Gates Melinda foundation is fifth on the list. GAVI is seventh, that\u2019s another one of these like Bill Gates, jabby stabby groups, which takes us into the microchip theory. On TV, Linda said, that bill never had plans to put a microchip in the stabby, which, ironically, just on Sunday, john oliver on HBO, played this clip. The day before all this was announced the day before went down,\n\nthrow up their hands and say, I just don\u2019t know enough to get the shot. They have already seriously fucked things up for all of us. And to be clear, most people who are hesitant are not fanatics, or conspiracy theorists, many are just trying to make the best decision for themselves and their family like that pediatrician that we saw earlier. You definitely know people like that in your life. So I\u2019m actually going to spend the rest of this piece trying to clear up some of the biggest myths flying around and some are pretty easy to debunk quickly, like the claims that Bill Gates is using the vaccine to put a microchip in all of us something his wife had this response to,\n\nI know my husband is not vaccinating people and putting a microchip in our arm because that technology doesn\u2019t even exist, and he\u2019s never uttered the words out of his mouth. So\n\nokay, thought wasn\u2019t the reassuring pushback to a batshit conspiracy theory that I had hoped for. To be honest. We\u2019re not microchipping people because the technology doesn\u2019t exist yet. And my husband hasn\u2019t said it out loud to me. Why would you put it like that? They\u2019re the\n\nthe queue folks, they think that Melinda is not even real, right? They think she\u2019s fake. She\u2019s an actor. And Bill\u2019s about to get arrested. That\u2019s what this is all cover up for bill to get arrested. He says give me some private time. The truth is that he wants private time so that he can go to jail. Some folks think that Melinda is going to turn his ass in for crimes against humanity because of all this through because she just found out the truth about the microchip apparently, is what they claim. As she wants to save herself, she\u2019s like, Look, I\u2019m a millionaire, I would not look good in orange. Some say Bill Gates is already dead. This is a cover up. I don\u2019t believe that one at all homes stupid. Some think that bill Melinda couldn\u2019t come to an agreement on what they\u2019ll do now that they\u2019re able to track the global population with the microchips. Now that everyone\u2019s got the microchips, and they can track their movements? How can they best control the world? And they couldn\u2019t come to agreement? on that. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be in the settlement agreement. Like, I\u2019ll control US and China and you control Russia and India? I don\u2019t know. Again, hard to believe some of these ideas. And just to clarify about the microchips, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s quite factual. Is it impossible? No, but like, that\u2019s not really the truth. There\u2019s kind of got they lost their way with that one, because, and we covered this last year. What happened was that there was you know, Bill Gates funds a ton of research projects through MIT and all these things. Well, he was looking to come up with a way to prove like he was like, if you look at, like some of these poor countries, these third world countries, okay, so they give them the jammy stabby and then want to give them a piece of paper and say, here, keep this or why they got a computer system there. All of a sudden, they want to like type in Okay, you know, so and so got the stabby jabby. No, they can\u2019t. So he said, Well, how can we make it so that we can Tell the jammies Debbie\u2019s in there. And they research quantum ink dots. So that used an app on your phone. And you would go over the spot where they got the stabby jabby. And it would leave behind a basically a little tattoo, an invisible tattoo. Which, of course, I mean, that\u2019s like your mark of the beast talk, right? And somehow this this, because there was also ideas about a microchip but like the thing Bill Gates had funded was that the quantum ink dots and it got to you know, one thing led to another. Now it\u2019s a microchip, but like, Look, what Okay, smart asses. What about your cell phone? You don\u2019t think it\u2019s tracking you? I was talking about something the other day I got ads on my phone for it. I was like, Cool. Thanks. Appreciate that. The tracking is too late right? Now Now we\u2019re gonna get into the part that I think is the most if there\u2019s a conspiracy behind all this, this is the most likely and by the way, most interesting conspiracy. And again, I talked about this in the stabby jab controversy book, link in the show notes. Get it for FREE $0 or you go to Illuminati watch comm sign up for you\u2019ll see the link at the top for books for five bucks. And it has links and it\u2019s on there too many ways to get this thing. But Billy was friends with Jeffrey Yes, that Jeffrey, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill once said and I quote, his lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing, although it would not work for me. Why wouldn\u2019t it work for you bill? Because Melinda is gonna cock block you. When I\u2019m Linda\u2019s out of the picture. Maybe that lifestyle will work for him now. And of course he was like, No, I\u2019m talking about his artwork. Yeah, I collected art and stuff. Oh, really? document. Okay. Bill flew on the Lolita express the one that shuttled miners between New York and Palm Beach. He donated money to MIT through Epstein, because, you know, Epstein was tied into these MIT nerds and he was also interested in transhumanism. They had a lot in common needs to and in speaking of nerds with transhuman fantasies, Ilan Musk, you know, that knurling cap. These guys all think they\u2019re gonna make things happen. Epstein\u2019s last legal activity before he, quote unquote, killed himself by wrapping toilet paper around his neck and jumping off the two foot bunk and breaking his neck or whatever, that the cameras just happen to not be working. The guards just happened to be asleep. His last legal activity he did before that happened, he amended his will and added a backup executor named Mr. Nico Luke. Who\u2019s Mr. Nico Luke, you may ask? Well, this is a guy who runs a venture capital firm with none other than Bill Gates. He is also the science advisor for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So Melinda knows who Mr. Niko leak is. Maybe some secrets got leaked to Melinda and she was like, Oh, hell no bill. What you\u2019re doing over there bill. And if you\u2019re thinking well, Isaac, like what what allegations are there? Well, I\u2019m gonna tell you. There are claims that he was real friendly with the former Miss Sweden. Dr. Eva Anderson Dubin. Not only Miss former Miss Sweden, but her 15 year old daughter at the time. He met he hung out with Epstein and the Miss Sweden entered 15 year old daughter and wrote to a colleague the next day he wrote, quote, a very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by and I ended up staying there quite late. Now that Miss Sweden she married this billionaire hedge fund manager named Glenn Dubin. This was after Epstein paid her way through medical school. Why did he pay her way through medical school? Was he just a real nice guy has ever seen a real nice guy Yes or no? and her husband Glenn Dubin. Now, since Epstein killed himself is alleged to be part of this ring of improprieties against the children. I\u2019m gonna read you from Wikipedia, because it sums it up pretty good. In August 2019 unsealed documents reveal connections between Dubin and Jeffrey Epstein. Including allegations of involvement in his sexual abuse ring. Former house manager for the Durbin\u2019s Rinaldo Rizal is not a you guys remember the jerky boys? was not a character on the jerky boys that the tapes were they were prank call people. Anyway Ronaldo results describe a 2005 encounter at the demons home with a 15 year old girl employed as a nanny. Rizzo said the girl who was shaking and crying, told him that she was pressured by Gilliam Maxwell to have sex with Epstein, with Maxwell taking her passport when she refused a month into her employ. According to the Daily Beast, the Durbin\u2019s took the girl with them to Sweden, where she was dropped off in an airport. The unsealed court documents were from a lawsuit filed in 2015 against Maxwell by Virginia Roberts Jaffray, who named several individuals as participants in Epstein sex trafficking scheme that included Glenn Dubin as one of the men with which Epstein and Maxwell forced her to have sex in September 2020, that\u2019s not that long ago, the Attorney General of the British Virgin Virgin Islands subpoena the Durbin\u2019s as part of their probe into the dealings of Jeffrey Epstein. Now, is that 15 year old girl the same 15 year old girl that Bill Gates has, I don\u2019t know, because the timelines don\u2019t match up. But you\u2019ve got these connections of Dubin and Sweden and Epstein and Bill Gates. Now, what\u2019s the dirty dark secret? I don\u2019t know clearly, I don\u2019t know. was built doing this stuff. I have no clue. If there\u2019s smoke, is there fire maybe. You know, like, in conclusion, what\u2019s the most likely scenario if this goes the route of conspiracy theory? And that, to me is like the most factually based idea for conspiracy here is that Bill Gates has these connections to Epstein. And maybe Melinda found out a bill is messing around with these sweetest girls. I don\u2019t know. Are we ever gonna find out? Probably not. I mean, Bill\u2019s been on my radar because of his transhuman fantasies. If you recall, he was hooked up with Marina Abramovich. They did this thing called the life. There\u2019s this transhuman thing. And again, just like how he disabled the comments on his Instagram, they took down the video from the YouTube, this ad promoting it. I want to read you from the the Life Project says for Abramovic technology presents an opportunity to immortalize her spirit, something she has been trying to achieve through her work, quote, the fact that the project can be repeated anywhere in the world, while I am not there is mind blowing, I can be present in any spot on the planet. Because they were going to project her her likeness, sort of like a hologram, I guess, through this VR thing. And that\u2019s the ultimate plan is the uploading of digital consciousness. And the problem is, here\u2019s the problem. that technology is advancing so fast, the computational speed is advancing so fast. Normal folks like us have no idea what\u2019s coming. But these elites with all the time and the money in the world do and they\u2019re trying to sort of play chess to set themselves up to be the new gods. And along the way, maybe maybe Bill\u2019s messing around with the same. I mean, he was friends with Epstein, right. He was on Lolita Express, and these are all the mainstream media sources telling you this stuff. I\u2019m not making any of that up. And maybe Melinda found something out. Maybe. Now, if you want to check out I\u2019ve been talking about the jabby stabby controversy book. You can find a link in the show notes you can get it on gumroad comm backslash, W, go ahead and pick up some sign paperbacks. While you\u2019re there, I wrote a lot of books.
