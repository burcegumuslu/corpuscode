The game, which is open to the public, will be in place until Monday, November 1.\n\nThe 4.5-meter-tall doll is guarded by two men dressed in pink suits and wearing masks on, as seen in the show. When it turns its head, it chants \u201cred light, green light.\u201d Once it looks back, anyone who moves gets eliminated, or in this case, asked to leave the game.\n\nConsidering the COVID-19 guidelines in the country, the residents who want to join the game must check in with a QR code and provide proof of vaccination.\n\nThe players are encouraged to wear pink and green tracksuits, just like the iconic characters from the show.\n\nIf you still haven\u2019t seen Squid Game, it\u2019s a Netflix show about 456 people competing for a massive cash prize. Throughout the 9 episodes, they play a total of six children\u2019s games. Anyone who breaks the rules or simply loses in the games gets eliminated.\n\nRed Light Green Light is the first game the characters play, where they get to actually understand the deadly aspect of the tournament.\n\nLess than a month after its release, Squid Game became Netflix\u2019s most-watched show, with over 111 million fans.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Squid Game?
