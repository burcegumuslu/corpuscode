(Source.)\n\nUsing the exact same search for all FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years before the COVID-19 shots were issued emergency use authorizations, I found 220 cases resulting in 16 deaths over 360 months. (Source.)\n\nThat\u2019s an average of .6 cases per month for the previous 30 years compared to an average of 46 cases of cancer per month following COVID-19 vaccines, an increase of 7,567%.\n\nThe CDC and FDA have not issued any warnings regarding increased cancer rates following COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBreast cancer was the most prevalent cancer reported following COVID-19 vaccinations, with a 8,900% increase over cases of breast cancer reported following all FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years. (COVID-19 vaccine breast cancer report here. Previous 30 years vaccine breast cancer report here.)\n\nThere are 77 reported cases of prostate cancer following COVID-19 vaccines including 12 deaths (source), while there are 18 reported cases of prostate cancer following all other FDA approved vaccines for the previous 30 years (source), which is an increase of 9,525%.\n\nThere are 68 reported cases of colon cancer following COVID-19 vaccines including 11 deaths (source), while there are 13 reported cases of colon cancer following all other FDA approved vaccines for the previous 30 years (source), which is an increase of 11,670%.\n\nLook for the pharmaceutical industry to profit off of this by developing new drugs to treat these COVID-19 vaccine-induced cancers, probably with more mRNA vaccines, as people foolishly continue to take these killer shots.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom. The news also serves as a social connection tool, as we tend to relate to those who know about and believe the things we do. With the power of an open truth-seeking mind in hand, the individual can grow wise and the collective can prosper.\n\nNot sure how to make sense of this? Want to learn how to discern like a pro?
