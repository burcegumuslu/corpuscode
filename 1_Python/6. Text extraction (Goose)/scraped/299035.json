The vaccination policy says workers \u201cwill not be permitted to work and may be subject to discipline\u201d if they weren\u2019t vaccinated by Dec. 31. The policy did allow for a religious exemption or an accommodation due to a medical condition or recent treatment for COVID-19.\n\nAt the end of last year, a \u201csignificant percentage\u201d of firefighters \u201cexpressed \u2026 personal, moral, religious and/or medical objections to receiving a vaccination,\u201d according to an affidavit from Mike Smith, Local 21 president. He and the police union estimated in November that 20 percent of their members weren\u2019t vaccinated. The fire department\u2019s authorized strength is 435.\n\nChris Wachtler, the attorney representing several unions who sued, said he was pleased with the ruling but emphasized it didn\u2019t reflect an anti-vaccine sentiment by the unions he represents, which include firefighters and supervisors, as well as a host of workers in city departments that range from public works to transportation.\n\n\u201cThe unions are not against vaccinations per se,\u201d Wachtler said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what this was about. This was about a narrow labor issue. \u2026 They (city leaders) weren\u2019t going to give a testing option from the very beginning. That\u2019s all we ever asked for.\u201d\n\nThe unions and the city held limited talks before the city put the mandate in place. Castro\u2019s ruling appears to essentially send the city and the unions back to the bargaining table, where Wachtler said he expects his unions to ask for an exception to the vaccine mandate that would allow workers to regularly get tested for COVID-19 instead.\n\u2022 Xcel Energy to buy 20 acres of land at The Heights for east metro operations, job training center\n\u2022 Letters: Taxation matters.

We remain committed to our efforts to have a fully vaccinated workforce.\u201d\n\nThe effectiveness of testing as a means to reduce workplace transmission right now is unclear, since coronavirus variants currently circulating are frequently not detected by widely used rapid tests, even after symptoms have begun. It\u2019s also true that vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time \u2014 although they still reduce the risk of infection, and especially of hospitalization and death.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Judge rules in favor of St. Paul unions over COVID vaccination mandate", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2022/06/02/ramsey-county-judge-rules-in-favor-of-st-paul-unions-over-covid-vaccination-mandate/", "description": "The employee unions called it an unfair labor practice \u2014 and the judge agreed.", "article:published_time": "2022-06-02T20:26:26+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-06-03T23:09:20+00:00", "site_name": "Twin Cities", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Virus_Outbreak-Vaccines-Whats_Next_57288.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "COVID", "Melvin Carter", "St. Paul"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.twincities.com/2021/12/01/st-paul-firefighters-union-serves-city-with-lawsuit-claiming-unfair-labor-practice-over-vaccine-mandate/", "https://www.twincities.com/2021/10/21/st-paul-mandating-covid-19-vaccinations-for-all-city-employees/", "https://www.twincities.com/news/politics/", "https://www.twincities.com/2023/04/24/thai-woman-sentenced-role-in-international-sex-trafficking-ring/", "https://www.twincities.com/news/politics/", "https://www.twincities.com/2023/04/24/minnesota-supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-appeal-of-ousted-otto-bremer-trust-trustee/", "https://www.twincities.com/news/politics/", "https://www.twincities.com/2023/04/24/xcel-energy-to-buy-20-acres-of-land-at-the-heights-for-east-metro-operations-job-training-center/", "https://www.twincities.com/news/politics/", "https://www.twincities.com/2023/04/23/letters-taxation-matters-which-states-are-growing-and-which-arent/", "https://www.twincities.com/news/politics/", "https://www.twincities.com/2023/04/23/new-tooth-fairy-candy-store-st-paul/", "https://www.twincities.com/2022/05/24/dont-take-a-rapid-covid-test-too-soon/", "https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/3-covid-vaccine-doses-appear-protect-against-omicron-subvariants"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-06-02T20:26:26+00:00"}
