What a time to be alive.\n\nFor those who missed it, two days ago the UK government declared a \u201cnational incident\u201d after traces of the polio virus were detected in sewage from North London.\n\nThis is a massive escalation, even compared to the pandemic. Covid and Monkeypox at least had the good taste to wait for a single person to actually have the disease (allegedly) before hitting the big red panic button.\n\nIn a somewhat startling coincidence, just two days before the \u201cpolio in London\u201d news broke, Forbes published an article headlined\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s totally unrelated, talking about a \u201cpolio-like\u201d enterovirus that hasn\u2019t yet had a vaccine approved in the US, and never mentions London once.\n\nThe same (or similar) news hitting headlines around the world for (supposedly) totally different reasons makes my inner-cynic twitch.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on here?\n\nWhile it may look like polio is suddenly back in the news, it\u2019s actually been there longer than you\u2019d think and has been building to this point.\n\nThe truth is it all fits into a very predictable pattern.\n\nIn November of 2020, a new \u201cgenetically engineered\u201d and \u201ctriple-locked\u201d polio vaccine was the first vaccine to be granted \u201cemergency use listing\u201d by the World Health Organization, despite there being only around five thousand cases of polio in the world over the last decade.\n\nIn October 2021, the government of Ukraine declared a \u201cbiological emergency\u201d due to the \u201cre-emergence\u201d of polio, which was blamed on low vaccine uptake.\n\nThis was steadily reported in back pages of the news for months. Culminating in headlines like \u201cPolio Makes a Comeback in Ukraine as War Halts Vaccination Campaign\u201d, following Russia beginning its \u201cspecial operation\u201d.\n\nLater, in March of this year, Israel reported they too had a \u201cre-emergence\u201d of polio after allegedly detecting \u201cvaccine-derived\u201d polio in the stool of a young girl suffering from paralysis.\n\nAt this point, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) started speaking out. GPEI is a project co-funded by the WHO, the US CDC, GAVI the vaccine alliance and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\u2026in other words, exactly who you\u2019d expect.\n\nFollowing the reported case in Israel, GPEI released a statement calling for \u201cenhanced surveillance\u201d\u2026\n\nA month later, in April of this year, using alleged \u201cre-emergence\u201d as a springboard, GPEI called for \u201crenewed efforts\u201d to combat polio, launching their new \u201cStrategy\u201d and claiming to need a further 4.8 billion dollars in funding.\n\nThen in late May, at the WHO\u2019s 75th World Health Assembly, \u201cglobal health leaders\u201d called for \u201curgent action to end polio once and for all before a unique window of opportunity closes for good.\u201d\n\nThe same week, the WHO\u2019s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the assembly regarding polio [emphasis added]:\n\n\u2026which brings us to June, and scare-stories on both sides of the Atlantic warning of \u201clow vaccination rates\u201d\n\nNote that the WHO report claims the virus entered the UK on someone who received a \u201clive vaccination\u201d overseas, and the alleged outbreak in Israel is \u201cvaccine-derived\u201d.\n\nDo you see how this works yet?\n\u2022 The WHO approves \u201cemergency use vaccine\u201d, bypassing need for trials and safety data\n\u2022 A handful of cases of polio are reported (as they are every year)\n\u2022 Gates/WHO funded thinktank calls for \u201cincreased surveillance\u201d, meaning more testing (using PCR tests)\n\u2022 Cases are blamed on the old vaccines\n\u2022 New \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201csafer\u201d vaccines are rolled out.\n\nIn October, at the World Health Summit in Germany, GPEI is launching a \u201cpledging moment\u201d to try and raise around 5 billion dollars to \u201cachieve a polio-free world\u201d.\n\nGiven the headlines, they should pass that mark pretty easily, wouldn\u2019t you think?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that market researchers found the polio vaccine market had \u201cstagnated\u201d through 2020 and 2021, due to the Covid19 \u201cpandemic\u201d.\n\nNo more stagnation now.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "\u201cPolio Outbreak\u201d \u2013 The WHO, Bill Gates, emergency vaccines & more of the same", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/06/24/polio-outbreak-the-who-bill-gates-emergency-vaccines-more-of-the-same/", "description": "Kit Knightly Audio Version New Feature!
