Forget \u201cproof.\u201d You know it. You saw it. You felt it. You experienced it. It happened. It\u2019s real.\n\nThe 2022 midterm was just stolen. Just like 2020.\n\nIf you disagree, you\u2019re either delusional, or terribly na\u00efve, or brain dead. Or you\u2019re in on the fix.\n\nIt\u2019s time to admit we\u2019re all part of a massive experiment in fraud, theft, brainwashing, and gaslighting to a degree never seen in world history.\n\nThink of all the times in just the past few years you\u2019ve been gaslighted. They lied to you about open borders\u2026they lied about Hillary\u2019s 30,000 deleted emails\u2026they lied about spying on Trump\u2026they lied about Russian Collusion\u2026they lied about a perfectly fine Ukrainian phone call\u2026they lied about massive Biden corruption in Ukraine and China\u2026 they lied about the Hunter Biden laptop they lied about the origins of Covid\u2026they lied about the need for lockdowns and masks\u2026they lied about the need for Covid vaccines\u2026they lied about the vaccines being \u201csafe and effective\u201d\u2026they lied and covered up all the deaths and injuries from the vaccine\u2026they lied about the success of miracle drugs Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin\u2026they lied about the stolen 2020 election\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ve been the victims of nonstop severe gaslighting for a decade now. You\u2019re all part of a human psychology experiment in the limits that government and media can go in propaganda and brainwashing\u2026while you can see they\u2019re lying right in front of your eyes.\n\nAnd these are the exact same people now telling you Democrats just over-performed, and stopped a GOP red landslide, against all odds, without cheating and stealing the midterm election.\n\nHistorically, every president in history facing his first midterm experiences a tough day with automatically 20 to 30 House seats lost\u2026and 4 or more Senate seats lost\u2026but this terribly unpopular President Biden is brain dead with severe dementia, and can\u2019t put 3 coherent sentences together\u2026Yet Biden defied history?\n\nWhile also facing the worst economy in modern history\u2026and the worst inflation in America\u2019s history\u2026and out of control crime\u2026and open borders\u2026and failing schools\u2026and polls showing 75% of Americans believe the country is going in the wrong direction\u2026Yet Biden beat all of that?\n\nIf you believe Democrats made a miracle happen, without cheating, rigging and stealing\u2026I have a bridge to sell you, over the Atlantic Ocean, in the Vegas desert.\n\nFirst, every poll in the country showed a gigantic GOP landslide victory- ranging from red wave, to red tsunami. Polls even showed women moved 32 points from September to October in favor of the GOP.\n\nBut in the end they all moved back to Biden and Democrats? Does that make sense to you?\n\nSecond, every poll in the country showed the top two issues, by a mile, were inflation and the economy. And crime was in second place, along with open borders.\n\nAnd they all voted for Biden and the Democrats? Does that make sense to you?\n\nCNN\u2019s own exit polls showed the GOP made massive gains among almost every voting group- men, women, white men, white women, blacks, Hispanics, young people. Everyone.\n\nAnd they all voted for Biden and the Democrats? Does that make sense to you?\n\nIn this environment where Americans can\u2019t afford gas\u2026or groceries\u2026or rent\u2026with the economy failing\u2026inflation raging\u2026scared to death of losing their jobs\u2026living in cities plagued by violent crime, mass shoplifting, homeless everywhere, streets lined with poop, pee, drug needles\u2026and failing schools intent on teaching your children to become masked transgenders\u2026\n\nIn this environment, they all voted for Biden and the Democrats? Does that make sense to you?\n\nThat they looked around at the disaster one man has created in only two years, and they defied a century of historic midterm defeats for the party in power\u2026and voted for Democrats? Folks, you\u2019ve been gaslighted.\n\nBut the real proof the midterm was rigged and stolen is\u2026FLORIDA.\n\nIn Florida the GOP won a landslide. DeSantis and Rubio and everyone else in the Florida GOP won in a red tsunami. The same one the polls showed was happening in the entire country.\n\nGuess what Florida has? Florida has strict Voter ID, strict laws against voter fraud, severe prison terms for anyone caught trying to commit voter fraud, no mail-in ballots sent to every voter, no ballot drop boxes, no ballot harvesting, no ballots accepted for days after Election Day, no counting for days until the desired result is achieved by the Democrat Party.\n\nIsn\u2019t it a funny and strange coincidence that in that state, with all of those strict rules against cheating, the GOP red tsunami happened as predicted? But everywhere else, where there are no strict laws against voter fraud, and they allow all that cheating, the red tsunami fizzled.\n\nAnd that under-performance is being blamed on Trump? And on conservative MAGA candidates?\n\nYet in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is the most Trump-like, MAGA, America First, anti-woke, anti-trannie, in-your-face, ultra conservative politician in all of America. And with that ultra MAGA message, plus strict voting fraud laws\u2026the GOP swept to a landslide victory.\n\nAnd in most other places, they didn\u2019t. Coincidence?\n\nFolks, we\u2019ve been robbed. Again. This was a repeat of 2020. They\u2019ve fixed, rigged and stolen the election. First, they robbed us of the Presidency. Now they\u2019ve robbed us of a red Republican landslide. And now they\u2019re trying to blame it on Trump.\n\nThis is gaslighting. And we\u2019ve had our election stolen- again.", "opengraph": {"title": "WAYNE ROOT: You\u2019ve been gaslighted \u2013 Democrats just stole another election", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2022-11-15-wayne-root-democrats-just-stole-another-election.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "When something is so obvious, if the outcome makes no sense, if the outcome is literally impossible, then it is what it is.
