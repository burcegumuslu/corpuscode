In the early 1990s, he was working as a senior lecturer at the Royal Free Medical School in north London. He had published a number of studies which he suggested showed a link between measles and Crohn\u2019s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. By the mid-1990s, Dr Wakefield had started to consider whether there was a link between the three-in-one MMR vaccine and autism and bowel disease. His study focused on tests carried out on 12 children who had been referred to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead for gastrointestinal problems. At the same time, Dr Wakefield was paid to carry out another study to find out if parents who claim their children were damaged by the MMR vaccine had a case. Some children were involved in both studies. He was to advise parents against having their children vaccinated with the 3 in 1 shot. His comments and the subsequent media furore led to a sharp drop in the number of children vaccinated against these diseases. In 2001, Dr Wakefield resigned from his \u00a350,000 a year NHS post, after 14 years in the job.\n\nSpeaking at the time, he said: \u201cI have been asked to go because my research results are unpopular.\u201d Dr Wakefield has since worked for the International Child Development Resource Center. The centre, based in Florida, is associated with the Good News Doctor Foundation, a Christian ministry. He has also continued to see patients at the Thoughtful House, a centre for autistic children in Texas, where he is currently the executive director.\n\nDr Wakefield remains adamant that the scientific results of his 1998 study are still valid.\n\nIn a statement, he said: \u201cThe clinical and pathological findings in these children stand as reported.\u201d He also welcomed the decision by the General Medical Council to examine how he carried out his research.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Natural Cures for Rubella - NaturalCures.com", "description": "Find all Natural Cures for Rubella only on NaturalCures.com - the world's #1 resource of natural health cures and remedies, including Rubella .
