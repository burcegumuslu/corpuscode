Kennedy Jr. Is a Real Profile in Courage for Our Era \u2013 American Free Press", "cleaned_text": "Of all the many children and grandchildren of President John F. Kennedy and his siblings, only one is saying the kind of things that caused JFK, his brother Robert, and son John Jr. to be silenced by the corrupt establishment. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has emerged over the past decade as a formidable, radical public figure.\n\nThe son of former Senator and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was killed while he was on the brink of winning the 1968 Democratic Party presidential nomination, first publicly expressed his doubts about the official version of both his father\u2019s and uncle\u2019s deaths in a 2013 interview with Charlie Rose. Incredibly, the show never aired, and no video of RFK Jr.\u2019s comments has ever appeared.\n\nRFK Jr. declared, \u201cMy father thought that the Warren Report was a shoddy piece of craftsman- ship.\u201d RFK Jr. would visit Sirhan Sirhan in prison in 2018, explaining, \u201cI went there because I was curious and disturbed by what I had seen in the evidence. I was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father. My father was the chief law enforcement officer in this country. I think it would have disturbed him if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that the evidence shows some- one other than Sirhan fired the fatal shots, RFK Jr., said, \u201cThe people that were closest to [Sirhan], the people that disarmed him, all said he never got near my father.\u201d\n\nRFK Jr. also wrote an article for Rolling Stone about fraud in the 2004 presidential election, which was lambasted by the left especially, even though he was arguing that Democrat John Kerry had been cheated out of the presidency. Salon magazine and a high-profile Democratic Party pollster were but two of the loud voices blasting Kennedy\u2019s contention. Another article Kennedy wrote for Rolling Stone proved to be even more controversial. RFK Jr.\u2019s 2005 piece \u201cDeadly Immunity\u201d argued that vaccines contributed to autism. The British Medical Journal called a study referenced in the article \u201coutright fraud,\u201d and Salon editor Joan Walsh urged that the story be removed. Rolling Stone predictably caved in to the pressure and RFK Jr.s\u2019 story was thrown down the memory hole. This was RFK Jr.s\u2019 first foray into battle against the Medical-Industrial Complex.\n\nLast year, RFK Jr. unleashed a series of blistering attacks on Bill Gates, the pharmaceutical industry, and the lockdown on social media, especially Instagram. In February 2021, RFK Jr.\u2019s Instagram account, which had over 800,000 followers, was permanently banned, \u201cfor repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.\u201d One article gleefully reporting the ban referred to him as \u201can infamous and prolific peddler of dangerous anti-vaccine and Covid-19 misinformation.\u201d The article bemoaned the fact that RFK Jr.\u2019s Facebook account remained active. Apparently, The New York Times was upset about this, as well, and grilled Facebook as to whether or not Kennedy\u2019s account would be banned or penalized in some way.\n\nRFK Jr. has helped establish two organizations, the Children\u2019s Health Defense and the World Mercury Project, both of which have been smeared for their \u201cmisinformation\u201d by the establishment. Kennedy has been as critical of Anthony Fauci as he has been of Bill Gates. Calling Fauci \u201can abject failure\u201d in March 2021, RFK Jr. hasn\u2019t backed down from the intense criticism, which includes his own close family members (who have talked about his \u201cdangerous\u201d views). Turning his attention to the Covid-19 vaccines, RFK Jr. declared earlier this month, \u201cEven though the media and politicians are currently trivializing the problem and even foolishly calling for a new type of vaccine to return to normality, this vaccination is problematic in terms of health, morality and ethics, but also in terms of genetic damage.\u201d RFK Jr. urged the public not to take the vaccine \u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d and called it a \u201ccrime against humanity that has never been committed in such a significant way in history.\u201d\n\nRFK Jr. has been smeared as a \u201csuperspreader\u201d of hoaxes. As one article described it, \u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was once an acclaimed environmentalist, but his anti-vaccination advocacy and conspiracy theories have made him a magnet for misinformation in the pandemic.\u201d Kennedy blasted the lockdown last year, in a speech before hundreds of thousands in Berlin, which was largely censored in this country. Democratic New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman recently called RFK Jr. \u201ca health menace,\u201d and urged Twitter to ban him.\n\nRFK Jr. reacted to being \u201ccanceled\u201d thusly: \u201cFacebook, the pharmaceutical industry and its captive regulators use the term \u2018vaccine misinformation\u2019 as a euphemism for any factual assertion that departs from official pronouncements about vaccine health and safety, whether true or not.\u201d\n\nHe decried the \u201ctotalitarian censorship\u201d and called it \u201ca coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the First Amendment, the foundation stone of American democracy.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://www.beatirs.com/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/qanon-an-invitation-to-the-great-awakening/", "https://www.amazon.com/Stretch-Texas-Ground-Jeff-Weber/dp/B07RP4C92H/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_2?crid=2JOQQC9ZKFRAT&keywords=my+stretch+of+texas+ground&qid=1558243028&s=gateway&sprefix=My+Stretch+of,aps,167&sr=8-2-fkmrnull", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/print-news-matters-1-year-print-subscription-u-s-only/", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
