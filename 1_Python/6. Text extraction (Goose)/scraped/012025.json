See the reference at the bottom of this post. \n\n\n\nFrom Children's Health Defense:\n\n\n\nIn 2019, a remarkable book, \u201cTurtles All The Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth,\u201d was published in Israel. The book, originally written in Hebrew, is a comprehensive examination of the evidence behind the assertion that vaccines are safe and effective.\n\nThough it might easily have been lost to obscurity, the book gained initial acclaim when the leading medical journal in Israel, Harefuah (\u201cMedicine\u201d), gave it a positive review.\n\nWriting in the September 2019 issue of Harefuah, two senior academic criminologists, Nati Ronel and Eti Elisha, \u201cfound the book to be well-written, serious, scientific and important\u201d offering \u201ca comprehensive view of the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurtles All The Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth\u201d became the first book critical of vaccines to have ever received a positive review from a mainstream medical journal.\n\nCriticism of Ronel and Elisha came quickly from the medical establishment, but as Mary Holland, editor of the book and Children\u2019s Health Defense president and general counsel states in the book\u2019s foreword:\n\n\u201cTheir appraisal of the book still stands today, unscathed: in the three years since its (Hebrew) publication, no medical or medical science professional has succeeded in refuting the book\u2019s claims.\u201d\n\nThe reason the information offered in the book has yet to be refuted is simple. The book\u2019s 1,200+ citations reference only mainstream scientific journals and health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization.\n\nAn attack on the book is ultimately an attack on the medical establishment itself.

After giving a lecture on astronomy, Russell was refuted by a woman in the audience, who claimed that the earth was situated not in space, but on the back of a large turtle. When Russell asked what the turtle was standing on, the woman replied that it was \u201cturtles all the way down.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Turtles All The Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth ", "site_name": "AGE OF AUTISM", "type": "blog", "url": "https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/08/turtles-all-the-way-down-vaccine-science-and-myth-.html", "description": "What does \"Turtles All The Way Down\" mean?
