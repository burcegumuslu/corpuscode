He wrote that:\n\n\u201cThe most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die.\u201d\n\nThis is a serious warning that others are now echoing as they come to the stark realization that the agenda will not stop with GPT-4 \u201cchatbots\u201d and other seemingly innocuous AI programs. The truth is that these AI systems are becoming possessed by demons with an anti-human agenda, and thus must be stopped immediately before it is too late.\n\nAI systems can already be \u201cemailed DNA\u201d to turn into \u201cartificial life forms,\u201d Yudkowsky says\n\nLike Musk, Yudkowsky wants all AI labs to immediately cease, for at least the next six months, all AI training programs that are more powerful than GPT-4. He also commented on the petition, stating that it is \u201casking for too little to solve\u201d the problems posed by the rapid and uncontrolled development of AI systems.\n\nThese AI systems do \u201cnot care for us nor for sentient life in general,\u201d Yudkowsky argues, adding that in order to survive an encounter with one, a person would need \u201cprecision and preparation and new scientific insights\u201d that, generally speaking, humanity lacks.\n\n\u201cA sufficiently intelligent AI won\u2019t stay confined to computers for long,\u201d he added, further explaining that it is already possible to email DNA strands to a laboratory that can manufacture proteins for AI \u201cto build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing.\u201d\n\nIt is the stuff of the Terminator movie franchise but in real life, in other words. And it is happening faster than many people realize as the media distracts everyone with just about every other topic under the sun.\n\n\u201cThere can be no exceptions, including for governments or militaries,\u201d Yudkowsky says about how all AI systems need to be stopped immediately.\n\n\u201cIf intelligence says that a country outside the agreement is building a GPU (graphics processing unit) cluster, be less scared of a shooting conflict between nations than of the moratorium being violated; be willing to destroy a rogue datacenter by airstrike.\u201d\n\nHow to get every country of the world on board with stopping AI could prove challenging, though. Is it even possible to regulate such a thing, especially when it is taking place in private in the remotest areas of the world outside the control or even the knowledge of law enforcement?\n\nYudkowsky sees AI as such a threat that he thinks it should be made \u201cexplicit in international diplomacy that preventing AI extinction scenarios is considered a priority above preventing a full nuclear exchange.\u201d\n\nIn the comments, someone joked that \u201cfirst it was aliens, then it was a zombie apocalypse, and now it\u2019s terminator robots,\u201d the implication being that perhaps Yudkowsky and his ilk are overblowing the AI threat.\n\n\u201cIt has been a well acknowledged and accepted fact that technological, and biological products have been already developed and operating within the military complex for many years before any public awareness!\u201d suggested another. \u201cAre these bio artificial intelligence human form androids already among us?\u201d\n\nWill the world be taken over by demon-possessed AI robots?
