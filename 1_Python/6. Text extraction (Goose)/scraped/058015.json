The racial criterion seemed to assume non-white students are automatically disadvantaged. Isn\u2019t that a little bit racist?\u201d\n\nA Cambridge lecturer in divinity, Dr. James Orr, added that, while the idea was excellent, \u201cthis kind of opportunity should surely be available to everyone on the basis of merit and need, not ethnic background. Undergraduates from ethnic minorities do not need a helping hand from the university to progress to graduate research. If it is the case that the decision has been reversed, the administration should be commended for doing the right thing.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Cambridge University blocked White students from applying for post-graduate programme", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2023-02-28-cambridge-university-blocked-white-students-from-applying.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "It has been revealed that the University of Cambridge had initially blocked white working-class students from applying for a post-graduate programme designed to \u2018give opportunity to students from underrepresented groups\u2019.
