Silkie Carlo and Mark Johnson of Big Brother Watch, along with Adam Brooks, a pub landlord and political commentator, were also targeted for criticizing so-called \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UK government also considered flagging Toby Young posts to Twitter while Peter Hitchens and Daily Mail journalist Ross Clark were targeted for criticizing lockdowns, just as Keir Starmer, Andy Burnham, MP Chris Green were targeted for criticizing tiered regulations and local lockdowns,\u201d reported Reclaim the Net. \u201cStarmer is the leader of the Labour Party and Andy Burnham is the Mayor of Manchester.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government is spying on and punishing \u201cmisinformation\u201d spreaders, too\n\nMind you, what was happening in the UK as far as censorship goes was far more limited than what was happening, and continues to happen, here in the United States.\n\nOver there, potential \u201copinion-makers\u201d were the primary targets of the government\u2019s spying and surveillance operation. Here in the States, anyone who tries to tell the truth online faces potential punishment by Big Tech and the government.\n\nWe now know that in the UK, a military division called the 77th Brigade was brought in to help with that country\u2019s \u201cinformation\u201d warfare operations. It was a whistleblower from the 77th Brigade who came forward to spill the beans that let us all know about his group\u2019s involvement.\n\nThat whistleblower \u201clift[ed] the lid on the \u2018sentiment analysis\u2019 the 77th Brigade conducted, looking at how people viewed the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThrough a number of Freedom of Information requests, Big Brother Watch also determined that the following were also involved in Great Britain\u2019s censorship operations: the Counter Disinformation Unit (covering government response from the Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport, as well as the Rapid Response Unit in the Cabinet Office) and the Foreign Office\u2019s Government Information Cell, and the Research, Intelligence and Communications Unit in the Home Office.\n\n\u201cThis is an alarming case of mission creep, where public money and even military power have been misused to monitor academics, journalists, campaigners and members of parliament who criticized the government, particularly during the pandemic,\u201d commented Big Brother Watch Director Silkie Carlo.\n\nAs we also reported, Twitter hired its own army of FBI agents to help with these surveillance operations both domestically and abroad.\n\n\u201cTwitter is just another arm of government newspeak,\u201d wrote a commenter here at Natural News about the deceptive nature of this \u201csocial media\u201d platform. \u201cCensor any opposition to the party line.\u201d\n\nThe latest censorship-related news can be found at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Governments spied on high-profile journalists, politicians that were critical of covid policy", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-02-01-governments-spied-journalists-politicians-critical-covid-policy.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "A new report from Big Brother Watch details how the British government hired contractors to spy on high-profile journalists and politicians to ensure they followed the script of the official covid narrative.
