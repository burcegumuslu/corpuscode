Our conversation is based on the Government's own data, and yet it is this material and statistics which breaks open the web of lies around the Covid-19 vaccination programme, and the serious dangers of vaccine adverse reactions.\n\nMy voice was the problem in the recording, not the audio editing, so please stay with it, as this is the most important No Smoke Without Fire on the subject of vaccines and vaccine damage, and leads the audience towards the ultimate goal of a state where the Members of Parliament are frightened of their own government. If we allow it to happen, this is just one step on the route to a One World Government\u2014not our words, but those of former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "UKColumn", "type": "video", "url": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/no-smoke-without-fire-part-4-vaccines-lies-damned-lies-and-statistics", "title": "No Smoke Without Fire Part 4: Vaccines \u2014 Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics", "description": "Brian Gerrish and Debi Evans' conversation is based on the Government's own data, and yet it is this material and statistics which breaks open the web of lies around the Covid-19 vaccination programme, and the serious dangers of vaccine adverse reactions.", "image": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/Screenshot%202022-06-27%20at%2010.22.51.png"}, "tags": ["Defence", "Brexit", "Justice", "Coronavirus", "Media", "Politics", "International", "Economy", "Constitution", "Health", "Mind", "Technology", "Faith", "Environment", "Science", "Children & Education"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-06-27T10:19:15+01:00"}
