New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has now required the vaccine for all teachers and school staff. The Pentagon is proceeding with its mandate for all military service members.\n\nBut there are several bizarre aspects to the FDA approval that will prove confusing to those not familiar with the pervasiveness of the FDA\u2019s regulatory capture, or the depths of the agency\u2019s cynicism.\n\nFirst, the FDA acknowledges that while Pfizer has \u201cinsufficient stocks\u201d of the newly licensed Comirnaty vaccine available, there is \u201ca significant amount\u201d of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine \u2014 produced under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) \u2014 still available for use.\n\nThe FDA decrees that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine under the EUA should remain unlicensed but can be used \u201cinterchangeably\u201d (page 2, footnote 8) with the newly licensed Comirnaty product.\n\nSecond, the FDA pointed out that the licensed Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine and the existing, EUA Pfizer vaccine are \u201clegally distinct,\u201d but proclaims that their differences do not \u201cimpact safety or effectiveness.\u201d\n\nThere is a huge real-world difference between products approved under EUA compared with those the FDA has fully licensed.\n\nEUA products are experimental under U.S. law. Both the Nuremberg Code and federal regulations provide that no one can force a human being to participate in this experiment. Under 21 U.S. Code Sec.360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III), \u201cauthorization for medical products for use in emergencies,\u201d it is unlawful to deny someone a job or an education because they refuse to be an experimental subject. Instead, potential recipients have an absolute right to refuse EUA vaccines.\n\nU.S. laws, however, permit employers and schools to require students and workers to take licensed vaccines.\n\nEUA-approved COVID vaccines have an extraordinary liability shield under the 2005 Public Readiness and Preparedness Act. Vaccine manufacturers, distributors, providers and government planners are immune from liability. The only way an injured party can sue is if he or she can prove willful misconduct, and if the U.S. government has also brought an enforcement action against the party for willful misconduct. No such lawsuit has ever succeeded.\n\nThe government has created an extremely stingy compensation program, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, to redress injuries from all EUA products. The program\u2019s parsimonious administrators have compensated under 4% of petitioners to date \u2014 and not a single COVID vaccine injury \u2014 despite the fact that physicians, families and injured vaccine recipients have reported more than 600,000 COVID vaccine injuries.\n\nAt least for the moment, the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine has no liability shield. Vials of the branded product, which say \u201cComirnaty\u201d on the label, are subject to the same product liability laws as other U.S. products.\n\nWhen the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices places a vaccine on the mandatory schedule, a childhood vaccine benefits from a generous retinue of liability protections.\n\nBut licensed adult vaccines, including the new Comirnaty, do not enjoy any liability shield. Just as with Ford\u2019s exploding Pinto, or Monsanto\u2019s herbicide Roundup, people injured by the Comirnaty vaccine could potentially sue for damages.\n\nAnd because adults injured by the vaccine will be able to show that the manufacturer knew of the problems with the product, jury awards could be astronomical.\n\nPfizer is therefore unlikely to allow any American to take a Comirnaty vaccine until it can somehow arrange immunity for this product.\n\nGiven this background, the FDA\u2019s acknowledgement in its approval letter that there are insufficient stocks of the licensed Comirnaty, but an abundant supply of the EUA Pfizer BioNTech jab, exposes the \u201capproval\u201d as a cynical scheme to encourage businesses and schools to impose illegal jab mandates.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s clear motivation is to enable Pfizer to quickly unload inventories of a vaccine that science and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System have exposed as unreasonably dangerous, and that the Delta variant has rendered obsolete.\n\nAmericans, told that the Pfizer COVID vaccine is now licensed, will understandably assume COVID vaccine mandates are lawful. But only EUA-authorized vaccines, for which no one has any real liability, will be available during the next few weeks when many school mandate deadlines occur.\n\nThe FDA appears to be purposefully tricking American citizens into giving up their right to refuse an experimental product.\n\nWhile the media has trumpeted that the FDA has approved COVID vaccines, the FDA has not approved the Pfizer BioNTech vaccines, nor any COVID vaccines for the 12- to 15-year age group, nor any booster doses for anyone.\n\nAnd the FDA has not licensed any Moderna vaccine, nor any vaccine from Johnson & Johnson \u2014 so the vast majority, if not all, of vaccines available in the U.S. remain unlicensed EUA products.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know when somebody orders you to get the vaccine: Ask to see the vial. If it says \u201cComirnaty,\u201d it\u2019s a licensed product.\n\nIf it says \u201cPfizer-BioNTech,\u201d it\u2019s an experimental product, and under 21 U.S. Code 360bbb, you have the right to refuse.\n\nIf it comes from Moderna or Johnson & Johnson (marketed as Janssen), you have the right to refuse.\n\nThe FDA is playing bait and switch with the American public \u2014 but we don\u2019t have to play along. If it doesn\u2019t say Comirnaty, you have not been offered an approved vaccine.\n\nLike Waking Times on Facebook.
