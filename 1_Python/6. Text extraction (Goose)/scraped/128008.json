Instead, it\u2019s all about promoting \u201cinclusivity\u201d for a trend that\u2019s supposedly completely \u201cnatural\u201d and occurring all on its own, without the help of LGBTQ activists.\n\n\u201cToys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,\u201d stated Kim Culmone, senior vice president of Mattel Fashion Doll Design, in a recent statement.\n\n\u201cThrough research, we heard that kids don\u2019t want their toys dictated by gender norms,\u201d she added.\n\nMattel is facilitating the creation of a new world order comprised of genderless LGBTQ robots\n\nIn an official Mattel add for the new \u201cgender-neutral\u201d Barbies, the company openly states that \u201ckids right now, especially Gen-Alpha kids \u2026 which are kids under the age of ten \u2026 they see gender very differently, they experience gender very differently.\u201d\n\nThe video goes on to suggest that Mattel is simply doing its part in response to this by \u201cchalleng[ing] people\u2019s point of view on how children should play.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Mattel wants the public to believe that because children are somehow already identifying as transgenders all on their own \u2013 again, supposedly with no prodding or influence from anyone else \u2013 corporations have a duty to feed into this by pushing it even more via children\u2019s toys.\n\n\u201cThis is the wave of the future,\u201d stated Mattel\u2019s head of research in a shockingly Orwellian statement defending this controversial decision.\n\n\u201cThis is where society is heading. The parents want to be onboard on it, they just don\u2019t have the tools or the knowledge to kind of guide their child.\u201d\n\nOn YouTube, many users responded to these claims with a heavy dose of rationality, including the fact that \u201cno kid actually asked for this,\u201d adding that \u201can adult just assumed it.\u201d Others offered similar commentary, explaining that \u201c[o]nly the immoral parents who don\u2019t care about their children will buy this garbage [for] their kids.\u201d\n\nFor more related news about how the LGBTQ agenda is destroying childhood innocence and creating an entire generation of gender dysphoric individuals who are confused and lost, be sure to check out Evil.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Another evil corporation targets children for psychological warfare and \u201cgender fluid\u201d indoctrination: Mattel releases gender-neutral Barbie dolls", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2019-11-26-mattel-releases-gender-neutral-barbie-dolls.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Children\u2019s toy manufacturer Mattel has introduced a new \u201cgender-neutral\u201d Barbie that aims to further indoctrinate today\u2019s youth into the cult of LGBTQ.
