They'll say\n\nlook, that's why we need vaccines, what's your argument?\n\nLiam Scheff: That's what I said, I mean people would tell me that vaccines\n\nweren't good, and I said well what about polio? Some people shrug their\n\nshoulders and say, \"Well I don't think...\"\n\nI don't know, when I came into it, I had some friends say, \"Just go do the\n\nIt was as though they were sending me on a mission. I had friends arguing\n\nwith me, and I said, \"Well, what about...\"\n\nAnd they said, \"Well I think it was other things, other things,\" and they\n\nhad convinced themselves, but I needed very, very, very specific evidence.\n\nThe interesting thing about polio is it's like AIDS, or it's like any other\n\nlarge disease category. There's so many different things that are called\n\npolio. If my leg tingled a little right now, or let's say I had a bad\n\ncramp, and I was a certain age, and the cramp was persistent for a few\n\ndays, that would be polio, and it went away.\n\nLet's say that I felt nauseous after going to the swimming pool in the\n\nsummer of 1948, that would be considered polio. Let's say that I was... god\n\nbut it does, it did. After what? After going into the swimming pool, after\n\nrunning behind the fogging truck. Well, what was the fogging truck?\n\nThey decided that the paralysis that they had seen some significant cases\n\nof in the early 19th century were caused by a germ or something spread by\n\nflies, and they decided to spray for those flies. So, they sprayed\n\nsomething that you might remember from your history books, if you read\n\n\"Silent Spring\" called DDT, which is a potent neurotoxin, which kills\n\ninsects, but of course has no effect on children. Right?\n\nIt's in my poster book, which is for sale; there are DDT advertisements\n\nfrom the 50's, \"Trims wall paper with DDT keeps your child safe. DDT is\n\ngood for me, it's great on cows, it's great in your milk, great on your\n\nchildren\". Well, this is a paralysis-inducing chemical compound, so polio\n\nrates went up, but you could say, \"What happened before that? Why was there\n\nany paralysis in the early 20th century?\"\n\npresented this to Congress in the early 50's, I want to say, when they were\n\ntrying to chase a bug that they wanted to blame for this. He said, \"Well,\n\nactually geniuses, we were spraying something on the fields in the fruit\n\nthat children are eating, and it was called Paris Green, it was called Lead\n\nArsenate. It's Lead and Arsenic, lead and arsenic, lead and arsenic, let's\n\nsee, it kills people, it kills people, okay, so maybe if you give this to\n\nsmall children they might become paralyzed or die. Well that happened.\n\nThen he was looking through... Janine Roberts wrote a wonderful article for\n\na scientific magazine, I can't remember at present, and Jim West did great\n\nresearch in measuring the amount of DDT production in the incident of polio\n\ncases. DDT and polio, DDT and polio, DDT and polio, huh? What a\n\ncoincidence, so let's look at the mainstream's proof. They decided that a\n\nstomach bug was responsible. The stomach bug passes through the feces. It\n\ncomes out, nobody has any idea how it could possibly get into the nervous\n\nsystem, or cause any kind of paralysis.\n\n[inaudible 03:46] we're still working on it. They don't care, people\n\nbelieve it. But they got rid of DDT and they put out a vaccine, After the\n\nvaccine there was a spike in polio cases, because the vaccine caused\n\nparalysis. It caused injury. So they said \"Whoops, it was a bad batch\".\n\nThen they did something very clever, they decided that the polio that had\n\nbeen polio wasn't polio anymore. In other words, if I had that cramp for\n\nthree days, I had polio. But, now I had to have that cramp for 60 days. I\n\nhad to have a cramp for two months, and the majority of polio cases in the\n\n90th something percentile were the cramps that went away.\n\nThe CDC today says that the polio stomach bug causes paralysis, I mean I'd\n\nlike the audience to guess: What's the percentage of time that polio causes\n\npolio? It would be depending on your definition of polio, right? Is it 50\n\npercent? Is it 70? Their answer is .1 to .5 percent of the time. So, with\n\npolio then becomes the virus that causes polio, except for 99.9% of the\n\ntime. And, that's them.\n\nDo you believe them? I don't. You spray lead and arsenic, you give it to\n\nkids, they called it the summer plague. What do you do in the summer? You\n\ngo to the pool. You eat the fruit. You eat sugar, lower your immune system.\n\nThere's great evidence for this. It's really there in the history books,\n\nbut we like to believe this myth, chapter five, hey it's in a book called", "opengraph": {"site_name": "iHealthTube.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ihealthtube.com/video/debunking-polio-vaccine", "title": "Debunking The Polio Vaccine", "description": "http://www.ihealthtube.com    Many vaccine proponents will point to polio as a major reason for vaccines.
