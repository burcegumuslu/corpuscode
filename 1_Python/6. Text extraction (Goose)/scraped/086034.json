Marin County, California, United States, has a history of vaccine hesitancy regarding childhood vaccinations required for school entry.\n\nObjectives: We aimed to describe and address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Marin County to inform outreach and messaging. Our objectives were to identify subgroups with high COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy early in distribution, better understand local concerns and feedback about the COVID-19 vaccine distribution process, and inform tailored vaccine messaging to increase vaccination confidence and coverage.\n\nMethods: The survey,\u00a0which was administered from January 3 to May 10, 2021, queried demographics, vaccine acceptance, reasons for hesitancy, and reasons for acceptance. Open-ended questions were used for respondents to report additional reasons for hesitancy and for general feedback about the vaccine distribution process. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses stratified by COVID-19 vaccine acceptance to identify subgroups with high hesitancy. Results were shared weekly in real-time with leadership and key community partners working on vaccine outreach.\n\nResults: Among the 5,618 survey responses, there were differences in vaccine hesitancy by sociodemographic characteristics with the highest hesitancy reported among subgroups identifying as Black/African American and young adult, and within the lowest family income grouping. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy was \u201cuncertain about the side effects of the vaccine\u201d (67.3% endorsement) and responses varied by race and ethnicity. Qualitative data revealed equity-related, vaccine distribution, and vaccine access themes that were not present in structured responses. Vaccine hesitancy survey results were paired with vaccination coverage and COVID-19 case data to inform tailored outreach strategies and priorities week-to-week.\n\nConclusions: Marin County had some of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States during the pandemic and met equity goals aimed at ensuring vulnerable populations received vaccinations. Presenting real-time survey findings with leadership and key community partners informed a timely and tailored COVID-19 vaccine outreach and delivery strategy.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/114885-covid-19-vaccine-perceptions-survey-for-real-time-vaccine-outreach-in-marin-county-california", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine Perceptions Survey for Real-Time Vaccine Outreach in Marin County, California", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
