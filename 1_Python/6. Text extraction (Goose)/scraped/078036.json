Meetings with Congressional Members, Senators, and staff took place over a four-day time period to explain WMP\u2019s six-step Vaccine Safety Project that details the actions necessary to introduce sound science and transparency to our vaccination program. Federally elected officials can no longer ignore the chronic health conditions\u2014tied in no small part to adverse vaccine reactions\u2014that currently affect over half of our nation\u2019s children. Not only are these officials now aware of the conflicts of interest and upon which the vaccine program is built, but they have been given a common-sense plan for enacting desperately needed changes that puts children\u2019s health first.\n\nThe long-term health effects of our vaccine program are inadequately studied and our regulatory bodies are conflicted. Childhood health epidemics have mushroomed along with the childhood vaccine schedule.\n\nVaccines contain many ingredients, some of which are known to be neurotoxic, carcinogenic and cause autoimmunity. Vaccines injuries can and do happen. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded almost $4 billion for vaccine injuries since 1988.\n\nCommon sense dictates that these actions must be taken:\n\u2022 Require reporting of vaccine adverse events. Automate (VAERS) and (VSD) databases for research.\n\u2022 Ensure all parties involved with federal vaccine approvals and recommendations are free from conflicts of interest.\n\u2022 Reevaluate all vaccines recommended by the (ACIP) prior to the adoption of evidence-based guidelines.\n\u2022 Study what makes some individuals more susceptible to vaccine injury.\n\nThe Six Steps to Vaccine Safety\n\nThe details regarding each of the six steps to vaccine safety were discussed with members of Congress, Senators and staff to help them understand why they must act now to stop the childhood epidemics.\n\u2022 Vaccines are regulated by the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) division as \u201cbiologics\u201d and are not always put through the same level of safety testing as new pharmaceuticals, which are regulated under the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER.)\n\u2022 Vaccines, which are given to healthy patients, should be tested more rigorously than drugs because they are not given to treat an existing disease.\n\u2022 Inadequate testing currently ensures that the true risk/benefit assessments for the safety and cost of vaccines are impossible to calculate accurately.\n\u2022 These vaccines are given to about 4 million American infants annually.\n\n#2: Require reporting of vaccine adverse events. Automate (VAERS) and (VSD) databases for research.\n\nReporting and study of adverse events after receipt of vaccines is currently haphazard and antiquated. Since these two databases are the primary sources of U.S. post-licensure surveillance, serious side effects of vaccination that were unclear or not seen in clinical trials will be missed.\n\nThe VAERS is the online system into which doctors and patients report adverse events after vaccination. HHS admits that the system likely records only about 1% of the actual adverse events but even after a three-year HHS/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( ) study showed the feasibility of automating reports using electronic medical records, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has been non-responsive to \u201cmultiple requests to proceed with testing and evaluation.\u201d\n\u2022 Clinical trials for vaccines typically only enroll a few thousand patients in total. When vaccines are subsequently approved for use in populations of millions of healthy individuals, it is imperative that rates of known adverse events and any new or rare adverse events are monitored.\n\u2022 Without adequate safety follow-up, serious side effects may be missed entirely putting the public at risk (examples of the past importance of safety follow-up include hormone replacement therapy, Vioxx and amphetamines).\n\u2022 There has never been a comparative study of broad health outcomes in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations.\n\u2022 Any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine; or\n\u2022 Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination.\n\nBut, in practice, this doesn\u2019t happen. There is no consequence for failing to report an injury. There is no mechanism for prosecution of non-compliance and, therefore, no incentive for a busy doctor to report vaccine safety problems.\n\nThe VSD is a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office and eight private health care organizations. The VSD was started in 1990 to monitor safety of vaccines and conduct studies about rare and serious adverse events following immunization. However, research is currently hampered by lack of broad access to this publicly-funded database, variability of reporting and the statistical structure of the database.\n\n#3: Ensure all parties involved with federal vaccine approvals and recommendations are free from conflicts of interest.\n\nFDA\u2019s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) is responsible for licensing vaccines. CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is responsible for adding vaccines to the recommended schedules.\n\u2022 CDC or NIH Employees whose names appear on vaccine patents can receive up to $150k in licensing fees per year (in perpetuity).\n\u2022 Regarding VRBAC, a House OGR Committee Report found that the \u201coverwhelming majority of members, both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d and \u201ccommittee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies have been given waivers to participate in committee proceedings.\u201d\n\u2022 A similar report on the ACIP found that, \u201cThe CDC grants blanket waivers to the ACIP members each year that allow them to deliberate on any subject, regardless of their conflicts, for the entire year.\u201d\n\nA 2009 HHS Office of the Inspector General report found that:\n\u2022 \u201cCDC had a systemic lack of oversight of the ethics program.\u201d\n\u2022 58 percent had at least one unidentified potential conflict.\n\u2022 32 percent had at least one conflict that remained unresolved.\n\u2022 CDC continued to grant broad waivers to members with conflicts.\n\nAll vaccine regulatory agencies must rigorously enforce their ethics policies to ensure that our vaccine program is free from financial conflicts of interest.\n\n#4 Reevaluate all vaccines recommended by the (ACIP) prior to the adoption of evidence-based guidelines.\n\nA yes vote by ACIP results in:\n\u2022 Mandating the vaccine to millions of children.\n\u2022 Immunity from liability for the manufacturers.\n\u2022 Inclusion in the Vaccines for Children program.\n\nHowever, prior to 2012, ACIP did not use evidence-based guidelines to evaluate their vaccine recommendations. Evidence Based Practice is \u201cthe conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of the individual patient. It means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.\u201d The final ACIP guidelines published in November of 2013 outlined clearly, for the first time, a standardized plan to evaluate the quality and strength of the research behind each recommendation for a vaccine for each population. ACIP\u2019s recommendations include the populations, timing, spacing, number of doses, boosters and appropriate ages for each vaccine to be administered.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s infant schedule, given to approximately 4 million babies a year, was largely adopted before these guidelines were in place. Vaccines recommended before the adoption of evidence-based guidelines should not have been \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in. Earlier ACIP recommendations should be thoroughly reviewed in light of the new guidelines and current research.\n\n#5 Study what makes some individuals more susceptible to vaccine injury.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) has issued three disturbing reports on the evidence for suspected and/or reported vaccine adverse events.\n\nFor 80% of the suspected vaccine adverse conditions investigated, there wasn\u2019t enough research evidence to accept or reject vaccine causation. Of the reviews with sufficient evidence, 72% found that the vaccine did likely cause the injury.\n\nIn 2013, the IOM studied the entire Childhood Immunization Schedule and stated:\n\nThe Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid out over $3.8 billion in compensation to victims of vaccine injury. The children and adults who have been compensated for injuries have never been studied to determine why they were injured, in an effort to make vaccines safer for everyone. Preventing vaccine injuries should be tackled as zealously as we tackle preventing infectious diseases.\n\nVaccine safety science, particularly long-term safety science, is inadequate to ensure children\u2019s safety or to accurately assess risks for purposes of informed consent.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics statement on the ethics of informed consent includes the following stipulation, \u201cpatients should have explanations, in understandable language, of \u2026; the existence and nature of the risks involved; and the existence, potential benefits, and risks of recommended alternative treatments (including the choice of no treatment).\u201d\n\nIn the case of vaccination, informed consent is often ignored completely in real world settings.\n\nIn practice, particularly when multiple vaccines are administered on the same day, many parents report that they received the Vaccine Information Sheet (VIS) as they left and there was no explanation of information before a vaccine was given. It is also rare that medical history is thoroughly discussed to identify contraindications to a vaccine. For example, a patient with a family history of autoimmunity is likely at increased risk for an autoimmune reaction after vaccination.\n\nThe following are examples of the types of information that patients may learn after the fact from the Vaccine Information Sheets:\n\u2022 \u201cSevere events have very rarely been reported following MMR vaccination, and might also happen after MMRV. These include: Deafness, long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness, brain damage.\u201d\n\u2022 Or this from the Polio VIS and several others: \u201cAs with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death.\u201d\n\nLack of informed consent encompasses vaccine advertising as well. While television drug ads disclose the side effect risks of that drug at length, vaccine advertising does not. The patient, again, is at a disadvantage.\n\nRobert O\u2019Leary, JD BARA, has had an abiding interest in alternative health products & modalities since the early 1970\u2019s & he has seen how they have made people go from lacking health to vibrant health.
