Although the deadline set by the university system for compliance is not until December 1, UC San Diego (UCSD) moved its deadline to November 18. Students were notified of the mandate on November 8, giving them just 10 days to comply.\n\nThose who fail to get the flu shot must join those who were unwilling to get the COVID-19 vaccine in wearing masks and submitting to routine resting. The university\u2019s policy requires those affected by the mandate to \u201c(i) receive Vaccine Education concerning influenza and vaccination as a preventive measure; and (ii) receive or affirmatively decline influenza vaccination,\u201d according to an announcement by UC San Diego.\n\nThe policy states: \u201cCovered Individuals who are not vaccinated must observe additional Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) (e.g., masks or specialized personal protective equipment; routine testing) as directed by the Location Vaccine Authority (LVA) to mitigate risk to members of the University community, patients, and others with whom they interact.\u201d\n\nUCSD is blaming \u201clax masking and social distancing\u201d for rising flu cases there, even though there is little evidence that masking and social distancing help. This is despite the fact that masking is currently required in the university\u2019s classrooms and clinical areas as well as on university transportation.\n\nThey are also doubling down on the guilt trip \u201cgreater good\u201d rhetoric that was used to coerce people into getting COVID-19 jabs, saying in the policy: \u201cFinally, by getting vaccinated, a person can protect those around them, including those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness.\u201d Like COVID-19, flu vaccines do not stop people from contracting the virus or spreading it.\n\nSome colleges are dropping mandates, while others are doubling down\n\nAlthough many institutions of higher education around the nation have been easing their COVID-19 vaccine policies, others are remaining steadfast in violating students\u2019 health freedom.\n\nA law group in Long Island is currently preparing to file a lawsuit against a COVID-19 booster mandate at Fordham University. The university sent an email in late September informing students, staff and faculty that they must have their COVID-19 primary series as well as two boosters by November 1; those who fail to comply will be \u201cbarred, disenrolled or dismissed.\u201d\n\nMermigis Law Group Senior Partner James Mermigis pointed out that the move is a breach of an implied contract as the announcement came after everyone had already paid their tuition and started the semester.\n\nHe told the Bronx Times: \u201cIf Fordham continues with this, they\u2019re conducting a science experiment on these students. This is ridiculous, it\u2019s overkill, it\u2019s almost three years (since) COVID began.\u201d\n\nFordham is the only college in New York state requiring updated boosters for faculty, staff and students.\n\nYale University issued a mandate on October 27 ordering students to receive bivalent COVID-19 boosters by the beginning of the spring 2023 semester, but the mandate there does not apply to faculty and staff. The university set up mobile booster vans the following week to issue COVID-19 boosters and flu shots.\n\nChief Quality Officer at Yale Health Madeline Wilson told the Yale Daily News that if cases rise significantly, indoor masking could be required, along with other public health measures.\n\nUnfortunately, these campus vaccine mandates are becoming all too common, and it won\u2019t be surprising to see lots of other vaccines added onto them in the years to come.", "opengraph": {"title": "OBEY: University of California announces flu vaccine mandate for all campuses", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2022-11-18-university-california-flu-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "The University of California has announced that it is instituting an annual flu vaccine mandate on top of its existing COVID-19 vaccine mandate, forcing students, faculty, staff and other academic appointees to open themselves up to the many dangerous side effects of the jab.
