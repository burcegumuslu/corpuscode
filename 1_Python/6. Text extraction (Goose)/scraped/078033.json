So very few answers.\n\nDysregulated continual synthesis of IL-6 plays a pathological effect on chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.\n\nSo that\u2019s what they found in the paper, in a very small nutshell. Figure 3 (below) shows the design and some of the results of their essays.\n\nIt basically shows fold-changes in Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (these guys activate macrophages and induce MHC-II molecule expression) and TNF-alpha in response to stimulation of blood cells from injected people using TLR stimulation with various pathogens.\n\nThe bottom line here is this\n\nWe know that innate responses are vital to a healthy and optimally functioning immune system. They are vitally integrated with and into the adaptive responses as these two branches work in impeccable, complex harmony.\n\nWe also know that there are cases where vaccines have caused dysregulation of innate responses in humans.\n\nWe also know that something is very, very wrong with these COVID-19 injectable products with regards to persistent hyper inflammation and a plethora of systemic and physiologically-comprehensive adverse events including death from micro-emboli formation and clotting.\n\nWe also know that these authors have now provided evidence to support that these COVID-19 injectable products are modulating innate responses and that this isn\u2019t limited to problems with COVID-19.\n\nProblems with fungi, other viruses, and bacteria can be anticipated.\n\nVAERS has hundreds of thousands of reports of adverse events related to fungal infections, plagues of herpes zoster occurrences (shingles) indicating weakened immunity, cancers coming out of remission, and the list goes on. And most of these reports are made for adults.\n\nSince children have extraordinary capabilities with regards to dealing with COVID-19 via their innate immune system responses, what will happen to them if these are not only bypassed by these injections but knocked down by them?\n\nThe kids are alright. Leave them alone.\n\nYou might not get how these circles back the kids, but it does.\n\nThanks for reading this to the end. And don\u2019t inject kids with this stuff. You might mess them up and they don\u2019t need it.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8379462/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25190079/", "https://jessicar.substack.com/p/the-bnt162b2-mrna-vaccine-against"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
