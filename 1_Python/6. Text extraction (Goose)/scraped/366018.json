Gaw, Assistant Professor of Maternal-Foetal Medicine at UCSF.\n\n\"We didn't detect the vaccine associated with mRNA in any of the milk samples tested,\" said lead author Yarden Golan, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF. \"These findings provide experimental evidence regarding the safety of the use of mRNA-based vaccines during lactation.\"\n\nThe study was conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. The mothers' mean age was 37.8 years and their children ranged in age from one month to three years. Milk samples were collected prior to vaccination and at various times up to 48 hours after vaccination.\n\nResearchers found that none of the samples showed detectable levels of vaccine mRNA in any component of the milk.\n\nHowever, the authors noted that the study was limited by the small sample size and said that further clinical data from larger populations were needed to better estimate the effect of the vaccines on lactation outcomes.
