We need authentic leadership and that means treating the pandemic and the climate crisis for what they are: an interconnected inequality emergency.\n\n\u201cThe G7 have failed to set us up for a successful COP26 as trust is sorely lacking between rich and developing countries. Rebuilding this essential multilateral trust means supporting the TRIPS waiver for a People\u2019s Vaccine, delivering on commitments for climate finance for the most vulnerable countries, and kicking fossil fuels out of politics once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe solutions to the climate emergency are clear and available, but the G7\u2019s refusal to do what\u2019s needed is leaving the world\u2019s vulnerable behind. To fight COVID-19, supporting a TRIPS waiver for a People\u2019s Vaccine is crucial. To lead us out of the climate emergency, the G7 needed to deliver clear plans to quickly phase out fossil fuels and commitments to immediately stop all new fossil fuel development with a just transition. Where is the clear national implementation with deadlines and where is the climate finance so urgently needed for the most vulnerable countries?\n\n\u201cA resourced plan to protect at least 30% of our land and sea is missing, yet urgently needed. Nature protection must be realised in partnership with local and Indigenous Peoples within this decade. Otherwise pandemics stand to become a nightmarish norm against the backdrop of climate catastrophe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis summit feels like a broken record of the same old promises. There\u2019s a new commitment to ending overseas investment in coal, which is their piece de resistance. But without agreeing to end all new fossil fuel projects \u2013 something that must be delivered this year if we are to limit dangerous rises in global temperature \u2013 this plan falls very short.\n\n\u201cThe G7\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go anywhere near far enough when it comes to a legally binding agreement to stop the decline of nature by 2030. And the finance being offered to poorer nations is simply not new, nor enough, to match the scale of the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson and his fellow leaders have buried their heads in the Cornish sand rather than rising to the environmental challenge we all face.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "G7 leaves vulnerable behind in COVID-19 and climate emergency - Greenpeace International", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/48362/g7-leaves-vulnerable-behind-covid19-climate", "description": "At the conclusion of the G7 Summit, Greenpeace is calling for faster and more ambitious action to respond to COVID-19 and the climate emergency.", "image": "https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-international-stateless/2021/06/1ecdfe19-gp1sv9fx.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "site_name": "Greenpeace International"}, "tags": ["# Health", "# Climate"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7dad5d8c2c3f7d0c5d2d2d9c7d2d6d4d299d8c5d0", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3242405741411c475972554057575c42575351571c5d4055", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f686849385859293859dd89f9882b691849393988693979593d8998491"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "13 June 2021"}
