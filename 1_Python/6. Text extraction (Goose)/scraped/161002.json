Matthew Lynn in the Telegraph wrote a shocking article, arguing that \u201cno jab, no job policy should be the law.\u201d\n\nThere are lots of jobs where you can\u2019t work from home, and plenty of factories and offices that will remain closed if people don\u2019t get vaccinated.\n\nOf course, no one should be forced to take the jjab if they don\u2019t want to.\n\nBut they have to accept it may limit their employment options. Businesses already face plenty of uncertainty without the additional anxiety of a blizzard of legal claims.\n\nThe solution is simple. Parliament should legislate for no jab, no job this week \u2013 and that way everyone will know where they stand and can start planning for the future\u2026\n\nOf course, no one should be forced to take the shot if they don\u2019t want to.\n\nThere is an argument for mandatory vaccination, but it is a huge infringement of civil liberties, and we have probably seen enough of those in the past year to last a lifetime. People should be free to choose.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be any consequences of their decision.\n\nThere are plenty of countries where you are only allowed in with a vaccination certificate, and it is up to you whether you want to travel there or not.\n\nIn the same way, anyone who prefers not to be vaccinated may have to accept it limits their employment opportunities. If they don\u2019t like that, tough\u2026\n\nParliament should pass a one-line bill this week making it clear that it is legal to discriminate on the grounds of whether a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19, and that no claims on the grounds of unfair dismissal will be accepted.\n\nThat will settle the matter once and for all, and stop the employment lawyers and unions in their tracks.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany\u2019s jjab committee has said that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jjab should only be given to under-65s, stating there is \u201cinsufficient data to judge how effective the vaccination is above 65 years\u201d.\n\nThis is a blow for the jjab which is much cheaper and easier to store than others like Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s, and which Britain is relying on heavily for its reopening strategy, meaning we need it to work among the most vulnerable. The European Medicines Agency\u2019s decision is due later today.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://humansbefree.com/2021/03/council-of-europe-decrees-jjabs-must-not-be-mandatory-and-the-non-vaccinated-must-not-be-discriminated-against.html", "site_name": "Humans Be Free", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:section": "Uncategorized", "title": "Council of Europe Decrees Vaccines Must Not be Mandatory and the Non-Vaccinated Must Not be Discriminated Against", "description": "Council of Europe Decrees Vaccines Must Not be Mandatory and the Non-Vaccinated Must Not be Discriminated Against", "image": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-European-Court-of-Human-Rights-part-of-the-Council-of-Europe.jpeg", "image:secure_url": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-European-Court-of-Human-Rights-part-of-the-Council-of-Europe.jpeg", "image:width": "870", "image:height": "489", "image:alt": "the european court of human rights, part of the council of europe"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://humansarefree.com/2021/02/council-of-europe-jjab-passports-trample-human-rights.html", "https://pace.coe.int/en/files/29004/html", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/02/council-of-europe-jjab-passports-trample-human-rights.html", "https://humansarefree.com/?s=COVID-19+jjabs", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/01/28/no-jab-no-job-policy-should-law/", "https://humansarefree.com/?s=AstraZeneca+jjab", "https://lockdownsceptics.org/2021/01/29/latest-news-269/#council-of-europe-decrees-jjabs-must-not-be-mandatory-and-the-non-vaccinated-must-not-be-discriminated-against"], "authors": ["HAF"], "publish_date": "2021-03-06T13:00:05"}
