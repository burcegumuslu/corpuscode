Published just before the new year, the Chinese study found that mice who received four or more doses of the mRNA shots designed to combat SARS-CoV-2 experienced discernibly reduced immune function.\n\nThe reduced immune function not only inhibited the mice\u2019s ability to combat COVID-19, but it weakened their natural ability to fight other viruses and bacteria. In fact, the very building blocks of the human immune system may be at risk.\n\nThis is an important finding, as the results could mean that those receiving boosters are destroying the innate immune function that is their first line of defense against illness.\n\nThe researchers don\u2019t mince their words, saying:\n\n\u201cOur findings demonstrate potential risks with the continuous use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters, providing immediate implications for the global COVID-19 vaccination enhancement strategies.\u201d\n\nThe authors acknowledged that policies that promote a second booster \u2013 or even annual boosters \u2013 are being made despite the fact that \u201cscant information\u201d is available. This is a major reason why they chose to conduct their study: to determine the \u201cprotective efficacy and potential adverse effects\u201d of the mRNA shots, which the authors say remains \u201clargely unknown.\u201d\n\nThe socio-political divide surrounding the newly deployed mRNA technology has focused on 2 things:\n\nArguments ranging from travel restrictions to school mandates come down to the cost-benefit analysis of taking the shots. As far as efficacy is concerned, all of the available data indicates that the so-called vaccines are wildly ineffective at stopping infection or transmission (the only two metrics by which mandates and restrictions could possibly be justified).\n\nLarge epidemiological studies keep showing that mRNA jabs have \u201cnegative efficacy\u201d against the coronavirus. In other words, people who received them are more likely to become infected than those who were never vaccinated.\n\nFor example, A study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic and published in December 2022 found that \u201cthe higher the number of vaccines previously received, the higher the risk of contracting COVID-19.\u201d [You can find the full study here.]\n\nOn January 12th of this year, an expansive French study set out to determine the effectiveness of a second mRNA booster compared to a single booster or previous infection. By every metric, the study found that a second booster was less effective than the first. Even worse, people who received a second booster were actually more likely to be infected than those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, people who receive a second mRNA booster are more likely to be infected with COVID-19. By 6 months, that infection risk is already 30% higher than their single-boosted counterparts.\n\nDemonstrating the waning efficacy (and potentially increased risk of infection) should \u2013 at the very least \u2013 put an end to discussions of mandated boosters. But what about the safety of these shots? Is it possible that governments, corporations, and the manufacturers themselves have knowingly or negligently done irreparable harm to a large swath of the population by coercing injection of this untested product?\n\nUnfortunately, this new study suggests that the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nThe scientists injected mice with several doses of purified spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The RBD is the most crucial part of the coronavirus spike protein. It attaches to the receptors on our cells that allow the virus to dump its payload into them.\n\nBioNTech and Pfizer initially considered targeting it alone for their mRNA vaccine before deciding to make a broader version that would cause our cells to make the entire spike. The RBD-only version was called BNT162b1, as opposed to BNT162b2, which ultimately became the version BioNTech and Pfizer sell today.\n\nThe team found that 4 or more doses seemed to exhaust the immune system of the mice, not only in the targeted antibodies but in the B- and T-cells that form the very foundation of the innate immune system.\n\nI cannot stress how important it is to understand the role of B- and T-cells in the immune system. Without them, it becomes nearly impossible to survive.\n\nBoth are types of lymphocytes, which circulate in your blood and are part of your immune system. B-cells produce antibody molecules that can latch on and destroy invading viruses or bacteria. T-cells are direct fighters of foreign invaders and also produce cytokines, which are biological substances that help activate other parts of the immune system.\n\nWithout B-cells, your body would not be as effective at fighting off a number of common bacteria and viruses; and you would lack the long-lasting \u201cmemory antibody\u201d function that is typical after recovering from an infection.\n\nWithout T-cells, every exposure to pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and viruses could be life-threatening.\n\nAs shown in the charts below, extended immunization inhibited the production of RBD-specific memory B cells.\n\nAgain, the study\u2019s authors did not mince their words:\n\n\u201cWhen we administrated additional doses of the same vaccine booster, with the attempt to induce a similarly enhanced or at least sustained immune response, we observed an overt reduction of the overall immune responses.\u201d\n\nYour body\u2019s innate immune system is the most important line of defense against illness and disease. A strong immune response can literally be the difference between life and death when encountering bacteria and viruses as seemingly innocuous as the common cold.\n\nIf the SARS-CoV-2 shots targeting spike protein RBD can indeed destroy the building blocks of the human immune system, mankind could be facing a pandemic that would make COVID-19 seem like child\u2019s play. Hundreds of millions could perish as every virus and bacteria tears through communities.\n\nIt is important to note that we do not know if this same immune response exists in humans. However, the mice the researchers used are genetically altered to model accurately the human response to the coronavirus and have \u201cbeen shown to share profound similarities with humans in response to SARS-CoV-2 infections,\u201d as the paper explains.\n\nThis is not alarmism. This is not sensationalism. There is a very real threat of severe adverse outcomes due to shots that have already been administered over 13 BILLION times to a population of less than 8 billion people. There are more than enough safety signals to support the immediate suspension of these shots pending more extensive, long-term safety data.\n\nThe future of mankind may depend on it.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Research Shows Immune System Destroyed After Second Booster", "description": "New research shows that a second COVID booster inhibits antibody response, leaving recipients more susceptible to infection, and destroys the very building blocks of the human immune system.", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/immune-system-destroyed-second-booster/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:section": "Featured Articles", "article:published_time": "2023-01-31T00:01:38-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-01T16:02:14-04:00", "updated_time": "2023-02-01T16:02:14-04:00", "image": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/TTAC_New-Research-Show-Immune-System-Destroyed-After-Second-Booster_Article_Email-FB-Blog.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222017515?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=7924ff515d132084", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.17.22283625v1.full.pdf", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.11.23284137v1.full-text", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": ["Kevin Stewart Hobson", "Marilyn", "Stacey", "Kim", "Kris Kotsopoulos", "Cathy Melton"], "publish_date": "2023-01-31T00:01:38-04:00"}
