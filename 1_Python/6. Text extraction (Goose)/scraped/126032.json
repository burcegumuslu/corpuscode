Dr. Diane Counce recommends that patients who are not experiencing symptoms of vaccine injury improve gut health and the gut microbiome. She also recommends Nattokinase, NAC and bromelain. For those experiencing symptoms, then treats those specifically - often multiple symptoms at a time. Dr. Suzanne Gazda says she treats post-vaccine symptoms in her patients with the FLCCC I-RECOVER Post Vaccine protocol. She also notes that every patient is different, so they need to be treated individually. She ends on a note of hope - \u201cI\u2019m telling you, people can get better.\u201d\n\u2022 None I am Experiencing Atypical ALS Symptoms Post-Vaccine (Muscle Atrophy, Weakness, Full-Body Pain, etc.). Have you seen this in Others? Dr. Suzanne Gazda says she is seeing patients suffering from ALS, and that the muscles are hit really hard by spike protein, and that muscle wasting is common. Dr. Gazda says a patient suffering from ALS needs to work with a practitioner that is able to help treat this complex disorder. She says she has seen ALS reversals and offers hope.\n\u2022 None Are Rare Disorders like Trisomy 13 Appearing More in Babies of Vaccinated Moms? Dr. James Thorp confirms that he is seeing more rare disorders in babies born to vaccinated mothers, and adds that these chromosomal abnormalities are noted in Pfizer\u2019s own data. He notes that in pregnancy, anything that creates inflammation is dangerous, and that the COVID-19 vaccines are highly inflammatory. Dr. Pierre Kory adds that he has never seen a risk to benefit ratio like this, and that as Dr. Paul Marik says, this is the most toxic drug used in history. Dr. Paul Marik says it is astonishing that people continue to be injected with a toxic protein.\n\u2022 None Juraj tried unsuccessfully to get a medical exemption for the vaccines. He had to travel internationally to keep his job, so chose to go ahead with them. He immediately suffered severe adverse events, including passing out daily and nonstop headaches. When he wasn\u2019t sure how to go on he decided to share his situation on a Telegram group. Through this group, he learned of the FLCCC protocols, and his life turned around after beginning I-RECOVER.
