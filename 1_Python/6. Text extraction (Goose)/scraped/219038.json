Big Ant) to People.\n\n\u201cBut when we pull up, they don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do, they don\u2019t know what we\u2019re capable of doing. So it helps out big time.\u201d\n\nThe street-smart team has also committed to teaching the community about animal abuse and the harm that it does.\n\nAccording to Panz, young folks are often more willing to hear what they have to say; whereas they might be put off by a police constable\u2019s assumption of authority, the bikers have the clout and street credit to convince the younger crowd.\n\nThe organization, founded in 2007, has saved more animals than their members have tattoos.\n\nTheir peak years of activity were between 2008 and 2014.\n\nIn 2009, they even premiered in their own reality television program called \u201cRescue Ink Unleashed,\u201d which aired on National Geographic channel.\n\nThe group\u2019s website sums up who they are and where they\u2019ve been:\n\n\u201cSome people like to think of us as superheroes.\n\n\"The truth is, we are super animal lovers (and protectors).\n\n\"Through the years, and through many caseloads, obstacles, and downright challenges, we remain strong and dedicated to our mission.\u201d\n\n[RELATED] New Animal Protection Bill Could See Abusers Get 7 Years in Prison", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://neonnettle.com/features/1621-vigilante-bikers-rescue-abused-animals-confront-abusive-pet-owners", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/features/images/bikers-rescue-abused-animals-confront-pet-owners-112519.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Vigilante Bikers Rescue Abused Animals, Confront Abusive Pet Owners", "description": "Biker group known as Rescue Ink is saving desperate animals from abuse - A group of burly, tattooed bikers is taking action against abusive pet owners and rescuing abused... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Animals", "Tattoos"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "592", "height": "333", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLCMTUZ4YAI\" width=\"592\" height=\"333\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLCMTUZ4YAI"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "592", "height": "333", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yevRDxK47qM\" width=\"592\" height=\"333\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yevRDxK47qM"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "592", "height": "333", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v3b5nZdcaPQ\" width=\"592\" height=\"333\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/v3b5nZdcaPQ"}], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/tattooed-bikers-confront-abusive-pet-owners-to-rescue-desperate-animals_2873099.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-animal-abuse", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLCMTUZ4YAI", "https://people.com/pets/rescue-inks-tattooed-tough-guys-crack-down-on-animal-cruelty/", "http://www.rescueink.org/mission.html", "../../news/7137-new-animal-protection-bill-could-see-abusers-get-7-years-in-prison"], "authors": ["Neon Nettle"], "publish_date": "2019-06-01"}
