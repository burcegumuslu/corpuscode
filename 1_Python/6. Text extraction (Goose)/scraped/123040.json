Ron DeSantis has signed an emergency order prohibiting vaccine passports in the state. The Republican governor explained that such passports were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d as they create \u201ctwo classes of citizens.\u201d\n\nThe April 2 mandate signed by DeSantis forbids state organizations or private businesses to demand customers show vaccine passports as a requirement for working or obtaining products and services.\n\nDeSantis elaborated on his opposition to vaccine passports during a March 29 press conference. According to DeSantis, requiring the COVID-19 vaccine passports would create \u201ctwo classes of citizens based on vaccination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society,\u201d he said.\n\nDeSantis also took a jab at the fact that large corporations were handling vaccine passport data. He voiced out his concern over possible privacy breaches. The governor remarked: \u201cYou want the fox to guard the henhouse? Give me a break.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s order elicited mixed reactions from lawmakers at the state level.\n\nRepublican Rep. Anthony Sabatini commented that he would work to make it a law in Florida at the soonest. \u201cThis order is immediate, but must be passed into law. I\u2019ll be fighting to make sure this law passes,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith pointed out that DeSantis \u201cis creating even more vaccine hesitancy with [the] reckless order.\u201d He noted that the governor signed the measure while he himself had not yet received the vaccine. Smith later called on DeSantis to \u201cget the shot \u2026 [and] lead by example\u201d in a tweet.\n\nThe governor expressed his intent to get vaccinated in response to the Democratic lawmaker\u2019s challenge.\n\nDeSantis\u2019s order came amid a push toward widespread use of vaccine passports. According to Biden administration officials, there are currently at least 17 different passport initiatives by private and public entities in the pipeline. However, the White House clarified that vaccine passports and other similar measures will not be implemented at the federal level.\n\nDeSantis joins many Republican politicians voicing out their displeasure toward vaccine passports\n\nDeSantis\u2019s mandate also followed comments by GOP lawmakers at the U.S. House of Representatives regarding vaccine passports.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) compared the vaccine passports to the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d mentioned in Revelation 13:16-17. The GOP representative said in a video: \u201cThey want you to have something called a [COVID-19] passport. And this will mandate your ability to travel, go to events and buy and sell.\u201d Greene later tweeted: \u201cIs this something like Biden\u2019s mark of the beast? Because that\u2019s really disturbing and not good.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) slammed the Biden administration\u2019s more stringent approach toward citizens\u2019 freedoms by means of vaccine passports. He compared this to the administration\u2019s disregard of illegal immigration at the southern border. Jordan mentioned the double standard in a tweet: \u201cThe Biden administration: Considering a \u2018vaccination passport\u2019 for Americans, [but] doesn\u2019t seem to care about [a] passport when it comes to illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nU.S. senators from the GOP also joined their counterparts at the lower chamber in rebuking the vaccine passports.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said on Twitter: \u201cIf you think voter ID [laws are] racist, but a vaccine passport is just fine, you need some serious help thinking through public policy. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) agreed with Paul and slammed vaccine passports as \u201cunconstitutional and dangerous.\u201d He wrote on Twitter: \u201cLiberals think requiring an ID for voting is obtrusive and racist. Yet they want public health \u2018experts\u2019 \u2013 who were wrong about nearly everything \u2013 to administer a vaccine passport?\u201d (Related: TWISTED: Biden regime wants to mandate COVID-19 \u201cvaccine passport\u201d for all Americans but continues to oppose voter ID.)\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem tweeted that the proposed COVID-19 vaccine passport \u201cis one of the most un-American ideas in [the] nation\u2019s history\u201d and exhorted Americans to \u201coppose this oppression.\u201d (Related: LA Times columnist admits vaccine passports will \u2018single out\u2019 vaccine skeptics, \u2018break the resistance down\u2019.)\n\nVisit MedicalTyranny.com to read more about plans to implement COVID-19 vaccine passports and efforts against these.", "opengraph": {"title": "Florida governor bans vaccine passports, as they create TWO CLASSES of citizens", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2021-04-06-florida-governor-bans-vaccine-passports-citizen-discrimination.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "Florida Gov.
