They studied the changes in the behaviour of those vaccinated by comparing the week before and the week after the administering of the jab.\n\nThe report revealed that \u201cvarious robustness checks are undertaken by age, distance from home to vaccination point\u201d by the government group, which also studied \u201cgyration (radius of gyration on vaccination day), time (opening hours) and home (do they go home directly after vaccination)\u201d.\n\nThrough the behavioural monitoring of vaccinated people compared to a control group, the researchers were able to determine that \u201caverage pre-vaccination mobility increased by 218 meters\u201d.\n\nSilkie Carlo, the director of the civil liberties pressure group Big Brother Watch said in response to the report: \u201cNo one expects that by going to get a vaccine they will be tracked and monitored by their own Government.\n\n\u201cThis is deeply chilling and could be extremely damaging to public trust in medical confidentiality.\n\n\u201cBetween looming Covid passports and vaccine phone surveillance, this Government is turning Britain into a Big Brother state under the cover of Covid. This should be a wake-up call to us all.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "UK Vaccine Angst: Millions Secretly Surveilled After Taking Shot", "description": "Those who took the vaccine had the expectation that they were \"free\" from government scrutiny and could return to normal life; they were sorely disappointed as they now discover a clandestine surveillance effort to track their every move.", "url": "https://www.technocracy.news/uk-vaccine-angst-millions-secretly-surveilled-after-taking-shot/", "site_name": "Technocracy News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TechnocracyRising/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/Patwood", "article:section": "Police State", "image": "https://www.technocracy.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-7.42.19-AM.png", "image:secure_url": "https://www.technocracy.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-7.42.19-AM.png", "image:width": "850", "image:height": "536", "image:alt": "vaccine", "image:type": "image/png", "article:published_time": "2021-05-24T07:46:02-07:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://gab.com/compose?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fuk-vaccine-angst-millions-secretly-surveilled-after-taking-shot%2F&text=UK%20Vaccine%20Angst%3A%20Millions%20Secretly%20Surveilled%20After%20Taking%20Shot", "https://mewe.com/share?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fuk-vaccine-angst-millions-secretly-surveilled-after-taking-shot%2F", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=UK%20Vaccine%20Angst%3A%20Millions%20Secretly%20Surveilled%20After%20Taking%20Shot&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fuk-vaccine-angst-millions-secretly-surveilled-after-taking-shot%2F", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fuk-vaccine-angst-millions-secretly-surveilled-after-taking-shot%2F&text=UK%20Vaccine%20Angst%3A%20Millions%20Secretly%20Surveilled%20After%20Taking%20Shot", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fuk-vaccine-angst-millions-secretly-surveilled-after-taking-shot%2F&title=UK%20Vaccine%20Angst%3A%20Millions%20Secretly%20Surveilled%20After%20Taking%20Shot", "https://www.technocracy.news?print-my-blog=1&post-type=post&statuses%5B%5D=publish&rendering_wait=0&post_page_break=1&columns=1&font_size=normal&image_size=medium&links=include&show_site_title=1&show_site_tagline=1&show_site_url=1&show_date_printed=1&show_title=1&show_url=1&show_date=1&show_categories=1&show_featured_image=1&show_content=1&pmb_f=pdf&pmb-post=36529", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/05/22/millions-unwittingly-tracked-phone-vaccination-see-movements/", "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2021/05/24/uk-govt-tracked-millions-of-phones-to-study-movements-after-vaccine/", "https://www.technocracy.news/uk-miscarriages-rise-366-after-taking-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://www.technocracy.news/not-so-great-reset-live-in-a-box-dont-move-be-surveilled-shut-up-eat-bugs/", "https://www.technocracy.news/mercola-in-washington-dc-doctors-can-secretly-vaccinate-your-kids-without-your-knowledge-or-consent/", "https://www.technocracy.news/if-you-are-a-criminal-fbi-secretly-collected-your-cell-phone-gps-data/", "https://www.technocracy.news/japan-launches-official-investigation-into-millions-of-mrna-vaccine-deaths/", "https://www.technocracy.news/weaponizing-masks-to-force-children-into-taking-gene-therapy-shots/", "https://www.technocracy.news/first-test-of-immunity-passports-taking-place-today/", "https://www.technocracy.news/kicked-off-heart-transplant-list-for-not-taking-mrna-injection/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-05-24T07:46:02-07:00"}
