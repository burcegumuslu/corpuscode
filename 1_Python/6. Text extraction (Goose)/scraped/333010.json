After the necessary medical examinations, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was immediately treated. He is in good condition\u201d. So his spokesman Roberto Cuillo. According to what is learned Sassoli is still hospitalized. The president of the European Parliament is vaccinated against Covid-19 (with Pfizer) and in recent days he had tested negative for the swab. All the appointments in the diary are currently canceled.\n\nThe social network went crazy insinuating that it was not a simple pneumonia but a \u201cmasked\u201d case of Covid-19 in order not to reveal the much disputed ineffectiveness of the doses of Pfizer gene therapies that led various countries including the US and Italy to administer the third for the most vulnerable people and prompted Israel to consider the beginning of the fourth.\n\nAt the moment the official sources refer to a negative swab for Sassoli and therefore these allegations cannot be considered founded, even if the value of the PCR molecular swabs has been questioned by the American CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention) which ordered the forthcoming withdrawal of the authorization for the emergency use of Real-Time tests as they are considered unreliable and even unable to distinguish the SARS-Cov-2 virus from the flu viruses of the large Coronavirus family.\n\nThe health concerns of the European deputy of the Democratic Party come within hours of the mourning that has struck the world of Piedmontese culture. In fact, on Friday 17 September Piero Ghia, 74, president of the Asti d \u2018Appeal Award, died of contracting Covid, even though he had undergone the double vaccination. He had been hospitalized since 10 September in intensive care.\n\nIts fate is unfortunately similar to that of 676 people who died after the Pfizer vaccine (512 for Covid and 164 for Covid pneumonia) among those vaccinated in recent months in the European Union. To these are added 5,955 cases reported to the pharmacovigilance database of the EMA (European Medicines Agency) for having contracted Sars-Cov-2 symptomatically after the gene antiCovid with Comirnaty messenger RNA and whose course is unknown in EudraVigilance platform.\n\nWe cite by way of example the data on the Pfizer-Biontech GMO \u201cserum\u201d because they are the most relevant even if fatal outcomes were recorded even after Moderna, AstraZeneca and Jannsen as already highlighted in previous reports.\n\n\u201cThree years ago I reported to the undersecretary of the Minister of Health a study by the National Institute of Health, which showed that the incidence of severe pneumonia increased by 50% in those vaccinated with the flu. The study also reported 12% more mortality in vaccinated people, due to the enhancement of the disease \u00bb.\n\nA few months ago, Dr. Loretta Bolgan, a graduate in pharmaceutical chemistry and technology with a doctorate in pharmaceutical sciences and a research fellow at Massachussets General Hospital, stated a few months ago, about whom we have often spoken in investigations on the risks of Covid variants created by vaccine-resistance.\n\n\u201cIt may also be a coincidence, but various cities in which they anticipated the flu shot two months later became red zones. I brought the evidence three years ago, I reported the danger of potentiation of the disease and they did not consider it. Indeed, after two months they started with the vaccination campaign without taking this serious risk into account. As for the flu vaccine, also for the Covid vaccine, besides the known and potential risks, we do not know how long its action lasts \u201c, added the expert in an interview with on-line newspaper Affari Italiani.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/08/28/wuhan-gates-41-sars-2-is-a-bio-weapon-complaint-to-the-hague-court-with-montagnier-expertise-complaint-to-the-hague-court-with-montagnier-expertise-us-intelligence-spl/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/08/28/wuhan-gates-41-sars-2-is-a-bio-weapon-complaint-to-the-hague-court-with-montagnier-expertise-complaint-to-the-hague-court-with-montagnier-expertise-us-intelligence-spl/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2021/09/06/mattarella-vaccini-per-vita-normale-ma-dati-di-israele-lo-smentiscono-boom-di-contagi-e-15-morti-di-covid-in-5-giorni-dopo-3a-dose-si-pensa-alla-4a/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/07/25/breaking-us-cdc-retires-pcr-test-due-to-it-may-cant-distinguished-covid-from-influenza-viruses-pandemic-emergency-distorted/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/07/25/breaking-us-cdc-retires-pcr-test-due-to-it-may-cant-distinguished-covid-from-influenza-viruses-pandemic-emergency-distorted/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/07/11/covid-19-epsilon-californian-mutation-resists-to-vaccines-deltas-massacre-in-russia-as-sars-2-bio-weapons/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/07/11/covid-19-epsilon-californian-mutation-resists-to-vaccines-deltas-massacre-in-russia-as-sars-2-bio-weapons/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2021/09/20/tre-adolescenti-morti-dopo-i-vaccini-in-pochi-giorni-ma-pfizer-chiede-di-usarlo-anche-sui-bimbi-di-5-anni/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/02/14/with-covid-vaccines-risks-of-pulmonarys-serious-damnages-shocking-research-on-nature-journal-ignored-by-scientific-community-big-pharma-and-media/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/02/14/with-covid-vaccines-risks-of-pulmonarys-serious-damnages-shocking-research-on-nature-journal-ignored-by-scientific-community-big-pharma-and-media/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/06/10/wuhan-gates-39-sars-2-manmade-in-biolabs-with-gain-of-function-two-new-scientific-researches-accused-china-and-fauci-but-forgot-gates-biden-intrigues/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/06/22/bostons-research-even-funded-by-gates-reveals-unknown-and-dangerous-risks-in-m-rna-vaccine-already-explained-by-chinese-study/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/06/22/bostons-research-even-funded-by-gates-reveals-unknown-and-dangerous-risks-in-m-rna-vaccine-already-explained-by-chinese-study/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2021/07/21/vaccinare-in-pandemia-e-arma-di-distruzione-di-massa-sos-varianti-del-biologo-trinca-e-del-virologo-montagnier/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2021/07/21/vaccinare-in-pandemia-e-arma-di-distruzione-di-massa-sos-varianti-del-biologo-trinca-e-del-virologo-montagnier/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/06/04/covid-19-spike-toxin-inoculated-through-vaccines-scary-alert-by-canadian-immunologist/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/06/04/covid-19-spike-toxin-inoculated-through-vaccines-scary-alert-by-canadian-immunologist/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2021/09/21/sospetta-polmonite-per-il-vaccinato-sassoli-dopo-pfizer-1-414-decessi-per-malattie-respiratorie-in-ue-incubo-immunopatologia/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2021/09/21/sospetta-polmonite-per-il-vaccinato-sassoli-dopo-pfizer-1-414-decessi-per-malattie-respiratorie-in-ue-incubo-immunopatologia/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/06/15/eu-green-pass-under-skin-microchip-and-gates-666-mark-of-the-beast-transhumanist-plot-by-klaus-schwab-great-reset-nwo-against-christianity/", "http://www.gospanews.net/category/wuhan-gate/", "http://www.gospanews.net/category/investigazioni-dossier/corona-virus/", "https://www.rainews.it/archivio-rainews/articoli/Il-presidente-del-Parlamento-europeo-David-Sassoli-ricoverato-per-polmonite-fece80e6-d0e3-464e-a993-eb73243f4715.html", "https://www.la7.it/otto-e-mezzo/video/guido-rasi-ci-sono-casi-di-tampone-negativo-la-mattina-e-positivo-la-sera-lo-toglierei-dal-green-20-09-2021-397962", "https://www.adrreports.eu/it/search_subst.html#", "https://www.lunico.eu/vaccino-covid-loretta-bolgan/", "https://www.ilgazzettino.it/nordest/trieste/coronavirus_polmoni_danni_studio_cellule_anomale_proteina_spike-5565776.html", "https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/antiparasitic-drug-could-prevent-covid-19-lung-damage"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "September 21, 2021"}
