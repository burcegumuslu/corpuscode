The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had started filling up with numerous reports on side effects, from mild ones to such serious and life-threatening reactions as blood clotting, hemorrhages, unstoppable bleeding, heart issues, miscarriages, and deaths. While, arguably, not every single event was connected to the vaccine, the trend was truly alarming. In addition to that, the true numbers of adverse effects are likely much higher, since only about 10 percent of all cases are being reported to the system.\n\nAs the media and top officials turned a blind eye to the troubling reports, and Big Tech started to censor all stories of people suffering adverse reactions after being inoculated, many practicing doctors started to speak up and sound the alarm regarding the jabs\u2019 safety. No matter how renowned and prominent, all of them were called \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d and shut down from most of the public platforms.\n\nFurther, it turns out that the vaccines do not prevent one from getting the virus or transmitting it to others. After reports of breakthrough infections were already appearing on the web for at least a month, President Biden stated on July 21, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.\u201d\n\nOn July 31, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contradicted the president\u2019s words in a statement that the viral load vaccinated and unvaccinated people carry when infected is \u201csimilar.\u201d The vaccination was still recommended to everyone since it was said to reduce the risk of severe COVID complications.\n\nIn this confusing situation, both federal and some local governments, as well as private businesses, took the vaccination campaign on the offensive, and switched from cajoling people into getting jabbed to coercing them to do so \u2014 or face negative consequences, such as losing a job.\n\nStill, the mainstream media shames vaccine-hesitant Americans for not rolling up their sleeves. The latest target of the mainstream-media attack is people\u2019s independent research on vaccines.\n\n\u201cFour little words \u2014 \u2018do your own research\u2019 \u2014 are hurting the US pandemic response,\u201d warned CNN\u2019s Ramishah Maruf, citing chief media correspondent Brian Stelter.\n\nWhile admitting that \u201cit may seem like a reasonable, even positive, attitude,\u201d it is, at the same time, \u201ca favored talking point echoed by many in the right-wing media,\u201d Maruf claims. Presumably, it means that independent research is a tool that the conservative-leaning journalists encourage people to use in order to increase vaccine hesitancy and, therefore, undermine the whole vaccination campaign.\n\nOne may wonder, \u201cWhy would it hurt to watch this podcast with mRNA technology inventor Dr. Robert Malone? After all, he seems reputable enough to say something valuable about the jabs that employ technology that he pioneered.\u201d\n\nOne should not do such a thing, CNN explains, first of all, because most people are not smart enough to understand such an information: \u201cMost people simply don\u2019t know how to do their own research, especially when it comes to understanding the complexities of medical science.\u201d\n\nSecondly, in the current media environment, Maruf argues, people often fall victim to the \u201cmisleading data that confirms biases.\u201d And she is not wrong, actually. The media bias and political interest was on full display during the presidential campaign of 2020, when Maruf\u2019s own outlet admitted it was engaged in generating public panic over COVID only to hurt Donald Trump\u2019s chances for reelection. On a different occasion, many of the liberal outlets who rooted for Joe Biden stated they \u201cmade a mistake\u201d by dismissing the Wuhan lab-leak theory of COVID origin in 2020 because it was supported by Trump. Thus, if the media environment is not a place to look for reliable information, it is because of CNN and its ilk.\n\nMaruf quotes Renee DiResta, research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, who laments, \u201cNobody\u2019s going to the library and looking up authoritative sources to do their own research.\u201d But what if they do? See point number 1 and get a medical degree.\n\nMaruf then quotes Yael Eisenstat, a Future of Democracy fellow at the Berggruen Institute, saying that the media \u201cneeds to be more transparent in its reporting, especially when it comes to Covid.\u201d This is because, Maruf claims, there are \u201csubtle differences between understanding scientific research that is still theoretical versus that which has been tested and widely agreed upon.\u201d DiResta adds that \u201cScience is a consensus building process.\u201d\n\nThe latter statement implies that if the \u201cscientists\u201d (or whoever talk on behalf of \u201cscience\u201d and are called \u201cexperts\u201d on TV) agree that the vaccines are safe, then it must be true. The evidence may change, and if the \u201cscientists\u201d chose to agree on something else, then the previous statement becomes invalid.\n\nThis type of logic is painfully reminiscent of George Orwell\u2019s 1984, where the Party could announce that Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia and allied with East Asia, only to later announce that Oceania had always been at war with East Asia and allied with Eurasia, and the people were expected to believe both claims. In the same vein, the Party could also claim that two plus two equals five, and it would be so, because in that dystopian world, the reality was internal and did not rely on physical evidence. It only existed in the mind of the rulers, who projected it onto the public: \u201cWhatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth.\u201d\n\nThat is the type of reality the corporate media and their masters are pushing on America. So please, do your own research and see for yourself that 2+2=4.\n\nRead more at: TheNewAmerican.com and VaccineWars.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "CNN: Do NOT \u201cdo your own research\u201d on COVID vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2021-09-28-do-not-do-your-own-research-says-cnn.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "\u201cVaccines save lives.\u201d \u201cVaccines are safe and effective.\u201d \u201cVaccines will get us back to normal.\u201d \u201cAll eligible Americans must take a vaccine.\u201d Americans have been bombarded with this mantra 24/7 since the experimental gene therapeutics, aka \u201cCOVID vaccines,\u201d became available to the general public in April of this year.
