So, from an overall health and spiritual point of view, this being our third eye, we want it functioning properly at it\u2019s full capacity.\n\nIts important to understand that the pineal and pituitary gland work together to create the third eye phenomenon. (one positive charge one negative charge)\n\nThe Pineal gland produces melatonin, a hormone that affects the modulation of your wake/sleep patterns and seasonal functions in the body. Melatonin has various functions in the central nervous system. The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system in our body.\n\nThe pituitary gland and our pineal gland, control our endocrine system. The endocrine system is the collection of glands that produce hormones that regulate metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sexual function, reproduction, sleep, and mood, among other things. Which is why our third eye is being attacked daily by chemicals in the air, in our drinking water, vegetables, fruits, toothpaste, soft drinks, and GMO foods. Even if the food is organic it is being watered with fluoridated contaminated water.\n\nFluoride is a Halide and is part of a family of chemicals. These chemicals and frequency blockers are identified as sodium fluoride in our water, Together with aluminum, and mercury in vaccines, daily spraying in our atmosphere, with barium which becomes radioactive, vaporized aluminum, which is proven to be a frequency blocker, radiation, fluorine, chlorine, pesticides, bromine, bromide chemicals, air pollution, (chemtrails) and other various household products, which are all mimickers of iodine or frequency blockers that effect our bodies from evolving to higher states of health and consciousness. In combination with the Common Core Curriculum are indeed dumbing down the human species.\n\nFluoride is added to our drinking water in various countries and cities, such as Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and especially in the North and South Americas.\n\nIt is a neurotoxin industrial by-product and waste product that is toxic to the human body.\n\nDepending on the weight and size, the average human male adult is around 70% water and the average adult female body is around 42% water. Imagine how much better our bodies would function with pure water that is toxic Free.\n\nFluoride has been falsely advertised that it helps strengthen teeth, but current studies show that\u2019s not the case at all, and in fact will actually cause damage to your teeth, and as mentioned already, is deactivating our pineal gland, our third eye, and is causing calcification. Making us 3rd eye blind.\n\nI believe and many others, that this is used to dumb down the majority of the masses and keeps us from reaching our highest potential as humans.\n\nThese chemicals cause calcification within the pineal gland, which can be seen on x-rays, and ultrasound scans.\n\nDepending on the individual, some x-ray images shows the pineal gland covered with deposits and is harden because it is calcified.\n\nObviously, this is causing damage to our third eye, the pineal gland, and needs to be removed in order to get it functioning properly again.\n\nIn the late 90\u2019s, a scientist by the name of Jennifer Luke carried out the first study of the effects of sodium fluoride on the pineal gland. She determined that the pineal gland, located in the middle of the brain, was a target for fluoride.\n\nThe pineal gland simply absorbed more fluoride than any other physical matter in the body, even bones, and as mentioned earlier this calcifies the pineal gland and makes it no longer effective in balancing the entire hormonal processes through the body.\n\nWhat are Calcification Deposits and how to get rid of them\n\nCalcification is the accumulation of calcium salts in a body tissue. It normally occurs in the formation of bone, but calcium can be deposited abnormally in soft tissue, causing it to harden.\n\nHealthy levels of iodine help detoxify the body of these toxic halide mimickers, in addition to purging the body of heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium and aluminum, along with a proper diet, assist our cells in the uptake of proper nutrients and minerals.\n\nIodine is used by every organ and tissue in the body. It is absolutely necessary for healthy cognitive abilities, thyroid as well as healthy ovaries, breasts and prostate. These are just a few of the reasons to become interested in iodine.\n\nIodine also protects the body from radiation frequencies, thanks to the new cell tower grid system, which communicate with all our Wi-Fi electronics, like cell phones. lap tops, iPads, game consoles, smart meters.\n\nBelgium in 2016 issued iodine pills to all its citizens in a nuclear emergency plan.\n\nIodine should be taken as a daily supplement which is lacking from all our diets and executed deliberately as it was taken out of our food supply in 1946 after WW2 and replaced with Bromine. During this period is also when they implemented fluoride in your water supplies.\n\nWe need many substances for health, and none do more for us than iodine. Traditionally sourced from the sea, iodine is required by the body for a number of functions.\n\nIodine is also instrumental in brain development, with an inadequate amount actually leading to the most avoidable form of mental retardation known as iodine deficiency-related retardation.\n\nIodine plays a HUGE roll in decalcification and raising your awareness/consciousness\u2026 Its alchemy of the body.\n\nYou can get a high-quality bottle of Iodine at maggiesholisticsny.com.\n\nI use it and it works great. Or you can pick some up in a health store near you.\n\nSunshine or UV light really helps regulate melatonin levels and activate the pineal gland. This also helps you with energy, vitamin D, and with feeling better about yourself overall. Notice how people are in a much better mood when it is sunny outside.\n\nSungazing during the right times of the day, in the morning when the sun rises, and later when the sun sets can also help activate the pineal gland.\n\nThe regular water filters you buy in the store does not take the fluoride out of your water. The best thing you can do to eliminate fluoride from your water, is to buy bottled water, but make sure to read the ingredients to make sure that there is No fluoride added.\n\nYou can also buy a reverse osmosis water filter, or water distillation for your home. I believe they also have these machines in most supermarkets that you can use.\n\nGetting a good amount of exercise, and having a healthy diet overall, eating as much organic foods as you can, and of course I highly recommend working on becoming a vegan for many good reasons that we already know.\n\nMaking these changes in your life will increase your chances of avoiding these toxic chemicals.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t want you to know!\n\nSalt is a conductor of electricity. Calcification is causing accumulation of calcium salts in the pineal glad. In theory, this could possibly be a way of controlling our subconscious mind or as we know already, is blocking the usage of our 3rd eye, which leads to health effects in the thyroid, breasts, ovaries, testicles, adrenal glands, and pancreas.\n\nIt can be explained by the fact that when you put salt into water, salt molecules Na Cl divide themselves into ions: Na+ and Cl-. As they carry an electrical charge, they are put in motion by the electrical field created by the generator (a battery for example), thus a current can flow in salted water and it is proven that salted water conducts electricity.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing in metals for electrons, which carry a negative charge. The more salt you put into the water, the better it conducts electricity.\n\nThe human Pineal Gland or the third eye can be activated to the spiritual world frequencies and enables you to have the sense of your all knowing, godlike euphoria, or your higher self and oneness all around you.\n\nOur pineal gland, once tuned into it\u2019s proper frequencies, with the help of meditation, yoga, plenty of sunshine, or various other esoteric methods, enables a person to travel into other dimensions, known as astral travel or astral projection or remote viewing.\n\nThe Pineal Gland is depicted as a pinecone in ancient sculptures, and in art found in places like Tibet, Egypt, and Rome.These ancient societies knew the benefits and exemplified this in their vast symbology\u2019s with a symbol of an eye, or a marking on there forehead as seen in India.\n\nI believe that if you take away the seat of the soul, this disconnects our oneness with god and power of our source.\n\nThe Pineal gland or the \u201cseat of the soul\u201d is where high consciousness can be developed. This means that by detoxification and decalcification of the body, will make us reach our consciousness to a higher level to perceive other dimensions and open new doors to explore the endless possibilities of the universe.\n\nIt is not to late to change your diet for you to be able to detoxify and to decalcify your pineal gland.\n\nThe present situation we find ourselves in demands that we quickly re-engineer not only mainstream allopathic medicine but all branches and alternatives.\n\nRemember, knowledge is power and applied knowledge is freedom.\n\nThe sources for this article include:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Secrets They Don\u2019t want You to Know - How to Decalcify Your Pituitary Gland and PINEAL Gland, our 3rd Eye", "description": "The Secrets They Don\u2019t want You to Know - How to Decalcify Your Pituitary Gland and PINEAL Gland, our 3rd Eye -", "url": "https://369news.net/2018/04/29/decalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye/", "site_name": "369news.net", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/369UNIVERSE/", "article:tag": "toxic chemicals", "article:section": "HEALTH", "updated_time": "2020-01-12T19:06:23+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/369news.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/How-to-Decalcify-Your-Pituitary-Gland-and-PINEAL-Gland-our-3rd-Eye-g-e1525007251982.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/369news.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/How-to-Decalcify-Your-Pituitary-Gland-and-PINEAL-Gland-our-3rd-Eye-g-e1525007251982.jpg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "477", "image:alt": "The Secrets They Don\u2019t want You to Know - How to Decalcify Your Pituitary Gland and PINEAL Gland, our 3rd Eye", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2018-04-29T13:21:39+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-01-12T19:06:23+00:00"}, "tags": ["Activating Our Pineal Gland", "Calcification", "eye of Ra", "remote viewing", "detoxify the body", "iodine deficiency", "Pinecone in Ancient Cultures", "pineal gland", "seat of the soul", "astral projection", "astral travel", "pituitary gland", "third eye", "salted water conducts electricity", "toxic", "our third eye", "3rd eye", "higher self", "toxic chemicals", "Health", "sodium fluoride", "eye of Horus", "Hidden Knowledge", "fluoride", "Activating Our third eye", "Calcification Deposits", "Halides"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "640", "height": "360", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hbQlUEvK07g?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hbQlUEvK07g?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent"}], "links": ["https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2F369news.net%2F2018%2F04%2F29%2Fdecalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye%2F&linkname=The%20Secrets%20They%20Don%E2%80%99t%20want%20You%20to%20Know%20%E2%80%93%20How%20to%20Decalcify%20Your%20Pituitary%20Gland%20and%20PINEAL%20Gland%2C%20our%203rd%20Eye", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2F369news.net%2F2018%2F04%2F29%2Fdecalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye%2F&linkname=The%20Secrets%20They%20Don%E2%80%99t%20want%20You%20to%20Know%20%E2%80%93%20How%20to%20Decalcify%20Your%20Pituitary%20Gland%20and%20PINEAL%20Gland%2C%20our%203rd%20Eye", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://www.maggiesholisticsny.com/", "https://369news.net/2018/04/29/decalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye/?share=telegram", "https://369news.net/2018/04/29/decalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye/?share=facebook", "https://369news.net/2018/04/29/decalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye/?share=twitter", "https://369news.net/2018/04/29/decalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye/?share=pinterest", "https://369news.net/2018/04/29/decalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye/?share=reddit", "https://369news.net/2018/04/29/decalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20The%20Secrets%20They%20Don%E2%80%99t%20want%20You%20to%20Know%20-%20How%20to%20Decalcify%20Your%20Pituitary%20Gland%20and%20PINEAL%20Gland%2C%20our%203rd%20Eye&body=https%3A%2F%2F369news.net%2F2018%2F04%2F29%2Fdecalcify-your-pituitary-gland-pineal-gland-our-3rd-eye%2F&share=email", "https://369news.net/2018/04/24/ancient-hidden-knowledge-halos-represent/", "https://369news.net/2018/05/11/why-men-with-dark-intentions-destroyed-the-library-of-alexandria/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-04-29T13:21:39+00:00"}
