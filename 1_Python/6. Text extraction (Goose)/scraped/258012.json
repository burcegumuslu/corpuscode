Together, let\u2019s keep working to make Canada more inclusive.\u201d\n\nWow, you can tell how desperate he is by the fact that he threw the entire kitchen sink of the left\u2019s white supremacy pejoratives at his critics. Usually, they try to parcel out the groundless accusations, but Trudeau is so panicky that he hurled all his worn-out \u201cisms\u201d to see if any of them would stick.\n\nFYI: they didn\u2019t. In fact, take a look at photos of Canada\u2019s truckers and protesters. You\u2019ll note that they\u2019re unlikely \u201cwhite supremacists,\u201d since most of them are Sikh immigrants from India.\n\nSikhs, who represent major share of truckers, protest against Canada\u2019s vaccine mandates as Trudeau and his family leave their Ottawa home\n\nAlso from that article: \u201cThe increasing number of protesters prompted police to prepare for the possibility of violence. As of now, no injuries or deaths have been reported.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s what an actual \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d looks like. You don\u2019t have to overlook any widespread arson to qualify it as \u201cmostly peaceful.\u201d\n\nThe only way Trudeau is making Canada more inclusive is that he\u2019s bringing so many people together to support the truckers and reject his vacuous woke nonsense.\n\nThe good news is that while Trudeau obviously fails to get the message, others can sense which way the wind is blowing, and it\u2019s blowing away from governments seizing more power and trampling on people\u2019s rights with destructive \u201chealth emergency\u201d measures that aren\u2019t even helping. The premier of Saskatchewan wrote a letter of support for the truckers and set a target date of this month to end vaccination requirements, saying they\u2019re no longer reducing transmission of the Omicron variant. And Quebec\u2019s premier, surprised by the huge public backlash, dropped his plans to tax the unvaccinated.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just in Canada: freedom is breaking out all over as public backlash has grown against harsh COVID restrictions that have done little or nothing to reduce COVID deaths.\n\nDenmark becomes first EU country to lift all Covid-19 restrictions\n\nWatching Trudeau spew all those empty \u201cisms\u201d and seeing that they no longer intimidate people into silence is one of the best pieces of news that Western civilization has seen in years. If for nothing else, those Canadian truckers have earned a big salute from everyone who cares about freedom of thought and speech, limited government and the rights of the individual.\n\nFinally, some perfect illustrations of what I hope is the last gasp of mindless, unscientific COVID compliance theater by our hypocritical elites, check out this photo courtesy of the Gun Free Zone blog.\n\nOne picture that captures the utter insanity of COVID compliance\n\nIt\u2019s a group of professional cheerleaders posing with basketball legend Magic Johnson. The young gymnasts in peak physical condition (a group at lowest risk from COVID) are all wearing masks. The only one not wearing a mask is the rich and famous 62-year-old overweight retiree who\u2019s had HIV for 31 years.\n\nMagic also wasn\u2019t wearing a mask in these photos with COVID lockdown fanatics, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, San Francisco Mayor London Breed and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. But then, neither were any of them.\n\nAt least Garcetti had an excuse: he held his breath for two seconds. Take that, virus!\n\nThis article may contain statements that reflect the opinion of the author. Consider sharing this article with your friends and family.
