Richard Pan has temporarily put on hold a proposal to make Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations mandatory for schoolchildren.\n\nThe Democratic state lawmaker announced the move in an April 14 press release posted on his website. Pan first introduced Senate Bill (SB) 871, which sought to require COVID-19 vaccines for children from kinder to twelfth grade in the Golden State, in January.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, COVID vaccination rates \u2013 particularly among children \u2013 are currently insufficient. [The] state needs to focus its [efforts] on increasing access to COVID vaccinations for children through physicians and other health providers who care for children and \u2026 [giving] families accurate information about the COVID vaccine. Until children\u2019s access to COVID vaccination is greatly improved, I believe that a statewide policy to require COVID vaccination in schools is not the immediate priority,\u201d said Pan.\n\nEdwin Kirby, spokesman for the state senator, echoed Pan\u2019s sentiment regarding children\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cGiven that the state\u2019s vaccination rate among five- to 11-year-olds is at 34 percent, essentially, it doesn\u2019t make sense until we deal with these access issues for the younger kids to move forward with the bill,\u201d he told the Daily Californian. \u201cWe thought there would be a lot more uptake, frankly, of the [COVID-19] vaccine as well by this point.\u201d\n\nPan first introduced SB 871 to the California State Legislature on Jan. 24. The proposal indicated that any student who wishes to enroll in either a private or public elementary or secondary school must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to their admission. (Related: California legislators, including Richard Pan, trying to force all schoolchildren to get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for covid.)\n\nChildren shouldn\u2019t get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine to begin with\n\nPan defended the benefits of vaccinating children against COVID-19 in his April 14 statement, describing vaccination as \u201cthe cornerstone of safer schools and neighborhoods.\u201d He claimed that the COVID-19 shots \u201chave proved safe and effective in reducing the risk of hospitalizations and death from COVID,\u201d \u201cdecreased infection rates and transmission\u201d and \u201clowered rates of post-COVID symptoms.\u201d\n\nHowever, a former Trump administration official denounced COVID-19 vaccination for children \u2013 which the California state senator is advocating.\n\nWriting for the Brownstone Institute, Dr. Paul Elias Alexander called on Pfizer to \u201cleave the children alone\u201d in an October 2021 piece. He denounced the vaccine maker\u2019s plan to obtain approval for injecting children aged five to 12 as \u201cabsolutely reckless, dangerous \u2026 and without any scientific basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe published evidence is conclusive that the risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 in children is almost nil. It is clear that children are at very low risk of spreading the infection to other children [and] adults, taking it home, becoming ill, or dying,\u201d wrote Alexander.\n\nThe former scientific advisor at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) cited a report by researchers from Johns Hopkins University that looked at a group of 48,000 children infected with COVID-19. They found no COVID fatalities in the group, and further analysis found \u201ca mortality rate of zero among children without a pre-existing medical condition such as leukemia.\u201d\n\nDr. Marty Makary, the team\u2019s head researcher, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that their findings have \u201csignificant implications\u201d for healthy children and whether they need to be injected with two COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\n\u201cThere is very little risk and no data or evidence to justify any of the COVID-19 injections in children. Under no circumstance should we expose the risk of the injections to children. To consider putting risk on children so as to protect adults is perverse, reckless and very dangerous,\u201d the former HHS advisor concluded.\n\nVaccines.news has more stories about politicians who want to mandate COVID-19 shots for children.\n\nWatch Richard Pan below explaining to the Sacramento Bee why a bill for mandatory vaccination is a must.\n\nThis video is from the Vaccines and Vaccination channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCalifornian Senator Richard Pan pushing to outlaw parental rights in all medical decisions.\n\nSenator Richard Pan is pushing a bill that would make it a \u201ccrime\u201d for anyone to question vaccines.\n\nRichard Pan says Americans who refuse experimental coronavirus gene therapy injections are \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d\n\nMedical authoritarian Dr. Richard Pan believes government of California controls all medical choices for parents and their children, including forced vaccination.", "opengraph": {"title": "California State Sen.
