Virtually no thinking person anywhere on planet Earth would dispute that the Pandemic has been politicized and used to alter the 2020 election process and outcome. Covid responses have also reshaped everyday life and the economy on a global scale.\n\nSo who is coordinating it? Who has taken the lead in developing the initiatives, the narratives, and the media for the Pandemic Industrial Complex? What funding is behind it and who composes the \u201cCovid Pandemic Brain Trust\u201d?\n\nHERE IS THE ANSWER \u2013 OR AT LEAST ONE MAJOR ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORT.\n\nWe will look in this article at the organization called the \u201cCovid Collaborative\u201d and its initiatives, leadership, funding and programs. Little commentary is needed in this brief overview of the organization and the efforts it is coordinating on a daily basis. These decisions impact all our lives while it is highly likely we did not even know the organization existed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve assembled a diverse and comprehensive team of experts, leaders and institutions in health, education, and the economy representing the diversity of the country to shape the work of the COVID Collaborative, develop consensus recommendations, and engage with local, state and national leaders \u2013 ensuring that our efforts are truly from the nation, for the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany institutions of higher education are taking steps to maximize vaccinations and implement risk mitigation within their communities in order to become \"COVIDSafeZones.\"\n\n\u201c #TurnThePage Project is about writing the next chapter in education, together. COVID-19 pushed a system with persistent opportunity gaps deeper into crisis, with our most disadvantaged students facing the greatest challenges. To ensure this is a moment of reinvention for our schools, for our teachers, and for our students, we must listen to and elevate transformative people, perspectives, programs, and policies.\u201d\n\nThe Walton Family Foundation is, at its core, a family-led foundation. Three generations of the descendants of our founders, Sam and Helen Walton, and their spouses, work together to lead the foundation and create access to opportunity for people and communities. We work in three areas: improving K-12 education, protecting rivers and oceans and the communities they support, and investing in our home region of Northwest Arkansas and the Arkansas-Mississippi Delta.\n\nMORE ON THE COVID COLLABORATIVE EDUCATION INIATIVES\n\n\u201cAPRIL 28, 2021, Washington, D.C. | An independent task force published resources today to support schools and districts in implementing CDC guidance and getting students and staff safely back for in-person learning. The resources, which come as schools across the country are reopening or preparing for reopening in the fall, are designed to help integrate effective infection prevention and control measures in schools, which can keep transmission of COVID-19 near zero, even with community spread.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe task force was convened by the COVID Collaborative, Harvard\u2019s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, Brown School of Public Health, and New America, and brings together representatives from across health and education, from associations representing teachers, principals and superintendents, to public health institutions and professional associations. The initiative was launched shortly after President Biden set a target to reopen a majority of schools by May 1 with the goal of supporting schools as they reopened in-person learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese materials, developed by Chiefs for Change with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, can help districts design and implement a testing program inside schools.\u201d\n\nTHE MASSIVE AD CAMPAIGN FOR VACCINE EDUCATION\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Education Initiative by the Ad Council and COVID Collaborative\n\n\u201cThe Ad Council and COVID Collaborative have partnered to educate the American public and build confidence around the COVID-19 vaccines, as part of one of the largest public health education campaigns in history.\u201d\n\nIF YOUR COMPANY IS INTERESTED IN BECOMING A #COVIDSAFEZONE, PLEASE CONTACT COVIDSAFEZONES@COVIDCOLLABORATIVE.US\n\nThe United States sits at a critical juncture in our efforts to move beyond the pandemic. We are seeking your help. More than 164 million Americans \u2013 representing 58 percent of the eligible population \u2013 have been fully vaccinated, providing substantial protection against illness, reducing deaths, lessening the burden on hospitals, and reducing missed workdays and closures. Increasing vaccination rates is the country\u2019s most immediate and best hope of reaching population immunity, beating the pandemic, and restoring our national vitality and way of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe #COVIDSafeZones recommendations are not a broad vaccination mandate. We believe they are consistent with established precedent and any state laws that prohibit broad vaccination requirements in places of business. \u201c\n\n\u201cThese recommendations are temporary measures until we are reliably back to low COVID rates and the public health threat is behind us. The recommendations can be combined with other steps such as improved ventilation and distancing. \u201c\n\nNew tool shows more than 50 percent of the population is vaccine-hesitant in over 580 ZIP codes across the US\n\n\u201cCOVID Collaborative, Health Action Alliance, and partners representing rural America hosted a National Business Summit on engaging employees and residents in rural areas and small cities, offering case studies, best practices and actionable tools for employers and other leaders.

The letter was endorsed by a number of renowned global health experts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter highlights that today\u2019s global vaccine gap is not just a supply problem, but also a massive distribution and delivery challenge. To this end, we call on G7 leaders to take action in five areas:\u201d\n\n\u201cRay Chambers- Ray Chambers is a philanthropist and humanitarian who has directed most of his efforts towards helping children.

So Wheaton and the Billy Graham Center on its campus are signed on for the long haul with the Global Pandemic Industry.\n\nBy the way- the true church of Jesus Christ sould NEVER be in bed with this collaborative of progressives and operatives of the left. Nor should anyone who professes to know the true hope the Gospel offers the world. They are simply incompatible -a mixture of light and darkness with no one to raise a banner of truth among them.\n\nIt is likely the Pandemic Industrial Complex is never going away. Americans and people all over the world looked for a vaccine which would allow life to return to normal. Once that vaccine arrived and the shots were being administered the public was informed that two of the three options would require two shots and now perhaps a third booster and then annual boosters. The narrative changes with each passing day. Now people everywhere are facing vaccine mandates to continue to hold their jobs, to travel, to be admitted onto campuses and into sporting events.\n\nThe willingness and even zealous attempts to coordinate the suppression of information or simple concerns on personal social media pages have only heightened suspicion and doubt in the narrative. A politically charged public health response to a global pandemic and vaccine which ignores, denies, and even persecutes medical professionals who dispute the science or lack thereof should remain suspect. Thinking people the world over have taken to the streets in protest of lockdowns, mask mandates and now vaccine mandates. The cry for governments to recognize the privacy and rights of individuals and to be heard with their concerns validated by realities all around them seems lost to the sheer force of the money \u2013 the political players- career \u201cpublic servants\u201d and the determined efforts to own the crisis and its responses by organizations like the \u201cCOVID COLLABORATIVE\u201d. Come variants or high water the organizations who feed from the progressive machine look to continue to cash in and steam roll humanity in the process of \u201csaving\u201d it.\n\nPlease go to Mypillow.com and use the promo code WVW to save up to 66% off and Mike Lindell will give a generous percentage back to WVW-TV to support our free broadcasts.\n\nYour Tax Deductible Support at www.wvwfoundation.com Helps Us Cover Our Huge Streaming Bill So You and Millions of Americans Can Watch Our TV Shows For Free.
