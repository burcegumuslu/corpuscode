Since he was to compete in a national rowing regatta in a few days, he thought it was wise to get tested for COVID at a nearby clinic, where he tested positive.\n\nI hadn\u2019t been feeling quite normal myself for several days, but hadn\u2019t been concerned at all. When my husband described his symptoms, however, I could have ticked off almost all of them in relation to my own. He was then sure that I had COVID, too, and we knew we needed to isolate ourselves in our condo. My husband canceled his plans to participate in the regatta.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://sentinel.christianscience.com/bundles/mugosentineldigital/images/sentinel_share_logo.png", "title": "Persistence brings complete healing of COVID / Christian Science Sentinel", "site_name": "Christian Science Sentinel", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "Mon May 23 00:00:00 2022", "article:modified_time": "Wed May  4 13:22:18 2022", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/JSH-Online/298116873586922", "url": "https://sentinel.christianscience.com/issues/2022/5/124-21/persistence-brings-complete-healing-of-covid", "description": "I was so grateful for the assurance that because God loves and cares for each one of us as His child, I was naturally immune to this or any virus."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Mon May 23 00:00:00 2022"}
