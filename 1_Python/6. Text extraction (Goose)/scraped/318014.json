A diverse, multi-disciplined group from both Europe and the U.S. recently raised questions about COVID-19 vaccination in children. About 42.5 million recorded COVID-19 cases in America have led to the highest number of deaths worldwide: approximately 681,222 deaths, according to&nbsp;Johns Hopkins University. With their findings published in the journal&nbsp;Toxicology Reports,&nbsp;the researchers first clarify that the bulk of the official COVID-19-attributed deaths per capita occur in the elderly with high comorbidities, while the COVID-19 attributed deaths per capita in children are negligible. The paper\u2019s authors write that the great majority of \u201cnormalized post-inoculation\u201d deaths occur in the elderly with high comorbidities, while \u201cnormalized post-inoculation\u201d deaths in kids are small but not negligible. A provocative piece given the dominant societal narrative at this point in time, the authors\u2019 data crunching leads to what undoubtedly is a claim rejected by much of the academic medical establishment, which is that COVID-19 vaccination leads to a five-fold increase in deaths in the most vulnerable age (65 and above) demographic. Therefore, the risk-benefit ratio of the mass vaccination program for children must be thoroughly vetted. While most may disagree with these research findings, what if they are correct\u2026, or even just partly correct?\n\n\n"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
