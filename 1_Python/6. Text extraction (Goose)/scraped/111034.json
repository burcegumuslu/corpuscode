In the course of the remarkable conversation, Lauterbach was confronted with and forced to disavow his earlier claims from 2021 that the vaccines are \u201cside-effect free\u201d; recognised that every injury is one injury too many and called these cases \u201cdismaying\u201d; likened the so-called \u201cpost-vaccination syndrome\u201d (Post-Vac) to Long Covid; emphasised that he wasn\u2019t responsible for negotiating the contracts which exclude pharmaceuticals from liability; and twice called pharmaceutical company profits \u201cexorbitant,\u201d agreeing that these firms should fund an institute to help those those who have been injured by their products.\n\nBecause the interview will be selectively clipped, I provide this full translation:\n\nChristian Sievers of the ZDF Heute Journal (henceforth S): The Federal Minister of Health is with us. Many thanks and good evening, Mr Lauterbach.\n\nS: What do you say to those who have been affected [by vaccine injuries]?\n\nL: First of all, what\u2019s happened to these people is absolutely dismaying, and every single case is one too many. I honestly feel very sorry for these people. There are severe disabilities, and some of them will be permanent. So it\u2019s hard. What we do as a state is that the health insurance companies pay the treatment costs, and, well, the federal states bear the support costs, if support is necessary. But in fact we have problems on both sides, because we don\u2019t yet have the drugs for treating them. These are being feverishly researched. The entitlement to benefits is also often very bureaucratically tied-up. So I really do understand the people who are complaining here.\n\nS : Now you\u2019re making it sound like everything is settled. But when you talk to these people, you hear exactly the opposite. A year of fighting, being turned away again and again \u2013 many officials simply don\u2019t believe them, sometimes they never get an answer at all, and then after running the gauntlet to get their vaccine injuries recognised, all they receive is a small sum. That can\u2019t be all the state has to offer these people right now, can it?\n\nL: Absolutely not, and I don\u2019t want to give that impression, because that\u2019s not how I see things. These cases must be more quickly recognised, these vaccine injuries, and we\u2019re now slowly getting a clearer picture. But I should also point out, just so I don\u2019t leave a false impression: severe vaccine injuries happen in less than 1 in 10,000 vaccinations, according to the Paul Ehrlich Institute or the European licensing authorities. So it\u2019s not that common. But because our understanding of these injuries is getting clearer and clearer, it should also be possible in future to identify those who are affected more quickly, so that we can get them quicker help.\n\nS: Why did you, Mr Lauterbach, still claim in the summer of 2021 that the vaccines had no side effects?\n\nL: Well, that was an exaggeration that I once made in a misguided tweet. But it wasn\u2019t fundamentally my position. I had already commented very, very often on the side effects of vaccinations. For example, I \u2026\n\nS: But you often said afterwards that there were hardly any or practically no [side effects. You said this again on the [television talkshow] Anne Will. So, you\u2019ve always given the impression that side effects aren\u2019t really an issue at all.\n\nL: Well, that\u2019s not right, as I just said. I was aware of the figures at the time, and they\u2019ve remained relatively stable. These vaccines have been used worldwide, 1 in 10,000 [are injured], so you can say it\u2019s a lot, or you can say it\u2019s not so many. But the vaccine really does protect against serious illness and, by the way, very often also reduces the risk of Long Covid. This is similar to what we\u2019re talking about here, with the Post-Vac syndrome, so the vaccinations \u2013 there\u2019s an outweighing benefit, but it\u2019s true, 1 in 10,000 is the frequency of serious side effects.\n\nS: Now the first lawsuits are pending against BioNTech, and also against other vaccine manufacturers. What do you think that\u2019ll go?\n\nL: I can\u2019t speculate, that\u2019s not my job. As minister I have to be careful. It\u2019s true that within the framework of these EU contracts, the companies were largely exempted from liability and that the liability therefore lies with the German state, so to speak, as just described, with the federal states \u2026 but the most important thing is, looking ahead, we need treatments, and I\u2019ll therefore set up a programme with the Ministry of Health, where we\u2019ll investigate the consequences of Long Covid, and also Post-Vac syndrome, where we\u2019ll look into this and improve care. That\u2019s a contribution we can make.\n\nS: When will this happen, in concrete terms? It\u2019s precisely these affected people who are suffering all these delays, who want to know.\n\nL: That\u2019s true, but I\u2019m negotiating with the budget committee, and indeed it\u2019s a programme I\u2019d like to launch as soon as possible, and I\u2019m in budget negotiations for this money. So it\u2019s something that we also have to bring to fruition, it\u2019s an obligation, and it would network the experts in this field in such a way that the probability of good therapy in Germany would grow.\n\nS: Now, you just mentioned the liability waiver for pharmaceutical companies. It means that the pharmaceuticals can, so to speak, relax in all these lawsuits, because the state has assumed the risk. So it\u2019s the state \u2013 that is, you, the federal government \u2013 that has to answer for any damages claims that may arise. Does you feel good about that?\n\nL: What does feeling good mean? First of all, I didn\u2019t negotiate the contracts; as far as my office is concerned, I inherited them, and I believe that it was due to the situation at that time that people wanted to get the vaccines as quickly as possible, and so the state assumed liability. Maybe that was the right thing to do, because it\u2019s better for the state to be liable than to have to go through long settlements or lawsuits with companies.\n\nS: But we\u2019ve just seen how difficult it is to actually get money from the state. What do you think will happen now? Do you think that in view of the situation, for example, pharmaceuticals could voluntarily put money into a foundation? Would that be an idea if they don\u2019t have any liability?\n\nL: It would definitely be a good idea if companies would show a willingness to help out here, because the profits have been exorbitant \u2013 exorbitant profits. So that wouldn\u2019t just be a good gesture, we should expect it. But you ask me, what will happen next? I\u2019d say the optimistic scenario is that we finally learn how to deal with Long Covid and Post-Vac, how we can manage that, and that we moreover recognise cases faster so that people don\u2019t have to wait so long to be recognised as having Post-Vac syndrome in the first place.\n\nS: That\u2019s a promise from the Federal Minister of Health, Karl Lauterbach.
