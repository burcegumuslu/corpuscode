Out of the hundreds of articles and videos I read and view every week, I will assemble a list of some of the best for everyone on our mailing list. I hope you find them useful and I welcome your comments below.\n\nWhat is \u201cThriveConnect?\u201d It\u2019s a cosmic dating service between breakthrough innovations and the funding and support they need to get safely and successfully out to the world. Kimberly will no longer be engaged in social media, blogs and other outreach in order to work with a few of these projects to create the model that we can then apply to all the others. (We have been contacted by over 1,000 inventors and innovators from around the world who are working on technical, environmental, social and economic breakthroughs.)\n\nTo give us the time we need, we are suspending the ThriveTogether think tank on-line events for now. I will still be offering blogs, Facebook posts and these curated article collections as time allows while consulting on ThriveConnect and writing my book about how restoring the wholeness of natural systems and the liberty perspective are combining to solve virtually every issue in the way of humanity thriving.\n\nThanks in advance for your understanding and your ongoing alliance in our shared quest for peace, prosperity and justice on our treasured planet and beyond.", "opengraph": {"type": "cause", "site_name": "Thrive Changes and Spotlight #1 | Thrive", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/thrivemovementassets/resources/images/000/001/603/original/consciousness-human-awakening-mountain-top-galaxy.jpg", "title": "Thrive Changes and Spotlight #1", "url": "http://www.thrivemovement.com/spotlight-1.blog", "description": "Important articles from sources across a full spectrum of world views, curated by Foster Gamble"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.zengardner.com/jedi-mind-underground-trojan-horses/", "http://www.zengardner.com/jedi-mind-underground-trojan-horses/", "http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/2016/03/10/pa-families-win-4-million-verdict-against-gas-driller/81605868", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIHtuKc3Gjg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIHtuKc3Gjg", "http://www.activistpost.com/2015/12/switzerland-follows-iceland-in-declaring-war-against-the-banksters.html", "http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/26/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-american-idol-cry-piece-by-piece-feat", "http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/26/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-american-idol-cry-piece-by-piece-feat", "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/legal-marijuana-killing-cartels", "http://truthstreammedia.com/2016/02/16/1924-newspaper-article-outlines-six-goals-of-the-illuminati/", "http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-un-plans-to-implement-universal-biometric-identification-for-all-of-humanity-by-2030", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngd43GWBA08", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngd43GWBA08", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9gN5F4mGfo", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9gN5F4mGfo", "http://www.businessinsider.com/john-mcafee-nsa-back-door-gives-every-us-secret-to-enemies-2016-2", "http://truthstreammedia.com/2016/02/22/youll-never-guess-what-americans-are-most-afraid-of", "http://www.policestateusa.com/2015/gray-state-suicide", "http://yournewswire.com/ny-times-reporter-found-dead-after-exposing-mkultra", "http://www.theeventchronicle.com/study/six-former-us-presidents-warn-about-invisible-shadow-government/", "http://bit.ly/1RfHMar", "http://bit.ly/1RfHMar"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
