The proposal targets six notorious PFAS: PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS and GenX.\n\n\n\nThe limits, known as maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs, are the highest level of a contaminant allowed in drinking water. The MCLs announced are 4 parts per trillion, or ppt, for PFOA and 4 ppt for PFOS. For the other four PFAS the agency is proposing using a \u201chazard index\u201d which is a tool used to address cumulative risks from mixtures of chemicals.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/", "title": "EWG's Tap Water Database: What's in Your Drinking Water?", "description": " Look up your local water system to find out which pollutants might be of concern, and find suggestions on the best kinds of home filters to remove those chemicals.", "image": "https://static.ewg.org/reports/2017/tap-water/img/EWG_Social_Share_TWDB.jpg", "type": "website"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2023/03/epa-proposes-bold-new-limits-pfoa-and-pfos-drinking-water", "#results-by-state-map", "advanced-search.php"], "authors": ["Environmental Working Group"], "publish_date": null}
