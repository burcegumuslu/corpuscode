Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product\u2019s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nExcluding \u201c foreign reports \u201d to VAERS, 842,576 adverse events , including 13,604 deaths and 85,731 serious injuries , were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 8, 2022.\n\nOf the 29,460 reported deaths, 19,066 cases are attributed to Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, 7,770 cases to Moderna and 2,563 cases to Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nThe data included a total of 29,460 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 187 over the previous week \u2014 and 243,466 serious injuries , including deaths, during the same time period \u2014 up 1,566 compared with the previous week.\n\nVAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today released new data showing a total of 1,341,608 reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines were submitted between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 8, 2022, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). That\u2019s an increase of 12,473 adverse events over the previous week.\n\nVAERS data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 1,341,608 reports of adverse events from all age groups following COVID-19 vaccines, including 29,460 deaths and 243,466 serious injuries between Dec. 14, 2020, and July 8, 2022\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed.\n\nHistorically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for 6-month-olds to 5-year-olds show:\n\u2022 2,105 adverse events, including 71 cases rated as serious and 3 reported deaths.\n\u2022 4 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation).\n\n The CDC uses a narrowed case definition of \u201cmyocarditis,\u201d which excludes cases of cardiac arrest, ischemic strokes and deaths due to heart problems that occur before one has the chance to go to the emergency department.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\u2022 11,868 adverse events, including 305 rated as serious and 8 reported deaths.\n\n The latest reported death (VAERS I.D. #2359520) occurred in an 11-year-old boy from Texas who received two doses of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine. According to his report, the boy died 54 days after his second dose from \u201cCOVID-19 infection resulting in Hemorrhagic myocarditis and death.\u201d\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 32,609 adverse events, including 1,845 rated as serious and 44 reported deaths.\n\u2022 62 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death \u2014 with 97% of cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 656 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis with 644 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 166 reports of blood clotting disorders with all cases attributed to Pfizer. VAERS reported 167 cases of blood clotting disorders in the 12- to 17-year-old age group last week.\n\u2022 20 cases of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with all cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to July 8, 2022, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 20% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 41% were female and the remaining death reports did not include the gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 73.\n\u2022 As of July 8, 5,643 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccines, including 1,765 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 3,624 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 40% to Moderna and 8% to J&J.\n\u2022 900 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, with 42% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 30% to Moderna and 27% to J&J.\n\u2022 2,291 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.\n\u2022 14,200 reports of blood-clotting disorders in the U.S. Of those, 6,348 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 5,088 reports to Moderna and 2,717 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 4,263 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 2,612 cases attributed to Pfizer, 1,448 cases to Moderna and 187 cases to J&J.\n\u2022 14 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with 8 cases attributed Pfizer, 5 cases to Moderna and 1 case to J&J.\n\u2022 269 cases of POTS with 165 cases attributed to Pfizer, 86 cases to Moderna and 17 cases to J&J.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.\n\nThe FDA on Wednesday granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine for adults 18 and over.\n\nThe EUA is for a two-dose primary series targeting the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus \u2014 limiting the vaccine\u2019s use, as about two-thirds of Americans already have completed a primary series of either the Pfizer, Moderna or J&J vaccines.\n\nThe CDC still needs to sign off on the Novavax vaccine before pharmacies and other healthcare providers can start administering the product.\n\nThe Biden administration on Monday announced a deal with Novavax to purchase 3.2 million doses of the vaccine contingent on both the FDA and CDC signing off on the new shot.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine relies on a protein-based technology used for decades, leading some media outlets to portray it as a \u201ctraditional\u201d vaccine compared with other COVID-19 vaccines that use newer technologies \u2014 which might make it appeal to unvaccinated people who are allergic to components of the mRNA vaccines, or just skeptical of the newer technologies.\n\nBut according to Dr. Meryl Nass, an internist with a special interest in vaccine-induced illnesses, chronic fatigue syndrome and toxicology, the media\u2019s portrayal of Novavax as a more traditional vaccine is not accurate.\n\nNass, a member of the CHD scientific advisory committee, pointed out that the Novavax shot contains a novel adjuvant, Matrix-M, \u201cso it is not really an old-fashioned shot.\u201d\n\nNass raised safety concerns specific to the adjuvant, while others voiced concerns about Novavax being linked to heart inflammation and blood clots, and the fact that the vaccine was designed for use against the original Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 not the Omicron variants that are dominant today.\n\nIn a move CHD President Mary Holland called \u201chead-spinning,\u201d the FDA on July 10 granted full approval of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents 12 through 15 years old.\n\nIn an FDA press release, the agency said full approval of Comirnaty follows a \u201crigorous analysis and evaluation of the safety and effectiveness data,\u201d and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine \u201chas been, and will continue to be authorized for emergency use in this age group since May 2021.\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s press release announcing the approval said the Comirnaty vaccine has been available under EUA since May 2021 for the adolescent age group.\n\nYet, Comirnaty is not available in the U.S for any age group and is not the same formula as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine currently authorized under EUA and being distributed as a \u201cfully approved\u201d vaccine.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine documents released in July by the FDA reveal three more reports of deaths among vaccine trial participants and further instances of Pfizer downplaying serious adverse events sustained by participants and listing the injuries as \u201cnot related\u201d to the vaccine.\n\nOf the approximately 80,000 pages released this month, a 3,611-page \u201cconfidential\u201d document contains information about clinical trial participants who died, sustained adverse events during the trial or contracted COVID-19 during the trial.\n\nIn all three cases of reported deaths, the investigator ruled out the possibility that the deaths were related to Pfizer\u2019s vaccines.\n\nOne instance pertains to a 56-year-old white female who suffered cardiac arrest within two months of her second Pfizer dose. The second reported death involves a 60-year-old white male who received one dose of the vaccine and died within three days of atherosclerotic disease. The participant\u2019s death was attributed to a \u201csuspected\u201d cause, while the possibility that it was vaccine-related in any way was dismissed.\n\nThe third death was listed under the section in the document where trial participants withdrew. A 72-year-old man developed vasovagal syncope after receiving the vaccine, was transferred to the intensive care unit and then withdrawn from the study. He died three days after being withdrawn.\n\nAccording to the documents, investigators attributed the vaccine to serious adverse events in four cases, however, Pfizer disagreed with the investigators\u2019 conclusions in three out of the four cases.\n\nAccording to Alexandra Latypova, an ex-pharmaceutical industry executive, documents obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine suggest the FDA and Moderna colluded to bypass regulatory and scientific standards used to ensure products are safe.\n\nAfter analyzing 699 pages of studies and test results \u201csupposedly used by the FDA to clear Moderna\u2019s mRNA platform-based mRNA-1273, or Spikevax,\u201d Latypova told The Defender she believes U.S. health agencies are lying to the public on behalf of vaccine manufacturers and subverting the regulatory and scientific standards of drug safety testing.\n\n\u201cThey accepted fraudulent test designs, substitutions of test articles, glaring omissions and whitewashing of serious signs of health damage by the product, then lied to the public on behalf of the manufacturers,\u201d she said.\n\nLatypova disclosed six findings from her assessment of Moderna\u2019s documents raising serious questions about the safety and efficacy of the company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, as well as conflicts of interests that she says allowed Moderna to sidestep drug development standards.\n\nTennis champ Djokovic has \u2018no plans\u2019 to get vaccinated as US Open tournament nears\n\nTennis champion Novak Djokovic, who last weekend won his fourth straight title at Wimbledon, said he has no plans to get vaccinated in order to bypass restrictions to enter the U.S. in August for the US Open.\n\nDjokovic said he doesn\u2019t think an exemption is \u201crealistically possible.\u201d It\u2019s just a matter of whether or not the U.S. removes the requirement in time for him to attend the tournament, he said.\n\nU.S. COVID-19 vaccination requirements for foreigners bar Djokovic\u2019s entry into the country where he would normally compete at the US Open.\n\nSerbia\u2019s Djokovic, 35, has been dominant at Wimbledon for the past couple of years, according to Tennis World USA. He is regarded by some as the world\u2019s greatest tennis player ever.\n\nPhillies catcher will miss two-game series in Canada rather than comply with vaccine mandate\n\nPhillies catcher J.T. Realmuto said he refuses to get vaccinated against COVID-19, even it if means missing Philadelphia\u2019s two-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays this week.\n\nPlayers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 are not allowed to enter Canada due to the country\u2019s restrictions. In addition, players will not be paid for the games they miss as part of Major League Baseball\u2019s new collective bargaining agreement.\n\nRealmuto will lose about $262,000 for missing the series, which he called \u201ca little bit of money,\u201d the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Realmuto signed a five-year, $115.5 million contract with the Phillies in January 2021.\n\nRealmuto said he is a 31-year-old professional athlete who had COVID-19 several times with mild symptoms. After speaking with doctors, he didn\u2019t think he needed it and wasn\u2019t going to get vaccinated just because he was told to.", "opengraph": {"title": "20% of Deaths Reported After COVID
