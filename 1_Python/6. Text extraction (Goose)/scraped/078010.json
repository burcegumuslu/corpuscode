And in Canada, there was a policy of offering free ice cream to children to get them to take the jab even without their parents\u2019 approval. So those are just two particularly clear examples of unfair coercion \u2026 It\u2019s not actually legal.\u201d\n\nMalone likened what\u2019s going on today with COVID vaccines to the illegal medical experiments conducted by Nazi Germany. \u201c[During the Second World War], Jews and other ethnic groups were subjected to horrible experimental medical research,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd they justified it by saying it was for the common good.\u201d\n\nMalone said the Western World \u201cagreed we weren\u2019t going to do that anymore. Yet, from time to time we seem to forget, and of course, Tuskegee is one example, and frankly, this is another example.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to clear up misinformation coming from the medical establishment, Malone said fully vaccinated individuals can spread COVID. \u201cThe idea that if you have a workplace where everybody\u2019s vaccinated, you\u2019re not going to have virus spread is totally false. A total lie,\u201d Malone said.\n\nThe vaccinated are actually the \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d that everyone was told about at the beginning of the pandemic, Malone argued.\n\n\u201cIf you consider the scientific fact that vaccinated people have fewer symptoms than the unvaccinated, but can still easily spread disease, consider your fellow vaccinated worker, whose unvaccinated son brought the disease home and gave it to him \u2026 He might not have any symptoms \u2026 but he\u2019ll definitely be producing the virus. And he\u2019s going to say, hey, I can go to work today. But he\u2019s going to be spreading the virus-like crazy.\u201d\n\nMalone also touched on the idea of \u201cthe noble lie:\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the government isn\u2019t going to disclose to you what the [vaccine] risks are, and they\u2019re not going to disclose to you what\u2019s really going on because they think that you can\u2019t handle the news \u2026 this is called the noble lie.\u201d\n\nMalone denounced the \u201cnoble lie\u201d as \u201cpaternalistic authoritarianism.\u201d He said the idea of governance-by-lying goes back to Plato and Ancient Greek philosophy which argues that it\u2019s \u201cokay for politicians and people in authority positions to lie to the general public because they have special knowledge and ability to understand things \u2026 and the general public can\u2019t cope with that level of information. And so it\u2019s okay to lie to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really disagree with this line of thinking,\u201d Malone said. \u201cYet it has been public policy in the United States and worldwide in public health for a very long time.\u201d\n\nListen to the podcast here:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fully Vaccinated Are COVID \u2018Super-Spreaders,\u2019 Says Inventor of mRNA Technology", "description": "Dr. Robert Malone likened what\u2019s going on today with COVID vaccines to the illegal medical experiments conducted by Nazi Germany.", "url": "http://consciouslifenews.com/fully-vaccinated-are-covid-super-spreaders-says-inventor-of-mrna-technology/11208441/", "site_name": "Conscious Life News", "article:author": "slykush2377", "article:tag": "mRNA technology", "article:section": "Hazards, Issues & Diseases", "article:published_time": "2021-10-13T04:00:34-07:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-12T19:28:29-07:00", "updated_time": "2021-10-12T19:28:29-07:00", "image": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dr-Robert-Malone-Hidden-Gateway-podcast.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dr-Robert-Malone-Hidden-Gateway-podcast.jpg"}, "tags": ["mRNA technology", "COVID-19 mRNA vaccines", "COVID fully vaccinated", "COVID super-spreaders", "Dr. Robert Malone"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "480", "height": "360", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" id=\"_ytid_98301\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" data-origwidth=\"480\" data-origheight=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/28xqpV6cmcU?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=0&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/28xqpV6cmcU?enablejsapi=1&autoplay=0&cc_load_policy=0&cc_lang_pref=&iv_load_policy=3&loop=0&modestbranding=0&rel=0&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=1&"}], "links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28xqpV6cmcU&t=3805s", "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-hidden-gateway/id1545802002", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/editorial/an-mrna-vaccine-against-sars-cov-2-preliminary-report-a-researcher-reacts/", "https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application#Introduction", "https://consciouslifenews.com/stop-ear-ringing", "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/west-virginia-gov-announces-gun-giveaway-as-part-of-vaccine-incentive/ar-AAKIq2l", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid", "https://www.history.com/news/the-infamous-40-year-tuskegee-study", "https://consciouslifenews.com/hyperbolic-stretching", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/anthony-fauci-misinformation-lies-influence-behavior/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/jeremy-loffredo/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-10-13T04:00:34-07:00"}
