Today we are doing the monthly micro dose. It is June 2022. So we will be doing a very brief show to cover the events of May 2022. You know, the monthly microdose. It\u2019s a recap of the previous shows a couple new ideas. I let you inside the the inside scoop of what\u2019s going to happen this next month. It\u2019s going to be a great time I also address some social media Comments, questions concerns. Without further ado, let\u2019s get into it. I\u2019ve got a lot to talk about. It\u2019s going to be a macro dose I know what that means is more than 20 minutes. I\u2019m going to try like hell though. Let\u2019s go today. Let\u2019s say here. We start with personal winds. A drop some new shirts. Some George Bush Saturnian death cult shirts on the Gumroad store, already sold out almost every size. They got one medium left and a couple of smalls already put an order in. So stay you got to stay close on the social medias or my email newsletter. If you go to Illuminati watchdog calm there\u2019s an email newsletter. In fact, if you sign up, I give you a free copy of my first book. What a guy and I will be announcing when I get those new shirts in. Thank you for your support concern interest cares and love. My man Ryan Bledsoe from the podcast Bledsoe said so probably the greatest name of a podcast ever be created was on tinfoil hat. Now me and Ryan had been in contact we\u2019ve been connected as it were. And we\u2019re going to record a show this month and it\u2019s going to be a banger. The banger of bangers a double banger. And then also shout out to Jimmy over there the Aerie bros. dropped his short film. He\u2019s a big time. He\u2019s gonna be big time Hollywood director. I see it in his future. And he dropped this film shore called Double ripple, you can catch it on YouTube. And you know, I\u2019m always complaining about the length of these movies. I just watched the Norseman it was like two hours and 16 minutes. A great movie, but I was like, ah, we got to wrap this up. I\u2019m losing. I\u2019m losing my will to stay awake. This is what happens when you get old. Get distracted. You want to do some other things. You\u2019re like damn, how\u2019s the longer another 45 minutes? Well, my man Jimmy, he knows what\u2019s made a short one. It\u2019s a short movie. You got plenty of time to watch it. Check it out. It\u2019s called Double ripple and find it on YouTube. And oh yeah. And the reason we\u2019re talking about it is because yours truly was the symbolism advisor. I my first role as an advisor. I\u2019m trying to sell my soul to Hollywood. This is the first step I can\u2019t wait. Cheers. Of course, I joke kind of next social media posts. I did a lot of posting. Okay, a lot of comments. So I\u2019m not going to go through all of them. I\u2019m gonna go through a select few. I made comments about how I was going I made this official statement. I\u2019m going to relaunch the YouTube I\u2019m going to post all these videos it\u2019s going to be great. Didn\u2019t go as I wanted. They\u2019re already blocking all the videos already seeing other people on the copyrighted content on most everything. Same problem I had before I don\u2019t know why I thought it\u2019d be different. It\u2019s because I saw it would be different. Because they now give you the ability to warn them about what controversial content you\u2019ve got in there. So I was like cool. All right. I talked about this this and this bam, bam, bam. Still had problems. Whatever you did was the worst. When are they going to go away? I made a did the MER Write the CrossFit workout. On Memorial Day, every year we do the Murph. And I made a great meme trolling. And got a lot of funny comments. Thank you for everyone making me laugh. I ran a poll about Top Gun too. If you listen to my other show I do with my wife, Josie called breaking social norms. You know, we did a show where we discussed how we went to the theaters for the first time and over two and a half years to go. I mean, it could have been damn near three years honestly. But when to go watch Dr. Strange too, because I had to for this podcast business, right. And we hated the experience. I used to love the movie theater and I hated it. But I\u2019m torn because I want to see Top Gun two really bad and I feel like that\u2019s a movie theater experience. Right? Some some of these shows some of these movies you want to see in the theater? Some you don\u2019t.\n\nBut the poll came out about 5050 more on the sign of maybe I should not go to the theater, given my negative attitude about the theater experience. So you know what, I\u2019m not gonna do it. I\u2019m gonna stay at home. That\u2019s right. Introverts for life, baby. Let\u2019s go let\u2019s isolate let\u2019s introvert. I don\u2019t want to hang out those people anyway. Last city to move you with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. Basically a rip off of Romancing the Stone. But for some weird reason. I loved Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile. Don\u2019t ask me. I couldn\u2019t explain it either. And I read it. Do you hear the dogs barking? I\u2019ll hear in suburban hell. It\u2019s it\u2019s warm out. I got the window popped open. Unfortunately for you, you get dogs. All right. Last city, America polling that said should I even watch this? I mean, I don\u2019t have to go to the theater. It\u2019s streaming on whatever. Paramount I think I got all of them. I don\u2019t know if you know, I got every stupid streaming. They got me every one of them has broken me down. Now I have this dumb cable bill. As well as 1000 add on services. So good job, Hollywood, you win. Last city, the game came out about similar 5050. So I\u2019m like, Yeah, I probably won\u2019t watch it. I ran a poll about Jack Harlow because for some reason, I don\u2019t like him. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m just a hater. Sorry. There\u2019s something very manufactured about the guy that I just it just sticks in my craw. I don\u2019t know what it is. And I said, Hey, do you think Jack Harlow is a puppet? Because sometimes I\u2019d like to check myself maybe I\u2019m just being a jerk. 83% of you said no, he\u2019s a puppet. So I\u2019ll stick with that. I did a clip. Katt Williams has a new stand up comedy on Netflix. And I took a one minute clip from that, where he makes a joke about about the vaccines. And there was actually a larger purpose of me recording that it was just discussing how we don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore. That was the real purpose but that was part of the clip. And it frickin blew up all over. I\u2019m like, Dude, you know, I\u2019ll put together these great means great little videos that I prepare. And I\u2019ll get no traction I take a bootleg of all my phone just recording the the teat standard from the TV record the TV, shitty audio shitty video, and it blows up. Go figure. Alright. I made a post about Dota cat. She was at the VMAs the Billboard Music Awards. She was wearing the Lord of the Rings Sauron the big. What do you what you call it? The Taurus horns of the bold Moloch with the all seeing eye, Saturn. You got to see that one that one was wild. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Also, I made a post about a there\u2019s a coloring book right? If you follow Tom, paranoid American or trans universe on Instagram, both friends of the show here. They put together this great coloring book An adult coloring book of all your favorite conspiracy related people, villains topics, all that. And I colored in the Mark Zuckerberg one, because at the bottom of the mug Zuckerberg it has a person saying these nerds are going to kill us, right? And I shared it on my Instagram and I said check this out. You know bonus points if you can guess who the guy on the bottom right is you know it\u2019s me right to me that everyone says the SAM Tripoli which is very funny to me. I thought that was great because it was actually an image of me pre pandemic and if you don\u2019t know, the pandemic has made me change my appearance greatly and I\u2019m never going back and I grew my hair out real long. Got a bunch of dumb tattoos. piercings because I didn\u2019t have to go into the dreaded day job office. And I was like, for whatever reason, I was like, This is my life from now on. I\u2019m never going back in. So I just went for it. Joke will be on me when I gotta walk back in the office and they, the and they think I\u2019m a homeless guy and they say excuse me, you\u2019ve lost sir. You lost. Can I help you? Kind of get you some McDonald\u2019s or something. But yeah, it was fun. Everyone thought it was Stan Tripoli, so shout out to my, my BFF romantic conspiracy podcast lover, Sam also made a post about comparing me to rat Steven Piercey. I thought that was a fun one too. And I put a lot of great. So Dr. Strange to dr. strange in the multiverse, whatever the frickin name is multiverse. I put together some really good\n\nimages, where I talk about the symbols and I compare it to other images that are supporting it from the occult. Not just screenshots from the movie. You got to check that one out. That was really good. Very proud of that work. Check it out. Okay, that\u2019s social media next. movies and music that I\u2019ve been consuming, as if you care. We\u2019re gonna do it anyway. I\u2019ve been watching the stand, they remade the stand, ironically, released in 2020. During the pandemic, if you know, the stand is the Stephen King epic, about the end of the world because of a deadly virus that releases. And I\u2019m a fan of Stephen King. I\u2019m a fan of the book. I\u2019m a fan of the story. I even watched the 90s one and that one was pretty good. And this new one I\u2019m watching I\u2019m like six episodes in it. It\u2019s great. So far, the reviews are pretty negative about it. And I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know what they expect. I thought it was I think it\u2019s really good. So far. It\u2019s better than the 90s one, or the 90s. One Randall Flagg is in the fold Texas tuxedo, the denim on denim on denim. Ridiculous. I\u2019ve also been the challenge all stars, you know what I\u2019m saying Paramount plus is getting all my action this this month. Watching that, of course, Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, I\u2019ve seen a couple cool episodes of that. They did this episode where they flew in a Cessna plane and sort of tracked, I don\u2019t know, coordinates or whatever. It\u2019s hard to explain quickly. But when they ran the GPS coordinates after the flight, they found that it was showing as if the plane was flying 62 miles underground. Right? Very interesting. And in the show, they\u2019re even like, well, that\u2019s the Karman Line that\u2019s a line that distinguishes space from Earth. Because they got to make a call as to what point in the atmosphere, we consider ourselves in space, and it\u2019s 62 miles. And they\u2019re like, well, that\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s like the Karman Line but below ground. Well, that\u2019s interesting because old Theodore von Karman was part of the Jack Parsons movement for the rocket science, the Suicide Squad stuff. You know, I thought that was interesting. Because Parsons obviously has a lot of their hermetic axiom as above so below stuff going on about how to with this suburban hellhole, I went from dogs to mowing, I gotta close the window and I\u2019m hot. Very sorry, everybody. Very, very unprofessional the monthly microdose this month, but you didn\u2019t come here for professionalism. You came here for a good time. So I thought that was interesting. Then I listened to a Joe Rogan episode with Neal Brennan. Neal Brennan, of course, the the comic associated with the Dave Chappelle Show. And he talks about his mental health journey. All right, you got about how it\u2019s like, almost four hours. It\u2019s ridiculous. You got to about the two hour mark. And he talks about how he couldn\u2019t experience joy. Because he had this New York attitude right very typical of East Coast stuff. And look, I grew up in Lancaster PA which is I feel like Lancaster\u2019s got a surly are bunched in New York City. You know what I mean? Why I don\u2019t know why it is. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s a very, I think it\u2019s because of the heavy German heritage there. It\u2019s a very untrusting people. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Anyway. He talks about how he actually took ketamine but he didn\u2019t like that. But he\u2019s talked about how when he was doing all these hallucinogens, to try to fix his depression. He talks about how he saw machine elves just like Alex Jones talks about I think it was Alex Jones. Joe Rogan\u2019s talking about fractals, and Niels said it was kind of like neon graph with paper squares and stuff. And he says, Well, you Doing the ketamine he was aware that people were in the room. He just, he just couldn\u2019t interact with them, which tells me because I\u2019ve done a lot of ketamine treatments, and I promise you I\u2019m doing a show someday soon when I don\u2019t know. But the experience I had was very similar to those things. But I had a higher dosage, I think because I completely dissociated, no idea. There was people in the room, no idea what a person was. I was out there in the fractals, it was very strange. Many times I do this, I have done this, I should say. But at a clinic, right. I don\u2019t advocate for illegal drug use. Because you never know what you\u2019re getting. Not because I\u2019m anti drug, but because you don\u2019t know what these people are mixing in with these drugs. So I went to a clinic. It\u2019s a therapeutic setting. This isn\u2019t like, oh, let\u2019s go have a party. You know what I mean?\n\nSo there you go. But anyway, she talks about how he switched over to ayahuasca and start taking these hero doses of that stuff. And he says, he\u2019s out in space, and he sees the earth getting destroyed. And he says, he says this, he says, they\u2019re destroying Saturn and children and everything. And as Joe Rogan and asked him what he meant by that, and I said, Well, that\u2019s bizarre. Why, why bring up Saturn and all this. And then about the three hour and 29 minute mark, he says he may he starts, oh my god, creating Saturn. And it\u2019s very interesting because if you look at the conspiracy story that David Icke presents about the Saturn moon matrix, he talks about this, he talks about how the frequency that trapped us in this limited reality comes from Saturn and goes to the moon, and ultimately to Earth. And there\u2019s a lot of support for this stuff, right. Saturn is when these massive topics, but I thought was very interesting. So shout out, you know, I didn\u2019t write the name now. Someone told me to check it out. Sorry about that. Thank you for the recommendation. Good call. letter box. Okay, so, as you know, I\u2019ve got a letter box. What\u2019s letterbox? Well, it\u2019s like Yelp, but for movies, right? It\u2019s like a social media for movie watching. Without all the negative politics stuff going on. And I\u2019ve got a username it\u2019s at Isaac Weishaupt. You can check it out for yourself. And let\u2019s see what movies I\u2019ve reviewed. Well, because it\u2019s already June 6. I did the northmen. I watched that last night. I loved it. I thought it was great. Robert egrets is a champion because he did the witch and what was the other one? The lighthouse, which I\u2019ve done film analysis on both of those. Will I do one on the north one? Probably not. I don\u2019t think so. I watched the Blackwell ghost hated it. I watched the white hot the rise and fall of Abercrombie and Fitch it was fine. watched the triple exaptation documentary look at me five stars. Great documentary. Great story. Not great in the sense of like, is a tragic story or tragic. I watched the mystery man in a row the on her tapes. It was good. The guy\u2019s a bozo. He goes through. He\u2019s got years and years of recordings that basically proves there was this weird conspiracy to take her out. And then he concludes at the end. Well, I don\u2019t think it was a conspiracy to take her out. Bro. When are you going to wake up? Then I watched Vamp here from 1932 hated it. Count Dracula from 1970. That\u2019s the first one with Christopher Lee portraying Dracula it was good. Watch dr. strange one. It was fine. Dr. Strange to it was fine. Jackass forever great. Great movie but I love Jackass can\u2019t go wrong there. Those are my people. They\u2019re from se pa so I gotta hold down. Dracula, Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula from 92 If you can believe it or not, isn\u2019t the first time I watched the movie. The first time I made it through and boy was I pleasantly surprised. Great movie. One of my favorites. One of my favorite vampire movies. Loved it. Because tacos last orgy it was a weird movie, but it\u2019s fine. Should you go buy the DVD like I had to add on? No, maybe not. Dracula from 1931 the Bela Lugosi classic. Didn\u2019t like it. I thought it was boring. Nosferatu, the classic from 1922 didn\u2019t like it. I thought it was boring. Cypress Hill and saying the brain documentary. Great, but I love Cypress Hill. I watched The Hunger with David Bowie and Susan Sarandon from 1983 loved it. Five stars. My favorite vampire movie with the Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula a very close second. I watched Steven Greer is above top secret hated it. Nothing new spoken of complete waste of my money just like the app. I mean, I come on. I love Steven Greer. I have a love hate for Steven Greer. I like what he\u2019s doing. But then at the same time, I don\u2019t It\u2019s very weird. Then of course, Top Gun is a classic. I watched that To prepare for the film analysis, and then for good measure the Edge of Tomorrow, a five star movie a perfect maybe the maybe the best Tom Cruise movie, which sounds weird to say, because he\u2019s got so many great movies. It might be though, it might be, I think it depends on your mood. Because Tom Cruise can do anything he can do any character doesn\u2019t matter. Oh, and in that triple X tentation documentary, they make mention to how he was doing drugs. He was doing hallucinogens, he did LSD, and they flat out city, he was talking to demons and I put that clip on my instagram at Isaac wise up, you need to check it out for yourself. And,\n\nyou know, it blew up with a lot of opinions about what that meant. Okay, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about it. But I don\u2019t know what was it literal? I mean, if you look at these occult practices, the Dionysian practices they talk about taking drugs to alter the consciousness right. And then that Doc, there\u2019s video footage of him talking about how he\u2019s not going to make it to 21 which is true he died at 20 If you recall, the juice real documentary shows similar issues. His girlfriend said it looked like juice world had demons following him. Or all these people crazy or they\u2019re really demons. Are the demons tied into drug abuse and addiction? valid questions I don\u2019t know the answer. I wouldn\u2019t fault you for thinking either way though. Right. Show recaps let\u2019s talk about the shows we did in May. Did a oops on nerd show. I did a TMZ where we talked about the roundup you know Met Gala. Coachella has Moloch Machine Gun Kelly Megan Fox are drinking the blood. DNA word is got a lot of allegations about abuse lobbed their way. Dave Chappelle to baby Mike Tyson. Everyone\u2019s been in the news. Then we did a Friday the 13th special where we talked about the Knights Templar the Baphomet and the symbolism of the double cross turned out to be one of the most well received shows of the month. surprising me a little bit Top Gun again another one of these surprisingly popular shows. I didn\u2019t think it would have a lot there to talk about given the lack of occult symbolism. But I had Florida man he hit me up says hey man, do a Tom Cruise show you don\u2019t you don\u2019t do too many Tom Cruise shows. I said you don\u2019t want I don\u2019t do any Tom Cruise shows. You\u2019re right. And I said that at the preamble of Top Gun. And no less than 1000 people reached out said Hey, dummy. You did like eight episodes on Eyes Wide Shut a Tom Cruise movie. I was like yeah, that\u2019s fair. That\u2019s fair. I was wrong All right. Now I might do another Tom Cruise movie someday here. He\u2019s got so many I just don\u2019t know. I was looking up. In fact, here\u2019s here\u2019s something I can add to the Top Gun symbolism analysis. I was looking up. Anthony Edwards, the actor the plate goose, because I had heard something in passing about how the guy in the new movie looks or was the actual son of Anthony Edwards. I said no way. And it\u2019s not true. But I didn\u2019t know this for the Top Gun film analysis that it was revealed in 2017 that Gary Goddard had sexually assaulted Anthony Edwards when Anthony Edwards was young. Now Goddard, he ties into Bryan Singer, which is the guy directed the X man has all kinds of symbolism and all that crap right. Now, in Goddard, he also directed Masters of the Universe, right the 80s movie with Dolph Lundgren probably want us to revisit I used to talk about masters of the universe a lot with the in my first book a grand unified conspiracy theory. Early in my journey, which I like I said, you can get a free copy of a grand unified Conspiracy Theory, signing for my free email newsletter. Go to Illuminati watch.com. I think it\u2019s the Start Here tab that don\u2019t get confused because I\u2019ve got a free email newsletter. Then I have the VIPs set up. The VIP tab is something completely different. That\u2019s access to the podcast don\u2019t get confused. If you make a mistake, either way, hit me up. I\u2019ll try to fix it for you. I will fix it. I own all this stuff. Also, a web publisher adds a list of titles. Now Anyways, on Wikipedia says on November 10 2017, actor Anthony Edwards wrote an SEO The medium in which she alleged that God had molested him and raped his best friend for years, starting when they were 12 years old. Speaking on behalf of Goddard, his publicist denied the allegations. And we know Bryan Singer got a lot of allegations lob is when it didn\u2019t look good for him. And I don\u2019t remember what the deal was the charges were dropped. I don\u2019t remember. But if you watch an open secret, they put together a pretty persuasive argument. All right. So that\u2019s tongren. We did Aaron Salter buffalo theory about the pew pew pew right at the grocery store, and the free energy stuff. And I think it was the day I published it was the day of the other one. I mean, it\u2019s just like left and right you know. The one in Texas right?\n\nWe did a dr. strange one we did Dr. Strange to busy month. Then we did over on rock fan. I have a show called inside the mind of a conspiracy theorist. It\u2019s belong as a rock fan. It\u2019s an exclusive show. I do their monthly over there. We did a thing called Truth or drama. And that\u2019s the last one I\u2019m doing about me. Truth, the drama about me. People attack me. And I\u2019m just over you\u2019re trying to spread love. And I did a show it was about. Let\u2019s see. We\u2019ll just got Ryan Christian over at the last American Vagabond called me a fake conspiracy theorist unprovoked attack. You know, a lot of people assure me like, Oh, he\u2019s a nice guy. He wouldn\u2019t ever talk trash. So that\u2019s fine. I actually will take that to be the truth. I don\u2019t think that he knows who I am. He probably just said it and just he hasn\u2019t apologized to me yet. Whatever it\u2019s fine you know added to the list of people who hate me for reasons that I don\u2019t understand. Now Steven Greer talk bad about me I\u2019d get it because he I always borderline talk trash about him. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t talk to him. I love him. I love his ideas. Right? He\u2019s got this very granola vibe. Just wish he would bring the goods more. That\u2019s all. Then I do a show with my wife breaking social norms. We\u2019ve been knocking bangers out all month we\u2019re really hitting our stride. We did two episodes of rocks and decent obsession with underage girls where we analyze songs and musicians who have had problematic obsessions with young girls under 18 It\u2019s very gross. Very sleazy. We did a movie talk episode we did a Doctor Strange episode. It\u2019s mostly me trying to explain to a Normie my life while this conspiracy stuff is what it is, is a very stripped down gossipy Chilean kind of show very different than this one. And then we did two episodes on sex. Oh my god, it\u2019s so scandalous. It\u2019s you know, how do I find the kids uncensored? Explicit as all get out, we get very personal very private. If you want to be a creeper, those of the episodes you just creep on. I\u2019ll be honest with you. So I did two sexy time episodes with her. And then we have a patreon for breaking social norms called patreon.com backslash breaking social norms. And we added bonus content, we do a very short ad lib show called The Morning Coffee with the wise ops. So that\u2019s only for Patreon supporters not rockfon Not free feed. Now that is only for Patreon as our way of saying thanks because those people go above and beyond so man, lots of shows and then in May we did a bonus show for all my supporters that are on my Patreon that are on my rock fan that are on my VIP section about the UFO Congress. And we talked about how they flood a flat out basically said that the UFOs are coming from the ocean UFOs as it were, okay. Very strange. June Oh, man, we\u2019re gonna get it done in under 30. Let\u2019s go June. We got some Did you hear my Doctor Strange to episode had a very secret contest announced in that episode. I did a giveaway for a shirt on my Instagram. But you gotta hear the episode for the details. I\u2019m announcing it Tuesday at 2pm. Eastern. Maybe you\u2019ll hear this episode and be able to hop on it. Maybe you won\u2019t. Maybe you won\u2019t. That\u2019s only for the people that are really the big fans that really listened. I\u2019ll do another one in the future. In June, I plan on doing a movie analysis for the seller. It\u2019s a movie on shutter. I think I watched it. I\u2019m going to do a show on Johnny Depp. Shout out Damien Echols, who follows me on Twitter had no idea. I had no idea that was happening. I don\u2019t know when he followed me. I found out the hard way someone tagged me on a post of his I couldn\u2019t see it. So I went to his page to follow him so I could see it and much to my shock. He follows me. Now I have mixed feelings about that. Right? I have mixed feelings about it. And maybe someday we can talk well, let\u2019s talk about Now what do I feel about it? Well, if you go so on my journey of truth prisms when I started I was very overzealous. I didn\u2019t understand any of this stuff. I felt like everything was attack attacking Christianity almost right. I had a very much that angle.\n\nI interviewed William Ramsay once because he wrote a book where he talks about the West Memphis Three case and suggests that maybe it\u2019s not what it seems because I watched those West Memphis Three documents or documentaries. And after watching them, I\u2019d get pissed. I\u2019d be like, This is bullshit, man. Because I\u2019m young. I understand one thing about me I\u2019m very much a root for the underdog. That\u2019s my vulnerability. I wrote for the underdog. I don\u2019t love the legal system. I don\u2019t love prisons. I don\u2019t love cops. Sorry, cops. It\u2019s a tough, I used to always have to put my caveats out there, right. My dad was in law enforcement. So I get it on some levels. But it\u2019s a tough job. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s an easy job. It\u2019s a scary job. You\u2019re dealing with the worst people on the planet. But there\u2019s also some abuses that happen there. And I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like it one bit. And when I read the book, I remember one of the takeaways being like reading through the testimonies of each of the western half of three Damien Echols included, and it seemed like they admitted it almost. And I thought, What the hell the documentaries make it sound like, you know, they didn\u2019t mention this. And I thought we had been bamboozled. But as I\u2019ve gotten older and wiser, I realized that, like if you watch and I can be wrong about all this. I\u2019m not a legal expert by any stretch. There\u2019s one on Netflix about that, man, I don\u2019t remember. But the police, they interrogate these people for an insane amount of time till they break down and they\u2019re like, I\u2019ll tell you, whatever you want to hear, just let me out of this room. They do that? Because these people don\u2019t plead the fifth. I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t. They just don\u2019t. You got to plead the fifth. Because if you\u2019re innocent, I know if you think, Well, I\u2019m innocent, I got nothing to hide. They\u2019re going to things you say will be used against you. They tell you in the Miranda rights. You can\u2019t plead the fifth, you can\u2019t talk to him. You just can\u2019t. Sorry. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. If cops didn\u2019t abuse it and put innocent people in jail. I wouldn\u2019t say it. But that\u2019s just the nature. We live in a litigious society. A good friend of mine told me once and it\u2019s true. The gotta be careful. You ever follow the pop brothers that law? They talk about the script? You know, you get pulled over and you said, I\u2019m not discussing my day with you? Is there a reason you pulled me over? My being detained? Or am I free to go like, there\u2019s a script, right? Because you got to be careful, man, like a lot of us are law abiding citizens. And we\u2019re trying to do the right thing. But you got to understand these cops like to every every, every, every to a hammer, everything\u2019s a nail, right? They\u2019re just trying to do their job. But you got to be careful. They\u2019re not your friend. They\u2019re not here to protect, to necessarily protect and serve you. They don\u2019t know if you\u2019re the good guy or the bad guy, especially when you look like a scumbag like me. Anyway, well, I\u2019m not Oh, yeah. So part of me has thought, well, maybe Damien Echols, didn\u2019t do it. Maybe they were just like kids that got screwed with maybe they were in these interrogation rooms for 20 hours or whatever these these cops were doing. So ultimately, I resigned to the thing of like, Man, I don\u2019t know, I hope he did. I hope they didn\u2019t do that. I hope they didn\u2019t do it. And then on top of that, Damien Echols has been petitioning to, I guess, like, reopen the case or something or get some DNA testing done for some new evidence or something as like, that doesn\u2019t sound like a guilty guy. To me. That sounds like a guy who knows he\u2019s innocent, and wants to prove it was some other guy. Then he had an all the weird religious sentiment down in the south. That happens in the small towns, and oh, boy, it\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s a mess. And ultimately, you got to understand that like, I\u2019d rather have someone if they\u2019re if they\u2019re innocent, be out then be put to death. I\u2019m against the death penalty period. Because you get because look, as a Christian, you\u2019re supposed to give people time to find their path to Christ. And if you put them to death early, then they didn\u2019t really get a fair chance did they? Even though if they did horrific things? least that\u2019s my understanding of how to look at it. So I say all that to say this. Look, I don\u2019t know, man, if Damien Echols did that stuff, like, and you believe in Christ and God, and you\u2019re worried about this guy and doing all this satanic stuff? Fine assurance and being like, well, when he dies, God will be the ultimate judge. And if he did those horrific things, then he\u2019ll pay the price then. Right? But if he\u2019s innocent, which it seems like he is, seems like it, but how would we know we weren\u2019t there? We don\u2019t know. But if he\u2019s innocent, then great, you know, our glory be to God. All right, you got to let God do what God does. Anyway, why am I talking about oh yeah, because I\u2019m doing a Johnny Depp analysis and that\u2019s gonna come up. Do an analysis Johnny Depp was Johnny Depp was of course friends with Damien Echols. ipso facto I\u2019m friends with Johnny Depp now, so I gotta be careful with Johnny Depp too. What am I gonna do? You know,\n\nJohnny that\u2019s got all these called things about them. And then I watched these clips from the trial. And I think god darn it he\u2019s so cool though, man. He\u2019s so cool. How can I hate a guy it\u2019s so cool. And he\u2019s been the all these great movies. And he\u2019s in the first Nightmare on Elm Street for God\u2019s sake. This guy\u2019s a legend. He\u2019s a legend the walks amongst us but is he? Is he an occultist? Is he illuminate? Confirm, we\u2019re gonna find out. I\u2019m going to talk to you about it. Good night, move on Isaac. Then, of course, I\u2019ve got this book, this little book called cobalt and Oh, call a bit 80 bucks for this thing all the way from the United Kingdom. This is the book Stanley Kubrick read and underlined passages and when he did Eyes Wide Shut the movie. And I\u2019m going to dig into it and we\u2019re going to I\u2019m going to reveal the truth to you about it. Oh, all right. I gotta move it along. We\u2019re done. We\u2019re done.
