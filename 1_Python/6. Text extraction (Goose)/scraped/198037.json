This would allegedly be the ideal way to secure the best protection against reinfection.\n\nSurprisingly, researchers reported the opposite in the new study, saying a weaker immune response would develop if one already battled the disease before vaccination.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude and quality of a key immune cell\u2019s response to vaccination with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were considerably lower in people with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to people without prior infection,\u201d the NIH wrote on its website.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the level of this key immune cell that targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was substantially lower in unvaccinated people with COVID-19 than in vaccinated people who had never been infected.\u201d\n\nThe study conducted by researchers from Stanford University and published in the journal Immunity suggested that the virus could be damaging an important immune-cell response, causing this phenomenon to happen.\n\nThe research team concluded that their findings highlight the importance of developing vaccination strategies to boost the antiviral responses in people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\u201cThe apparent damage of the CD8+ T cell response by viral infection is cause for concern, and may leave even vaccinated individuals with a prior infection at risk for subsequent infections or other health issues,\u201d the study authors noted.\n\nThe new research came amid the recent efforts of public health officials and medical experts to develop new approaches for Covid vaccination, including the idea of making periodic boosters available just like the annual flu shots, as per CNBC.\n\nSince the pandemic started in 2020, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 100 million people in the U.S. and killed over 1 million, based on the latest CDC tracking data.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Medical Daily", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/covid-infection-vaccination-weakens-vaccine-protection-468863", "title": "COVID-19 Infection Before Vaccination Weakens Protection Against Reinfection: Study", "description": "People who contracted the disease before vaccination develop weaker immune protection against reinfection.", "image": "https://d.medicaldaily.com/en/full/464888/covid-england.jpg", "image:alt": "Covid in England", "image:width": "594", "image:height": "396", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MedicalDaily/", "article:section": "Covid-19", "article:tag": "Protection", "article:published_time": "2023-03-22T20:42:07-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-22T20:42:07-04:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/sars-cov-2-infection-weakens-immune-cell-response-vaccination", "https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(23)00125-5#secsectitle0010", "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/if-you-had-covid-before-you-were-vaccinated-you-might-have-less-immunity-than-you-think-study-says-.html", "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home", "/link-between-obesity-and-covid-19-may-be-explained-underactive-immune-response-468823"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-03-22T20:42:07-04:00"}
