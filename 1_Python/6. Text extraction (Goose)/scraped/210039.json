Of course, AstraZeneca representatives say it\u2019s, \u201cunlikely to be associated with the vaccine.\u201d\n\nBut, this news certainly has many people wondering: how long will these trials continue to be allowed to go on?\n\nDangerous trend: SECOND person suffers a serious health condition during COVID-19 vaccine trial, reports say\n\nIs there an echo in here? Earlier this month, we reported that AstraZeneca paused its UK COVID-19 vaccine trial because a volunteer experienced serious neurological symptoms consistent with a rare inflammatory disease called transverse myelitis. Officials admitted the victim had been injected with the investigational vaccine and not a placebo.\n\nLater, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the female participant also happened to have undiagnosed multiple sclerosis, which she claimed had nothing to do with the drug. The phase 3 vaccine trial subsequently resumed.\n\nNow, reports reveal a SECOND female participant has come down with transverse myelitis. She developed symptoms after getting a follow-up dose of the vaccine.\n\nTwo cases of a rare and serious neurological condition occurring in the same drug trial \u2013 and yet we\u2019re supposed to believe what AstraZeneca says, that the illnesses were \u2018unlikely to be related\u2019 to the vaccine.\n\nMeanwhile, at the CDC: \u201ccurrent best estimate\u201d suggests that death rate of COVID-19 is LESS than the flu!\n\nTell us again why we have to furiously develop a new vaccine and vaccinate the majority of the population before we can get back to \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that Dr. Anthony Fauci and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) keep hinting that the novel coronavirus isn\u2019t as deadly as the media firestorm wants people to think it is?\n\nUpdated on September 10, the CDC presents on their website five of their \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios.\u201d The CDC claims these aren\u2019t predictions but rather simply to \u201cadvance public health preparedness and planning.\u201d Yet they label the fifth of their scenarios as their \u201cCurrent Best Estimate\u201d for how COVID-19 is impacting the country.\n\nHere\u2019s what the CDC says is the current BEST estimate about the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19:\n\nInfection fatality rate refers to the total number of deaths divided by all the people who have the given infection, whether they have symptoms or not. This is in contrast to case fatality rate, which is the total number of deaths divided by the people who have clinical symptoms of the disease.\n\nThose aren\u2019t typos, by the way:\n\nThe CDC\u2019s current best estimate is that the IFR for COVID-19 is 0.005 to 0.054 for some of the most \u201cat risk\u201d age groups. This is a lot lower than the IFR for the seasonal flu!\n\nJust read a section from a paper published in March of this year in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by Dr. Anthony Fauci himself:\n\n\u201cIf one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases [of COVID-19] is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.\u201d\n\nAs other sources have pointed out, Dr. Fauci and colleagues misspoke here: they should have used the terminology \u201cinfection fatality rate\u201d rather than case fatality rate. Regardless, the implications are shocking.\n\nAnd sure, lots has changed since March 2020, but even so, the U.S. government\u2019s \u201ccurrent best estimate\u201d is still directly in line with Fauci\u2019s hypothesis \u2026 yet here we are: many places still on lockdown and our country being told that only a hastily developed vaccine (for a virus which may be less deadly than the seasonal flu) can save us.\n\nThe question remains: do our current circumstances justify the kind of response being put forth by so-called \u201chealth experts?\u201d Or, is there another agenda being played out on the general public?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Failure Again | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial reports about another victim of neurological problems after receiving the vaccine.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/covid-19-vaccine-trial-failure-3573.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2020-09-30T05:11:20+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-09-29T11:35:35+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/covid-19-failure-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "576", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.rt.com/news/501221-astrazeneca-vaccine-neurological-condition/", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/covid-trial-on-hold-3556.html", "https://www.rt.com/news/501221-astrazeneca-vaccine-neurological-condition/", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejme2002387", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#five-scenarios", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/19/health/astrazeneca-vaccine-safety-blueprints.html"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2020-09-30T05:11:20+00:00"}
