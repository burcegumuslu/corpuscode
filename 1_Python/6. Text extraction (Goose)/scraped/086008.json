Our patient presented with acute kidney injury two weeks after receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) vaccine. Renal biopsy confirmed focal crescentic glomerulonephritis. The patient has been unable to achieve remission after diagnosis and is now a candidate for a kidney transplant. In conclusion, this case report provides insight into the possible relationship between glomerular disease following COVID-19 Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) vaccination. Based on this presented case, new-onset or relapse of glomerular diseases presenting post-COVID-19 vaccination should be observed as a possible adverse event to large-scale COVID-19 vaccination.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/133245-focal-crescentic-glomerulonephritis-following-covid-19-viral-vector-vaccination?authors-tab=true", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "Focal Crescentic Glomerulonephritis Following COVID-19 Viral Vector Vaccination", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
