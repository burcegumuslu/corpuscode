MERS is one of the most deadly strains of coronavirus, and has been known to pneumonia, fever and even organ failure. However, human to human transmission is far less common with the MERS strain than we have seen with the new COVID-19 strain, so it is far less contagious.\n\nResearchers treated the infected monkeys with an experimental vaccine called remdesivir, which has been shown to be effective for multiple different coronavirus strains.\n\nThe researchers found that the experimental drug was also effective at treating the monkeys in their study that were infected with MERS. This has led the team to conclude that this drug could be effective at treating the new COVID-19 coronavirus strain.\n\nThe conclusion of the study stated that \u201cTaken together, the data presented here on the efficacy of remdesivir in prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regimens, the difficulty of coronaviruses to acquire resistance to remdesivir , and the availability of human safety data warrant testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. Our results, together with replication inhibition by remdesivir of a wide range of coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo, may further indicate utility of remdesivir against the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China.\u201d\n\nThe monkeys who took part in the experiment were euthanized shortly after the study was completed.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/25112650-0-image-a-4_1582534920655.jpg", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/02/scientists-infect-monkeys-with-coronavirus-in-search-of-a-cure-for-covid-19.html", "title": "Scientists Infect Monkeys With Coronavirus in Search of a Cure for COVID-19", "description": "Researchers around the world are taking different approaches to develop a cure or vaccine for the illness as it continues to spread across the planet.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:section": "Science & Tech", "updated_time": "2020-02-24T15:05:04-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/25112650-0-image-a-4_1582534920655.jpg", "image:width": "1908", "image:height": "1146", "image:alt": "Monkeys", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2020-02-24T15:03:56-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-02-24T15:05:04-06:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://themindunleashed.com/", "https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/12/1922083117", "https://themindunleashed.com/author/johnvibestmu", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/02/scientists-infect-monkeys-with-coronavirus-in-search-of-a-cure-for-covid-19.html", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["John Vibes"], "publish_date": "2020-02-24T15:03:56-06:00"}
