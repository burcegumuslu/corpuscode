In order to enter the country, Canada requires at least two doses of an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna), or one dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

Cora did not specify which players would be inactive for the Toronto series later, though he said there were \u201cmultiple.\u201d\n\nHouck opted to share his vaccination when the asked about the mandate and his thoughts on the matter, confirming he will be among the inactive players.\n\nSeveral MLB players have opted not to play in Toronto this season. Over this past weekend\u2019s series, the Oakland Athletics were without three unvaccinated players.\n\nThe Red Sox pitcher was disappointed that the vaccine mandate would cost him his start. \u201cI\u2019m definitely bummed that I won\u2019t be able to make that start,\u201d Houck said. \u201cBut the starts that I am able to make, I plan on giving 100 percent for this team, if not more so. Anything I can do for this team to help them win, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nHouck has made two starts since the new season began, including a scoreless outing against the Minnesota Twins where he went 5\u2154 innings.\n\nRELATED: NBA Legend Shaquille O\u2019Neal Says COVID Vaccines Should Not Be Forced", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'I Think it's a Personal Choice': Red Sox Pitcher to Miss Toronto Series Over Canada's Vaccine Mandate", "description": "Tanner Houck, a right-handed pitcher who will be one of \"multiple\" inactive Red Sox players, said\u00a0the vaccine should be a \"personal choice.\"", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/i-think-its-a-personal-choice-red-sox-pitcher-to-miss-toronto-series-over-canadas-vaccine-mandate/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-04-18T22:39:34+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-04-19T13:00:49+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Red-Sox-Pitcher-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Canada", "Tanner Houck", "vaccine mandates", "MLB", "Boston Red Sox"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/04/17/sports/red-sox-pitcher-tanner-houck-indicates-hes-not-vaccinated-wont-be-able-start-toronto-next-week/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/phil-jackson-slams-the-nba-for-going-woke-says-he-couldnt-watch-social-justice-themed-games/", "https://nationalfile.com/white-woke-evangelicals-triggered-by-tweet/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/nba-legend-shaquille-oneal-says-covid-vaccines-not-forced/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/boston-red-sox/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/canada/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/mlb/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/tanner-houck/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-mandates/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-04-18T22:39:34+00:00"}
