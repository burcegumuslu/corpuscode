Called Operation Jenner, 2,200 high profile people in Spain, including politicians, medical people and the head of a Spanish pharma company, have been found to have bought vaccination certificates while avoiding vaccination itself. Here is one story from May 24, titled OPERATION JENNER | The president of the largest pharmaceutical company in Spain, in the plot of the false vaccinated against the coronavirus.\n\nTwitter has carried an Operation Jenner link: see #OperationJenner\n\nThe report below runs an updated version first, followed by the original story. First, a selection of tweets.\n\n\u201cSpanish police\u2026Operation Jenner\u2026uncovered a \u2018vast network of celebrities and elites who have paid money to have their names fraudulently entered on the National Immunisation Register, despite refusing to be vaccinated\u2019.\u201d https://t.co/pqcBKiKq4N\n\nIf you don\u2019t think this was happening in every country, you\u2019re gullible. In time, I think we\u2019ll find even some of our politicians who demanded mandates faked their vaccinations. #operationjenner https://t.co/jdvAEV6qT6\n\nAnd we bumped into this report from France 24 (Aussie tennis star de Minaur investigated over false Covid pass purchase scheme) from February of this year, indicating that Operation Jenner has been running since January. The leaders of the scheme are based in France. If you do a Google search for Operation Jenner Spain, surprisingly little comes up.\n\nReaction to the news that more than 2,200 prominent Spaniards, including the leader of one of the country\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies, has been one of resignation and disbelief.\n\nSince the story broke on May 24, people have been asking how this could happen. But they have also been asking how it is that reaction to the news has been muted, almost accepting that this is what happens.\n\nIn the words of one Twitter user Starfish: \u201cWhy NOBODY here talks about the operation Jenner, discovered in Spain, why don\u2019t they go further in the investigation?\u201d\n\nThe reality is that the investigation is still ongoing with more evidence being collected before many of those go to trial, but perhaps it is more that this was not unexpected.\n\nWhilst the average Spaniard did as the government asked, obeyed the rules and went out and got vaccinated, others thought they were above the law, that they were somehow special.\n\nWhat is disconcerting, is that many of these people are involved in professions that meant a high level of contact with others. Essentially, they cared so little for those around them, they did not bother to ensure that those they came into contact with were kept safe and free from Covid-19.\n\nBut perhaps the bigger issue is that the level of trust is broken, that a company president involved in researching Covid-19 vaccines did not feel it necessary or important to get vaccinated leads many to ask whether vaccinations were necessary or safe.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the police did not uncover the scam through a local investigation, but rather through efforts to curb extremism on the dark web.\n\nEnter policeman A, his name has not been made public. According to the Guardia Civil, he made contact with an extremist Islamic group whom he arranged to meet in France, but told them that he personally could not travel as he had not been vaccinated.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t have a COVID-19 passport; I am not vaccinated. Allah does not allow me to put anything impure in my body.\u201d\n\nThey replied that they could get him a passport and even get him registered on the National Registry of Vaccination. He was introduced to two Madrid residents, \u00c1lex, a former thief with a history of sexual assault and known to have contact with criminals in Madrid, and Irene, an attractive woman who had been convicted and then pardoned for drug trafficking many years ago.\n\nThe police followed the two and noticed that Irene met a young man twice a week, after hours. That young man turned out to be Mario, a nursing assistant in the Hospital of La Paz.\n\nAn investigation online found that Mario was an active militant and a Covid-19 denier, which made them suspicious. But on checking, they found he could not be the source of the false certificates as he would not have access to the database.\n\nSo they went about pretending to be potential customers to gather the evidence they needed. What they found was another nurse was being given a share to issue the certificates, with the money being put into cryptocurrency accounts to try and hide it.\n\nBut they also did spend it, drawing further attention to themselves, with the network growing and the number of customers increasing.\n\nIn the end, the police arrested 15 people involved in the selling and issuing of false certificates.\n\nWhat makes this case even more bizarre is that Mario contracted Covid-19 and need to be vaccinated to be able to return to work, but he couldn\u2019t do that as a denier. So that\u2019s when he approached his would be accomplice, who helped him out. It was at that point, Mario realised that they could make money offering the false certificates.\n\nPerhaps the political shenanigans, the Ukraine war and the rising cost of living has pushed this story into the background a little more than it should have. But it is likely to run as more and more names become public knowledge.\n\nThe \u201cJenner Operation\u201d has uncovered at least 2,200 famous people with false Covid-19 vaccination certificates after these were bought from a nurse.\n\nAmongst those that have been investigated are leading singers, musicians, football stars, business people, politicians and top medical personnel.\n\nThe scandal involved people being added to the National Immunisation Registry in exchange for money, with many of them familiar faces and household names.\n\nThe latest of these to be charged is the President of PharmaMar Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Sousa-Faro, an IBEX 35 company, and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Spain. The company is dedicated to researching drugs including cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s and yes, Covid-19.\n\nThe 76-year-old businessman, who has not yet been summoned to testify, was included in the lists to reflect that he had received the third dose.\n\nThe leader of the network was a nursing assistant at the La Paz University Hospital, where he is accused of charging more than \u20ac200,000 euros for fraudulently registering 2,200 people as vaccinated in the National Registry against Covid-19. He has been arrested and is currently in custody.\n\nAmong those accused are Bruno Gonz\u00e1lez Cabrera, a defender who played for Betis, Getafe, Levante and Valladolid. Fabio D\u00edez Steinaker in beach volleyball, runner-up in Europe and fifth in the Sydney Olympic Games. The former Valencian boxer and wrestler Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapater, alias Tit\u00edn, who starred in more than a thousand fights.\n\nThe famous people invesitaged so far includes: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Sousa-Faro, President of PharmaMar \u2013 Trinitario Casanova, one of the richest men in Spain \u2013 Kidd Keo, rap singer in English and Spanish \u2013 Anier, rap singer \u2013 Jarfaiter, rap singer \u2013 Veronica Echegui, actress \u2013 Bruno Gonzalez Cabrera, soccer player \u2013 Fabio D\u00edez Steinaker, former beach volleyball Olympian \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapater, alias Tit\u00edn, former boxer \u2013 Camilo Esquivel, recognized and prestigious doctor.\n\nAccording to the police who are investigating the 2,200 over false Covid-19 vaccination certificates, the fee was dependent on your social standing. The more important you were, the higher the price.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "Over 2,000 High Profile Spanish Paid for Fake Vaccine Certificates Including Pharma Head | The Liberty Beacon", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/over-2000-high-profile-spanish-paid-for-fake-vaccine-certificates-including-pharma-head/", "article:published_time": "2022-05-29T11:00:35+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-29T11:01:16+00:00"}, "tags": ["Pam Barker", "Peter McLaren Kennedy euroweekly", "Spanish national registry against Covid", "Jose Maria Fernandez Sousa-Faro PharmaMar", "Operation Jenner", "Spain 2 200 fake vaccine certs", "Europe Reloaded"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://euroweeklynews.com/2022/02/16/spanish-actress-investigated-for-buying-fraudulent-covid-pass/", "https://euroweeklynews.com/2022/05/27/2200-prominent-spanish-personalties-investigated-for-false-covid-19-vaccination/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-05-29T11:00:35+00:00"}
