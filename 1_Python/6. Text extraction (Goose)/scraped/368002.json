Because of yearly variances an optimal vaccination time can\u2019t be predicted, but for most adults, seeking vaccination in September or October addresses the possibility of an early flu season. For those over 65 or with compromised immune systems, waiting to get inoculated until at least mid-September helps assure the protective effect of the shot will last through the entire flu season. Vaccination later than that is better than never since the flu season often peaks in February. Be aware that you can catch the flu after having the shot, but chances are that your course of illness will be less severe than it would be if you skipped the vaccine. Many pharmacies nationwide already have the vaccine in stock.\n\nFlu Vaccine, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm#anchor_1591373186513\n\nMore current health news from this week\u2019s bulletin:\n\u2022 Are You Getting Enough Vitamin C?\n\n\n\nSign up for more Dr. Weil newsletters:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ready For Your Flu Shot? | Weekly Bulletins | Andrew Weil, M.D.", "description": "The timing is important \u2013 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting your shot September or October in advance of the flu season.", "url": "https://www.drweil.com/blog/bulletins/ready-for-your-flu-shot/", "site_name": "DrWeil.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DrWeil", "article:modified_time": "2020-09-01T22:07:18+00:00", "image": "https://www.drweil.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/01141310/Ready-For-Your-Flu-Shot-WB-1250234428.jpg", "image:width": "1440", "image:height": "1080", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.drweil.com/", "https://www.drweil.com/blog/", "https://www.drweil.com/blog/bulletins/", "https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/heart/cardiovascular-disease/", "https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/allergy-asthma/asthma/", "https://www.drweil.com/blog/bulletins/are-you-getting-enough-vitamin-c/", "https://www.drweil.com/blog/bulletins/is-your-vegetarian-diet-healthy/", "https://www.drweil.com/diet-nutrition/recipes/garlic-broth/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "September 1, 2020"}
