It proposed the use of biotechnology to \u201caid\u201d human health, citing the role of such biotechnologies during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the vital role of biotechnology and biomanufacturing in developing and producing life-saving diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines that protect Americans and the world,\u201d the EO stated. \u201cThe power of these technologies is most vivid at the moment in the context of human health.\u201d\n\nGiven this, EO 14081 called on the secretary of health and human services to \u201csubmit a report assessing how to use biotechnology \u2026 to achieve medical breakthroughs, reduce the overall burden of disease, and improve health outcomes.\u201d According to the edict, the report \u201cshall identify high-priority basic research and technology development needs \u2026 [alongside] recommendations for actions to enhance biosafety and biosecurity to reduce risk throughout the biotechnology R&D and biomanufacturing lifecycles.\u201d\n\nThe EO also mandated the establishment of a \u201cData for the Bioeconomy Initiative,\u201d which requires \u201cbiological data sets\u201d \u2013 including gene-related information deemed critical for social advances. In line with this, it called for a \u201cplan to fill any data gaps\u201d and to \u201cmake new and existing public data findable and \u201caccessible.\u201d\n\nEO 14081 tried to allay the fears of critics by implementing a \u201cdata-protection plan\u201d to mitigate security and privacy risks. However, the initiative raises the question of whether and how individuals\u2019 genomic information might be publicly disclosed, and whether it would be done so only with informed consent.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s call for the \u2018programming\u2019 of biology the way we program software, if applied to humans, would facilitate [the] transhumanist vision of the creation of \u2018superhumans\u2019 through various kinds of technology, including biotechnology,\u201d wrote Emily Mangiaracina for LifeSiteNews.\n\nBiden\u2019s transhumanist EO 14081 oddly echoed the concept of hackable humans promoted by Israeli intellectual Yuval Noah Harari.\n\n\u201cToday, we have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale,\u201d said Harari, a lead advisor for the World Economic Forum (WEF). \u201cEverything is being digitalized [and] monitored.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harari, the pandemic serves as a chance to bring hackable humans closer to reality thanks to the COVID-19 vaccines, which he branded as tools to facilitate \u201csurveillance under the skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vaccine will help us, of course. It will make things more manageable, [such as] surveillance. People could look back in a hundred years and identify the [COVID-19] pandemic as the moment when a regime of surveillance took over \u2013 especially surveillance under the skin,\u201d he said. (Related: Yuval Noah Harari: Humans are now HACKABLE ANIMALS thanks to vaccines.)\n\n\u201cThis ability to hack human beings, to go under the skin, collect biometric data, analyze it and understand people better than they understand themselves \u2026 is the most important event of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nDuring a separate lecture, the WEF advisor explained how this ability to hack humans can be achieved.\n\n\u201cBiological knowledge, multiplied by computing power, multiplied by data \u2013 equals the ability to hack humans. If you know enough biology and you have enough computing power and data \u2013 you can hack my body, my brain and my life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the past, many tyrants and governments wanted to do it. But nobody understood biology well enough, and nobody had enough computing power and data to hack millions of people. Neither the Gestapo nor the KGB could do it. But soon, at least some corporations and governments will be able to systematically hack all the people.\u201d\n\nWatch Yuval Noah Harari discuss the transhumanist concept of hackable humans below.\n\nThis video is from the Thrivetime Show channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nGlobalists push transhumanism agenda with computer chips inserted into humans via COVID injections.\n\nLet\u2019s Talk America: Democrats, globalists tearing down the US to \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nThrive Time Show: Covid vaccines part of bigger plan to ELIMINATE free will \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nWEF lead advisor Harari: Humans are now hackable animals; free will is over \u2013 Brighteon.TV.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden\u2019s transhumanist EO calls for natural biology to be programmed like computers", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2022-09-21-biden-transhumanist-eo-program-biology-like-computers.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "An executive order (EO) by President Joe Biden called\u00a0for natural biology to be programmed \u201clike computers\u201d \u2013 a clear push for transhumanism under the guise of public health.
