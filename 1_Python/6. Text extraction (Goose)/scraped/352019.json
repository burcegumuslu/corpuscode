She was nearly killed by DC police officers during the rally. Victoria was later arrested and charged with assault on the US Capitol.\n\u2022 Victoria White was brutally beaten near death by the US Capitol Police.\n\n According to attorney Joseph McBride: She is hit approximately thirty- five times over the course of 4 minutes and 30 seconds, while appearing to be begging for mercy the entire time. She is hit with the baton while facing away. She is hit with the baton while facing forward. She is speared and poked with the baton about the face so as to inflict maximum pain. She collapses more than once and is stood up by the officers only to be maced and beaten again.\n\u2022 ** Her DOJ report is here.\n\n Not once in the DOJ report do they describe the brutal pummeling she received at the hands of the Capitol Police officers.\n\u2022 The fact that they ignored the police brutality in their report is absolutely frightening. Here is the shocking description of her attack released Wednesday by Attorney Joseph McBride. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) commander Jason Bagshaw is the officer who brutally beat a female Trump supporter including bashing her several times in the face on January 6th. Bagshaw recently shot and killed a man while he was at dinner with his wife. Zachary Stieber and Joseph M. Hanneman at The Epoch Times reported: The Washington D.C. police officer who beat a Minnesota woman with a metal baton at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is a 19-year veteran with a history of use-of-force complaints.\n\nSo who is the individual in charge of investigation of the pipe bomb. Jason Bagshaw. So this is the same guy that beat victoria in the tunnel\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t prosecuted for the emails? Put simply, Obama ultimately OK\u2019d by using the non govt email addy to communicate w/ Clinton. Obama also had an alias along with each of his cabinet members. Therefore indicting would lead to indicting Obama & his cabinet etc which could never happen. Remember he lied about knowing but that ultimately came out in the dump. Poof!\n\nFollow Huma.\n\n What just broke w/ Huma?\n\n What did instruct Huma to do re: Classified markings? To mark them unclassified -\u201cstrip them, turn them into non-paper and send\u201d via an unsecure channel to end up on Hillary\u2019s server, open for the world to access \n\n Why is this story just now coming out?\n\n What relevance does it have?Why is Donna running for cover?\n\n Was a deal granted in exchange for something?\n\n Who made the deal?\n\n Do we care about Donna or those who instructed her to violate the law?\n\n Why is this being leaked v. simply prosecuted privately?\n\n Who is attempting to change the narrative and soften the acts that are forthcoming this weekend? What did HRC instruct Huma to do re: Classified markings? To mark them unclassified -\u201cstrip them, turn them into non-paper and send\u201d via an unsecure channel to end up on Hillary\u2019s server, open for the world to access Why is this story just now coming out? -Certain events had to occur first \u2013 Hillary\u2019s benefactors/owners in KSA had to be taken out of circulation and held incommunicado so there would be no protection for her (or funds available to escape, bribe, etc.) -The noose is closing in. Avenues of escape for other affiliated actors are being closed. What relevance does it have? It\u2019s a serious crime to both order it and to carry it out. -Shows INTENT -contradicts Comey\u2019s validation for not pursuing HRC prior to the primaries Why is Donna running for cover? She has a clue what\u2019s coming and she doesn\u2019t want to go to jail, so she made a deal. -Protection has been removed for some people (J Podesta, HRC), Donna doesn\u2019t have clean hands and is culpable. Those who were above her are being toppled. Was a deal granted in exchange for something? Probably the DOJ if it involved an immunity agreement. Do we care about Donna or those who instructed her to violate the law? Those who instructed her to violate the law. -If it can lead to those higher up, yes. RULE OF LAW. Why is this being leaked v. simply prosecuted privately? -To soften the left\u2019s outrage. -Messages from one party to another, one faction to another: there is no more cover. Who is attempting to change the narrative and soften the acts that are forthcoming this weekend? NY times, WP stories about the \u201cfallen Podesta Brothers\u201d plural\u2026\u2026.. 10.17.17 The Hill and CIRCA release U1 story. 11.1.17 Brazille reveals primary was rigged. 11.2.17 Warren confirms on CNN that primary was rigged. 11.2.17 Blitzer on CNN asks direct question of Andre Carson if primary was rigged (He waffles).\n\n 11.2.17 WaPo gives four pinnochios to Dems for lying about Tax Bill. 11.3.17 CNN interviews Sanders campaign manager who confirms \u2018rigged\u2019. 11.3.17 Tulsi Gabbard confirms primary was rigged.\n\n 11.3.17 Newsweek does article on primary being rigged. 11.3.17 MSNBC asks Schumer if primary was rigged\u2026. WITNESSING A SEA CHANGE Why is a priority?\n\n Could people pay such gangs to kill opponents and why / how to insulate against exposure?\n\n The truth is mind blowing and cannot fully be exposed. These people are evil.\n\n Why wasn\u2019t prosecuted for the emails? \n\n Put simply, Obama ultimately OK\u2019d by using the non govt email addy to communicate w/ Clinton. Obama also had an alias along with each of his cabinet members. Therefore indicting would lead to indicting Obama & his cabinet etc which could never happen. \n\n Remember he lied about knowing but that ultimately came out in the dump. Poof!\n\n Snow White\n\n Godfather III\n\n Q\n\u2022 I\u2019m a big fan of Lee Smith (the BIGGEST!), and agree with him. I would like to add that I also believe they were looking for, and thought I had, some or all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton 33,000 emails that were deleted, acid washed, and phones hammered AFTER the receipt of a full Congressional SUBPOENA.
