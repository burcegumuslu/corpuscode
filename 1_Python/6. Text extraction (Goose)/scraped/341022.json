Reviewing Some Possible Unintended Consequences of the mRNA Vaccines Against COVID-19\u201d.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript note their discussions on Tuesday, wherein they examined the remarks given by family physician Dr. Dan Stock to his local school board in a video gone viral, the significance of which saw him truthfully explaining that animal hosted viruses like Covid can never be eradicated unless you wipe out every animal on earth\u2014a factual reality about viruses being ignored by health authorities in Australia, who\u2019ve just ordered their locked down citizens to stop talking to each other and are threatening to call in more military troops to enforce their lockdown\u2014while in America, yesterday it saw former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger telling anti-maskers \u201cScrew Your Freedom!\u201d\u2014though to be noted, just last week it saw socialist leader Biden\u2019s top Covid advisor admitting the truth that the masks Americans are wearing are useless.\n\nWhile viewing this insane socialist Covid hypocrisy, Security Council Members in this transcript take special notice of French-Canadian political strategist Rachel Marsden, who was kicked out of her own country under threat of imprisonment when she tried to fly home to Canada for a visit last week\u2014was ejected from her own country under threat of imprisonment because her proof of immunity to Covid came in the form of naturally acquired antibodies rather than from an injection\u2014which she called \u201cthe beginning of the end of freedom in so-called democracies\u201d then asked: \u201cWhich freedom-loving country will become the first to offer asylum to refugees fleeing draconian Covid regimes?\u201d.\n\nThis transcript sees Chairwoman Valentina Matviyenko answering Ms Marsden\u2019s question of which country will be the first to grant asylum to those seeking freedom from socialist Covid tyranny by noting that the Russia Federation has already enacted such laws\u2014the first being the Law On The Far Eastern Hectare, that gives 1-hectare (2.5-acres) of free land in the Russian Far East to foreign nationals as long as they live there for five years\u2014and as of 1 June, was joined with the Arctic Hectare Programme, that also gives 1-hectare plots of free land to any foreigner seeking freedom, as long as they live on it for 5-years and emigrate to Russia.\n\nThis transcript concludes with Security Council Members discussing the likelihood of Americans escaping socialist tyranny for Russian freedom\u2014Americans who should know that Russia is one of the very few countries that actively encourages immigration, and in 2020 ranked 4th in immigration among all nations\u2014while in the United States, these Americans see themselves being ruled over by Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden, who yesterday sexually groped yet another young terrified girl child, then saw him confusing Michigan Governor Whitmer with his Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm\u2014after which Biden then begged OPEC to increase its oil output to combat the rising gas prices in America due to his destroying his own nation\u2019s energy production\u2014today sees Biden\u2019s deranged socialist policies having slammed on America producer prices that have soared to 7.8% annually, the most on record\u2014deranged and destructive policies that explain why socialist Democrat Party leader House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is watching in terror as her majority crumbles as more of her members announce their retirement ahead of the coming 2022 Republican Party tsunami that will take back the US Congress\u2014all of which is occurring in the shadow of the just published startling article \u201cNEW POLL: As August 13 Deadline Nears, Almost a THIRD of Republicans Think Trump Will Be \u2018Reinstated\u2019 as President This Year\u201d\u2014which President Donald Trump quickly responded to by posting a cryptic three-word message to the American people saying: \u201cBULLIES NEVER FIGHT!\u201d.
