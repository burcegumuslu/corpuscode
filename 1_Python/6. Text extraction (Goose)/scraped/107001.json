And yes, there are more alternatives than you\u2019d imagine! Here are some of the best\n\nBack in the 1970s, a naive and rather irresponsible researcher, Herb Terrace, launched , a study on teaching chimps sign language and documented it on film. But what should have been an interesting and heartwarming story of human-ape interaction soon turned into a horror movie. After having raised baby chimp Nim as a little human and taught him how to sign, Terrace passed the communicative primate on to other researchers after he bit one of his trainers on the face. The end result: Nim ended up in the Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Surgery In Primates (LEMSIP), where he was brutally used to test medicines for humans.\n\nAs you can imagine, after having eaten at a dining table with people, played with human children and even being given his own kitten, being subjected to painful medical experiments and living in a cage was nothing short of nightmarish for poor Nim.\n\nMore recently, \u2018Puppygate\u2019 \u2013 where Dr Anthony Fauci paid for puppies to have their faces eaten off by sandflies \u2013 made people even more aware of why we need to stop animal testing now.\n\nAnimal testing has been a contentious issue for decades. Back in 1959, scientists William Russell and Rex Burch first described the basic principles behind the ethics surrounding animal testing, known as the\n\u2022 Reduction: the use of methods that provide researchers with comparable amounts of data from fewer animals, or more data from the same number of animals\n\u2022 Refinement: the use of methods that minimize potential for animal pain, suffering and distress and maximize animal welfare\n\u2022 Replacement: the use of non-animal subjects wherever possible\n\nBut those 3 Rs were \u2013 and are \u2013 largely ignored. Consequently, animal activists have called for an outright ban on vivisection (a.k.a. animal testing). Lately, animal activists have been winning battles, with public support for animal rights having risen steadily in the last decade . Consequently, the US National Institute of Health has . But that\u2019s not good enough.\n\nSome governments also support animal rights, to an extent. In 2013, the European Union banned the testing of finished cosmetic products and cosmetic ingredients on animals. But the EU hasn\u2019t outright banned animal testing for scientific purposes. It has passed legislation that them in such cases, under the auspices of the 3 R\u2019s mentioned above. And as we know, those Rs are often ignored.\n\nYears ago, Barack Obama signed a revised Toxic Substances Control Act with a provision to restrict animal testing in drug experiments. And a group of regulatory bodies from the US, Canada, Brazil, Japan and the EU jointly called the International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation (ICCR), is working toward the elimination of cosmetic animal testing while offering alternatives (e.g.,\n\nWhat may surprise you is the fact that neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission requires that cosmetics or household products be tested on animals at all. So if activists and various governments are on board, and if animal testing isn\u2019t even required half the time, why does it persist? And persist it does. According to a study in the Indian Journal of Pharmacology , a whopping fifty to a hundred million animals are used worldwide in scientific experiments each year.\n\nThe main reason animal testing continues is, of course, corporate resistance from Big Pharma. Animal testing is one of the cheapest, fastest and easiest ways for them to get a drug to market. Another reason is the scientific community\u2019s stubborn conservatism. For decades, researchers have relied on animal testing, so it\u2019s comfortable and easy, as results can be must overcome bureaucratic hurdles before being implemented.\n\nSome scientists insist that certain conditions such as blindness and high blood pressure can\u2019t be studied in non-animal subjects like bacteria and tissue cultures. They also make the rather spurious claim that animal testing is the best way to bring benefits to animal as well as human health. They cite the need for animal testing for the development of vaccines for diseases such as rabies, feline leukemia and heartworm. Overall, the conservative camp will tell you that any alternatives to animal testing are years of research and development away from practical reality. But is this just the rhetoric of the invested?\n\nWhile animal testing may be the more comfortable and familiar option, it\u2019s also unreliable. And in many cases, it\u2019s inaccurate, unnecessary, and cruel (hello, Dr Fauci!) Few recognise how testing on animals in distress is the kind of shoddy science that can skew results. It\u2019s hard to imagine how animals such as chimps or dogs kept in small cages over long periods of time can\n\nAs for reliability, we need to stop animal testing because its results are often inapplicable to humans. Compounds that seem to be safe in animals may be toxic to humans, and vice versa. Don\u2019t forget you can actually a dog by feeding it chocolate, but we humans love it! The US Food and Drug Administration itself that up to ninety percent of drugs that pass animal testing fail when administered to humans.\n\nAnd by \u201cfailing\u201d they mean the drug either doesn\u2019t work or is downright dangerous. Differences between species, and even between animals of the same species, can produce unreliable results due to variances in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of chemicals.\n\n, used in cosmetic testing, often experience skin redness, bleeding, ulcers and even blindness. That\u2019s the price rabbits pay for a mere sixty-percent prediction rate of skin irritation in humans. What\u2019s more, certain alternative skin-test methods, such as those done on human volunteers, are much better. These are up to eighty-six percent accurate. Keep in mind that drug testing results even vary on humans, depending on their age, gender and race. But these factors are rarely, if ever, considered when doing drug testing.\n\nNot Even Necessary\n\nAnother reason to stop animal testing is because it\u2019s not even necessary. Despite common belief, not every breakthrough in medical history has required animal testing. For example? While the discovery of insulin therapy is said to have relied on the removal of dogs\u2019 pancreases, that\u2019s not entirely true. The real research legwork had been done earlier in observations of human patients. Or consider that the best location for electrodes to be placed in the brain for the Parkinson\u2019s treatment known as Deep Brain Stimulation was first identified not through research on monkeys, but decades earlier, through brain surgery on human patients.\n\nrequire animal testing, there can be little doubt that in most cases researchers should be looking to stop animal testing now. Given that animals are just as sentient as we are, it\u2019s simply barbaric.\n\nthat are potentially far more effective in determining toxicity effects on humans from new drugs or chemicals. Many organisations fund the exploration and development of such alternatives, including: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods\n\nThe most common alternatives that could stop animal testing are listed below.\n\nmethods aren\u2019t yet widely used, and are still being evaluated. But early returns suggest greater accuracy of data than that provided by promising culture has already inspired progress in treatments of AIDS, cancers, sepsis and kidney disease. It is already regularly used in chemical safety testing, vaccine production and drug development.\n\ntesting ground consists of what is called a 3D \u201chuman skin equivalent,\u201d such as . These anatomy models allow for an assessment of allergic reactions without any harm coming to cute little creatures like guinea pigs and rabbits. In a nod to corporate responsibility, cosmetic company L\u2019Oreal has partnered with SkinEthic to conceive of one particular model called Episkin.\n\nAnother example is the organ-on-a-chip program that many labs are exploring . These devices mimic human organs such as kidney, lung and heart, on which drugs and chemicals are tested for toxicity. Responses are measured via electric signals. Cells can survive and function on chips for several weeks, in some cases, allowing for many different experiments to be done. The ultimate goal is to replicate an entire human on a chip. And that goal is getting closer every day.\n\nmethods, the use of human embryonic stem cells on which to trial toxicity and other effects of new drugs may yield quicker and more accurate results than those predicted by animal testing.\n\nHeart, ocular and other human tissues can be replicated from stem cells. These are then exposed to developmental-stage drugs in order to monitor stem cell behavior. Researchers watch carefully for key changes.\n\nThe theory is that exposure to toxic substances may alter concentrations of the stem cell molecules, thus disrupting cell-to-cell interactions. This, in turn, produces a \u201cbiological cascade\u201d that may lead to potential developmental disorders. Stem cell testing of this type is a new concept, so more research is needed to determine whether the approach is viable and trustworthy. Especially on a system as complex as the human body.\n\n) models allow for testing of new drugs and treatments. Researchers have developed several sophisticated of human biology. These include heart, lung, kidney, skin, musculoskeletal and digestive systems on which they can track progression of developing diseases. Early indicate these simulations can reliably predict how trial drugs interact with the body. This is one of the best alternatives to help us stop animal testing.\n\nmethods that produce accurate estimates of a substance\u2019s hazard potential to humans, basing estimates on comparisons to existing substances and our understanding of human biology. Another type is brain-imaging technology, which allows researchers to see inside the brain to study the progression and treatment of brain diseases on volunteer subjects. The results can then be compared to healthy volunteers.\n\nWhat better way to eliminate animal testing than to instead test drugs on human volunteers? The practice of consists of giving volunteer subjects a tiny, one-time dose of a drug to assess how the drug behaves in the body. This can be done via advanced imaging techniques. Microdosing helps to screen out compounds that won\u2019t work on humans. While microdosing offers details about , it offers no information about toxicity or toxicology. This could be measured on stem cells, though.\n\nAnother way for human volunteers to help stop animal testing is through organ and tissue donations from surgeries and post-mortems. These donations can be used in the same ways as tissues developed mature tissues (unlike those grown in a lab), they offer a more reliable response to stimuli.\n\nLifelike human-patient simulators have replaced animal test subjects in ninety-seven percent of US medical schools. These high-tech simulators breathe, bleed, convulse, talk and even die. They mimic illnesses and injuries, providing accurate biological responses in medical interventions and introduction of medications.\n\nFor example, the system replicates a breathing, bleeding human torso, with multiple layers of skin and tissue as well as internal organs. It teaches emergency surgical techniques without the need to cut into live dogs, pigs or goats. Generally, human-patient simulators are better teaching aids for physiology and pharmacology students than exercises in which animals are cut up.\n\nFrom governments, researchers and animal activists alike, much support exists for seeking alternative methods to animal testing. After all, why expose animals to unnecessary suffering? The biggest argument from the anti-alternatives camp is: the human body is too complex for simulations and The perfect rebuttal for this argument, of course, is: ecessity is the mother of invention! Who knows what is possible until the only choice is to try something else?\n\nSources used for this article\n\nDo you agree we need to stop animal testing now?
