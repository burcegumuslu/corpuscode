The CDC continues to recommend vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine for all authorized ages and indications.\u201d\n\nFox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel said that this isn\u2019t \u201cproof\u201d of a link between the vaccine and strokes.\n\n\u201cThis is not proof. This is that they see there may be a link here, and they want to investigate it, and they\u2019re trying to be transparent,\u201d he said.", "opengraph": {"article:opinion": "false", "article:content_tier": "free", "type": "article", "title": "CDC investigating whether Pfizer COVID vaccine increases stroke risk for people over 65", "url": "https://nypost.com/2023/01/14/cdc-investigating-pfizer-covid-vaccine-for-stroke-risk/", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that a preliminary\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine\u00a0\u201csafety signal\u201d has been identified and is investigating whether the Bivalent Pfizer-BioNTe\u2026", "article:published_time": "2023-01-14T17:39:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-14T17:39:23+00:00", "site_name": "New York Post", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "locale": "en_US", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/NYPICHPDPICT000004918704.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "image:secure_url": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/NYPICHPDPICT000004918704.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nypost"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "vaccines", "cdc", "COVID vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://foxnews.com", "https://www.foxnews.com/health/fear-flu-flare-ups-holidays-didnt-happen-says-cdc", "https://www.foxnews.com/video/6318676038112", "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bible-quiz-how-much-know-bible-test", "https://nypost.com/2023/01/12/moderna-under-fire-for-400-price-hike-for-its-covid-vaccine/", "https://nypost.com/2022/10/21/pfizer-says-covid-19-vaccine-will-cost-110-130-per-dose/", "https://nypost.com/2023/01/14/omicron-subvariant-xbb-1-5-possibly-more-likely-to-infect-the-vaccinated-officials/", "https://nypost.com/2023/01/14/omicron-subvariant-xbb-1-5-possibly-more-likely-to-infect-the-vaccinated-officials/", "https://nypost.com/2023/01/14/omicron-subvariant-xbb-1-5-possibly-more-likely-to-infect-the-vaccinated-officials/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-01-14T17:39:12+00:00"}
