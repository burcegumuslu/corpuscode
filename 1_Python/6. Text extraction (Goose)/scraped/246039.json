Little known NIH regulations let agency scientists collect up to $150,000.00 annually in royalties from vaccines upon which they worked. These rules are recipes for regulatory corruption.\n\nNIH\u2019s stake in the jab may explain why Anthony Fauci moved Moderna\u2019s vaccine to the front of the line and to let Moderna skip animal trials despite the experimental technology and the inherent dangers of Coronavirus vaccines. Every prior coronavirus vaccine has proven problematic and can be lethal to animals due to COVID\u2019s unique penchant for \u201cpathogenic priming.\u201d Death occurs only after a vaccinated animal encounters the wild virus.\n\nPublic health advocates and scientists criticized Fauci\u2019s decision to skip animal trials as reckless. It may also explain why Anthony Fauci arranged a $483 million grant to Moderna from a sister NIH agency, BARDA, despite the fact that Moderna has never brought a product to market or gotten approval.\n\nFauci\u2019s infusion made Moderna CEO Steve Bancel a billionaire and further enriched Fauci\u2019s mentor and co-investor Bill Gates. It may also explain why Fauci publicly announced he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Moderna\u2019s catastrophic Phase 1 clinical trials despite the fact that 20{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of the high dose and 6{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of the low dose groups of super healthy volunteers had Grade 3 \u201csevere or medically significant\u201d reactions following vaccination. Those results would have spelled DOA for any other medical product. After getting the abysmal news, Bancel and four other Moderna executives immediately dumped more than $89 million in stock and Fauci was forced to make his optimistic public assessment to save Moderna\u2019s plummeting shares from death spiral.\n\nFauci painted lipstick on that lame donkey and now he\u2019s trying to convince everyone it\u2019s a thoroughbred. Moderna and NIH began manufacturing the first of 1 billion doses of the deadly vaccine this month. Fauci knows from experience that no matter how dangerous a vaccine, the easy part is convincing people to take it. Pharma, after all, controls the media.\n\nPRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
