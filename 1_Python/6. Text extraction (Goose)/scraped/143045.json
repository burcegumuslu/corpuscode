We are building a strong team of Greenpeace activists who are passionate about Climate Justice and are willing to take direct action with us.\n\nIn the last ten years, conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks have increased in frequency and intensity. The combined effects of these dangers, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a rise in global crisis, hunger and migration. We need to call out governments, financial institutions, and corporations that continue to uphold the systems that exploit this planet and its people.\n\nThe creative, peaceful, and diverse solutions and movements that we can foster through our activism are even more necessary and vital. We need MORE people with the skills and courage to gather and organize. People who want to see big corporations, big banks and big governments held accountable for their role in destroying our planet and our communities. People who are willing to stand up and speak out, who love this world and will work tirelessly to protect it and make it a more just and equitable place for all!\n\nThis is a weekend-long, intensive training to learn and share non-violent direct action skills and tactics including strategy, blockades and visual arts.\n\n\n\nThis training is an opportunity to get together with a diverse group of people who want to tackle environmental and social injustice together. With trainers from across Canada with a range of backgrounds, we strive to provide useful tools for the struggles on the road ahead.\n\nIf you are interested in coming together with other creative, activist-minded folks, honouring diversity, and working across differences, please consider joining us.\n\nToronto (location is accessible by car, bike and TTC)\n\n Exact location and accessibility information will be disclosed to participants only. It will be a scent-reduced environment striving to be scent free..\n\nWe have limited slots, so only selected individuals will be able to attend. You must apply to participate.\n\nThis training is free for all participants, though we would happily accept donations to help cover the high costs of this training.\n\nFood will be provided and we will do our best to accommodate everyone\u2019s dietary restrictions.\n\nPlease let us know if there are any barriers to your participation such as transportation, accommodations, or childcare and we will support you as best as we can!\n\nWe encourage you to send this application to friends and organizers that you trust, so that we can bring together folks in the GTA to build skills and capacity. Please apply as soon as possible and with detail and attention to your responses - and spread the word to those you think would make great activists alongside you.\n\nProof of vaccination required. Please specify if you have a valid medical exemption.\n\nMasks are required for the duration indoors. (There will be opportunities during the weekend for people to spend time outdoors without masks if they can physically distance).\n\nWe will have filters running and plan to eat outside. We want to ensure that everyone is as comfortable as possible and those most vulnerable are protected as much as possible from COVID-19 infection.\n\nApplications for BAT is now closed!\n\nThank you for your interest, but we are no longer accepting applications. The deadline for submission was August 7, 2022.
