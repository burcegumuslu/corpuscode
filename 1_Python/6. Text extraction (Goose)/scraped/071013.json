This divide within the scientific community has left the public wondering who can be trusted to provide them with accurate information and answers. \u2013 James Stafford\n\nEarlier this week, I was interviewed by James Stafford of oil price.com: The Kardashians and Climate Change: Interview with Judith Curry. Excerpts:\n\nOilprice.com: You\u2019ve talked a lot about the role of communication and public relations in the climate change debate. Where do scientists fail in this respect?\n\nJudith Curry: Climate science communication hasn\u2019t been very effective in my opinion. The dominant paradigm seems to be that a science knowledge deficit of the public and policy makers exists, which is exacerbated by the Koch-funded climate denial machine. This knowledge deficit then results in the public failing to act with the urgency that is urged by climate scientists.\n\nThis strategy hasn\u2019t worked for a lot of reasons. The chief one that concerns me as a scientist is that strident advocacy and alarmism is causing the public to lose trust in scientists.\n\nOilprice.com: What is the balance between engagement with the public on this issue and propaganda?\n\nJudith Curry: There are two growing trends in climate science communications \u2013 engagement and propaganda. Engagement involves listening and recognizes that communication is a two-way street. It involves collaboration between scientists, the public and policy makers, and recognizes that the public and policy makers don\u2019t want to be told what to do by scientists. The other trend has been propaganda. The failure of the traditional model of climate science communication has resulted in more exaggeration and alarmism, appeals to authority, appeals to fear, appeals to prejudice, demonizing those that disagree, name-calling, oversimplification, etc.\n\nThere is a burgeoning field of social science research related to science communications. Hopefully this will spur more engagement and less propaganda.\n\nOilprice.com: You\u2019ve also talked about the climate change debate creating a new literary genre. How is this \u2018Cli-Fi\u2019 phenomenon contributing to the intellectual level of the public debate and where do you see this going?\n\nJudith Curry: I am very intrigued by Cli-Fi as a way to illuminate complex aspects of the climate debate. There are several sub-genres emerging in Cli-Fi \u2013 the dominant one seems to be dystopian (e.g. scorched earth). I am personally very interested in novels that involve climate scientists dealing with dilemmas, and also in how different cultures relate to nature and the climate. I think that Cli-Fi is a rich vein to be tapped for fictional writing.\n\nOilprice.com: How would you describe the current intellectual level of the climate change debate?\n\nJudith Curry: Well, the climate change debate seems to be diversifying, as sociologists, philosophers, engineers and scientists from other fields enter the fray. There is a growing realization that the UNFCCC/IPCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change/Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has oversimplified both the problem and its solution. The wicked climate problem is growing increasingly wicked as more and more dimensions come into play. The diversification helps with the confirmation bias and \u2018groupthink\u2019 problem.\n\nHopefully this diversification will lead to greater understanding and policies that are more robust to the deep uncertainties surrounding the climate change problem.\n\nOilprice.com: You\u2019ve also talked about the \u201cKardashian Factor\u201d \u2026 Can you expand on this?\n\nJudith Curry: The Kardashian Factor relates to a scientist\u2019s impact in social media. There is a growing disconnect between scientists who impact within the ivory tower, as measured by publications and citations, versus those scientists that are tweeting and blogging. While some of the smartest people on the planet are university professors, most of them simply don\u2019t matter in today\u2019s great debates. The use of the term \u2018Kardashian Factor\u2019 is designed to marginalize social media impact as shallow popularity.\n\nSocial media is changing the world, and academia hasn\u2019t quite figured out what to do about it. On issues relevant to public debate, social media is rivaling published academic research in its impact. Social media is leveling the playing field and democratizing science. The skills required to be successful in social media include good writing/communication skills and the abilities to synthesize, integrate, and provide context. Those who are most successful at social media also have a sense of humor and can connect to broader cultural issues \u2013 they also develop a trustworthy persona. These are non-trivial skills, and they are general traits of people that have impact.\n\nOilprice.com: Does the current debate seem to lack \u2018layers\u2019 that get lost in the politics and socio-economics?\n\nJudith Curry: The debate is polarized in a black-white yes-no sort of way, which is a consequence of oversimplifying the problem and its solution. Although you wouldn\u2019t think so by listening to the Obama administration on the topic of climate change, the debate is becoming more complex and nuanced. Drivers for the growing number of layers in the climate debate are the implications of the 21st century hiatus in warming, the growing economic realities of attempting to transition away from fossil fuels, and a growing understanding of the clash of values involved.\n\nOilprice.com: How does the media take advantage of every major \u2014 or even semi-major \u2014 weather event to make dire climate forecasts or support one or another polarized side of this debate? Can you give us some recent examples?\n\nJudith Curry: The impact of extreme weather events in raising concern about global warming became apparent following Hurricane Katrina. The psychology of immediate and visible loss is far more salient than hypothetical problems in the next century. Hence extreme weather events have been effectively used in propaganda efforts. This is in spite of the assessment of the IPCC that doesn\u2019t find much evidence linking extreme weather events to global warming, other than heat waves.\n\nOilprice.com: Where should energy fit into the climate change debate, and how much of a concern to the climate is the energy resources drive? Does anyone really know?\n\nJudith Curry: It has never made sense to me for climate change to be the primary driver for energy policy. Even if we believe the climate models, nothing that we do in terms of emissions reductions will have much of an impact on climate until the late 21st century. Energy poverty is a huge issue in much of the world, and there is no obvious way to reconcile reducing CO2 emissions with eradicating energy poverty. Again, this conundrum is evidence of the wickedness of the climate change problem.\n\nMy previous interview with oil price.com can be found at The IPCC May Have Outlived its Usefulness \u2013 An Interview with Judith Curry.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "JC interview with oilprice.com", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2014/08/22/jc-interview-with-oilprice-com/", "description": "by Judith Curry As the global warming debate increases in its intensity we find both sides deeply entrenched, hurling accusations and lies at one another in an attempt to gain the upper hand.
