Yet Pfizer is planning to ask the FDA to authorize a third COVID vaccine shot for healthy kids aged 5-11\u2014and knowing the government, this request will likely be granted, meaning more profits for the vaccine makers and more adverse reactions for kids. This is unacceptable.\n\nNote that this is data neither the government nor Pfizer wanted you to know. The release of hundreds of thousands of pages of documentation from Pfizer\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization application to the FDA is part of a court order that resulted from a Freedom of Information Act request from Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency. The FDA reportedly sought to delay the full release of the documents for 75 years, but the court mandated their release within eight months.\n\nThe FDA released 11,000 pages on April 1st. According to reporting by The Hill, clinical trial data showed no difference in outcome between those who were vaccinated and those previously infected with COVID. None of the trial participants who were vaccinated or previously infected experienced serious clinical outcomes. Natural immunity was also \u201cstatistically identical\u201d to vaccination against infection. But rather than tell the truth\u2014that people previously infected do not need the vaccine\u2014Pfizer spun the narrative, concluding that \u201cfinal efficacy results show that [the vaccine] provided protection against COVID-19 in participants with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the documents reveal that Pfizer was aware that adverse reactions were more frequent and more severe in younger age groups under the age of 55\u2014that is, age groups whose risk of serious COVID is miniscule. Data from the Lancet shows that 16-year-olds, for example, have a 99.99 percent chance of surviving COVID; 30-year-olds a 99.94 percent chance; and 50-year-olds a 99.57 percent chance of surviving.\n\nThe consent form for trial participants indicates Pfizer was aware of the risk of myocarditis and the possibility of an adverse impact on women\u2019s reproductive health.\n\nThese revelations throw serious doubt over efforts at the state level to mandate COVID vaccines for school children, especially considering the fact that, according to the CDC, a majority of kids in the US have had COVID.\n\nSince a majority of kids have had COVID, according to Pfizer\u2019s own data, they are equally protected as the vaccinated. Overall, younger Americans\u2019 risk of death from COVID is nearly zero, yet they experience more severe adverse effects at higher rates from the COVID vaccines. In response to this data, not only has the FDA approved the shots for everyone aged five and up, they may approve a third shot for kids. This is absurd and can only be explained by the government doing what it can to safeguard the profits of pharmaceutical companies. We proposed earlier that the end game in recommending the shots for kids is to get COVID vaccines added to the CDC\u2019s recommended childhood schedule. This perpetuates the protection from liability for the harm the vaccines cause and guarantees a continued market for the vaccines year in and year out.\n\nIt is crony medicine at its finest.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health - ANH Protects Free Speech About Natural Health Modalities, Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy, Homeopathy and Access To Natural Therapies.", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer Documents Show Natural Immunity Works - Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health", "description": "Are profits trumping health and safety when it comes to vaccinating young people against COVID?
