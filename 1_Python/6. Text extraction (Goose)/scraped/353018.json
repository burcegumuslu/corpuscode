And When | ZeroHedge", "cleaned_text": "Authored by Jeffrey A. Tucker via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nWhat if Anthony Fauci co-authored an article on vaccines that would have gotten you and I blocked and banned at any point in the last three years?\n\nHis article in Cell - \u201cRethinking next-generation vaccines for coronaviruses, influenzaviruses, and other respiratory viruses\u201d - says it as plainly as possible: the COVID vaccine did not work because it could not work.\n\nFirst some review from what we knew before this whole fiasco began.\n\nVaccines are not suitable for coronaviruses. Such respiratory viruses spread and mutate too quickly. This is why there has never been a vaccine for the common cold and why the flu shot is predictably suboptimal. Vaccines can only be sterilizing and contribute to public health when the virus is a stable pathogen like Smallpox and Measles. For coronaviruses, there is really only one way forward: better anti-virals, therapeutics, and acquired immunity.\n\nThe above paragraph has been repeated to me countless times in my life, especially after COVID hit. Every expert was on the same page. There was simply no question about it. Anything that would be called a vaccine would lack the features of vaccines past. It would not stop infection or transmission, much less end a bad season for respiratory viruses. This is why the FDA has never approved one. It would not and could not make it through trials, especially given the safety risks associated with every vaccine.\n\nMaybe, maybe, there exists the possibility that you can come up with one variant but it is not likely to be approved in time to be effective. It might provide temporary protection against severe outcomes from one variant but it will be useless against further mutations. In addition, vaccine-induced protection is not as broad as natural immunity, so it is likely that the person would get infected later. Boosting is likely only to pertain to last month\u2019s mutation, and raises dangers of itself: imprinting the immune system in ways that make it less effective.\n\nSadly, posting those three paragraphs on social media at any point in the last three years would likely get you censored or even banned. Normal science was suppressed. Common knowledge among experts was verboten. Everything we\u2019ve learned for a century or even two millennia was thrown out. The job of censorship was tasked to a gaggle of ill-educated tech workers obeying the FBI overlords, so they went along.\n\nAnd here we are two years after the vaccine rollout and the truth is rather well known. The vaccines were an enormous flop. At best. At worst, they caused tremendous amounts of injury and death as compared to any vaccine ever approved for the market. That they were forced on people in many professions\u2014and backed by a Stalinesque media frenzy\u2014is simply incredible. Several cities even locked themselves down for the vaccinated only. Even now, unvaccinated non-Americans cannot travel to the United States, unless they come across the southern border.\n\nAnd yet only now does Fauci choose to lay out the science that we knew long ago. There is nothing particularly interesting in his article. Only the timing is interesting: following trillions in pharma profits, millions displaced by mandates, and suffering from injury all over the world. Now he says that there was really no chance that the vaccine would be either effective or necessarily safe.\n\nThis is a level of trolling that is truly unthinkable and indescribable.\n\nHere is the summary of the article:\n\n\u201cViruses that replicate in the human respiratory mucosa without infecting systemically, including influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, endemic coronaviruses, RSV, and many other \u2018common cold\u2019 viruses, cause significant mortality and morbidity and are important public health concerns. Because these viruses generally do not elicit complete and durable protective immunity by themselves, they have not to date been effectively controlled by licensed or experimental vaccines. In this review, we examine challenges that have impeded development of effective mucosal respiratory vaccines, emphasizing that all of these viruses replicate extremely rapidly in the surface epithelium and are quickly transmitted to other hosts, within a narrow window of time before adaptive immune responses are fully marshaled.\u201d\n\nThere are profound safety issues to consider too. It takes a very long time to assure that.
