Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nPfizer and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) withheld evidence that COVID-19 vaccinations led to an increased risk of myocarditis, especially in young males, according to two sets of documents made public this week.\n\nConfidential Pfizer documents leaked Thursday by Project Veritas show the company had \u201cevidence that suggests patients who receive a COVID-19 vaccine are at an increased risk of myocarditis.\u201d\n\nAnd heavily redacted CDC documents obtained by Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate the agency provided an undercounted figure of post-COVID-19-vaccination myocarditis cases to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health in early 2021.\n\nThe latest revelations come as Germany, Japan and other governments are raising questions about the significant numbers of severe adverse events recorded in individuals following administration of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAccording to researchers at the National Organization for Rare Disorders, myocarditis can result from infections, or it may result directly from a toxic effect such as a toxin or a virus.\n\n\u201cMore commonly the myocarditis is a result of the body\u2019s immune reaction to the initial heart damage,\u201d researchers said.\n\nAn internal Pfizer document leaked to Project Veritas on Thursday, updated Feb. 11, 2022, and authored by eight scientists in Pfizer\u2019s Drug Safety Research & Development division, indicates that the drugmaker was aware of a connection between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and higher incidence rates of myocarditis within two weeks of vaccination \u2014 particularly following the second dose of the primary series.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that suggests patients who receive a COVID-19 vaccine are at an increased risk of myocarditis,\u201d the document read.\n\n\u201cOnset was typically within several days after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (from Pfizer or Moderna), and cases have occurred more often after the second dose than the first dose.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the United States after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), particularly in adolescents and young adults (CDC 2021).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pattern of cases conform, as per the label, to a pattern of myocarditis cases occurring in majority of young males below 29 years of age within the first two weeks post-vaccination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reasons for male predominance in myocarditis and pericarditis incidence post COVID-19 vaccination remain unknown.\u201d\n\nAlthough Pfizer couldn\u2019t identify a \u201cclear mechanism\u201d behind the increased risk in males, it did identify several possibilities.\n\nThese included direct cardiotoxicity, acute/active viral infection, genetic predisposition and pre-existing conditions, a prior history of myocarditis, immune-mediated mechanisms and vaccine-associated autoimmunity, molecular mimicry to the spike protein and sex-related effects.\n\nThese cases occurred, according to the document, despite a claimed low incidence of myocarditis during the clinical trials for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cWithin the participants 16 years of age and older from the Pfizer clinical trial dataset, two cases of pericarditis were reported through the data cut-off date of 18 June 2021,\u201d the document read. \u201cThese cases originated from the Phase 3 clinical study C4591001 and both were deemed not related to study treatment by the Investigator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were no cases of myocarditis reported as serious adverse events through the data cut-off date of 18 June 2021,\u201d the document added.\n\nBased on these incidences of myocarditis, the document states the product labels for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine were updated to state:\n\n\u201cPost marketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within 7 days following the second dose of the 2-dose primary series.\n\n\u201cThe observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age.\u201d\n\nThis change had already been made as of August 2021, according to a document released as part of the so-called \u201cPfizer documents\u201d \u2014 documents pertaining to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) issuance of Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe \u201cPfizer documents\u201d were released last year by court order following a FOIA request filed by Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency.\n\nAnother internal Pfizer document from these same \u201cPfizer documents\u201d states that on July 13, 2021, it was suggested that myocarditis and pericarditis be added \u201cto the PVP\u201d (pharmacovigilance plan).\n\nThis addition appears to have taken place.\n\nThe Pfizer pharmacovigilance plan of July 28, 2021 \u2014 also contained within the \u201cPfizer documents\u201d release \u2014 lists myocarditis and pericarditis as \u201cimportant identified risk[s]\u201d identified in Pfizer\u2019s safety database on June 18, 2021.\n\nA pharmacovigilance plan \u201cproposes activities to better characterize and assess the risks during the lifecycle of a medicine. (e.g., to investigate frequency, severity, seriousness and outcome of a risk under normal conditions of use, and/or which populations are particularly at risk).\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s July 28, 2021 pharmacovigilance plan stated that two serious adverse events of pericarditis were reported during the C4591001 clinical trial, although \u201cboth [were] deemed not related to study treatment by the Investigator.\u201d\n\nThe document also refers to data from Pfizer\u2019s safety database, stating that among people 16 and older, \u201c490 cases reported events related to myocarditis and 371 cases reported events related to pericarditis (in 38 of these 823 cases, the subjects developed both myocarditis and pericarditis related events).\u201d\n\nOf these 490 cases, 26 were later definitively rejected as not being myocarditis, leaving 464 cases ranging from \u201cdefinitive case\u201d to \u201creported event.\u201d From there, 459 were listed as \u201cserious,\u201d 337 required hospitalization, and 14 resulted in death.\n\nNearly 71% of these cases were recorded in males.\n\nOf 371 reported pericarditis cases in individuals 16 and over, all but one was listed as \u201cserious,\u201d 206 required hospitalization, and 3 resulted in death.\n\nPfizer, in the same pharmacovigilance plan, claimed that no myocarditis or pericarditis cases were recorded in C4591001 trial participants ages 12 to 15.\n\nHowever, its safety database recorded 11 possible cases of myocarditis \u2014 all but one among males, 10 of which were \u201cserious\u201d and nine of which required hospitalization.\n\nFour cases of pericarditis among males between the ages of 12 and 15 also were recorded in the safety database, three of which were considered serious and one of which required hospitalization.\n\nHowever, in the July 28, 2021 pharmacovigilance plan, Pfizer told the FDA:\n\n\u201cConsidering the low rates of myocarditis and pericarditis reported following vaccination, balanced with the risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) caused by SARS-CoV-2, the public health impact of post-vaccination myocarditis and pericarditis is minimal.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, in another leaked document publicized by Project Veritas, dated May 2022, further confirms Pfizer was aware of the increased incidence of myocarditis.\n\nAccording to the leaked document:\n\n\u201cAdverse events (AEs) following COVID-19 vaccination are of high clinical importance: even adverse events with small incidence may be seen in appreciable numbers given the massive scope of the vaccination effort.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that suggests patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine are at an increased risk of myocarditis.\u201d\n\nDocuments provided by the CDC in response to an Oct. 12, 2022 FOIA request submitted by CHD reveal the agency provided an undercounted number of recorded myocarditis cases following COVID-19 vaccination to the Israeli Ministry of Health.\n\nThe FOIA request asked the CDC to \u201cprovide all emails sent by any of the relevant individuals or received by any of the relevant individuals (whether directly or via cc or bcc) containing the search word \u2018myocarditis\u2019\u201d between Oct. 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021.\n\n\u201cThere has been considerable public discussion of and controversy about how to weigh\n\nthe risk of myocarditis that is associated with COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d the request stated. \u201cThe public has a significant interest in having a full understanding of how U.S. public health agencies have addressed this issue.\u201d\n\nFollowing a response by the CDC, CHD on Nov. 17, 2022, narrowed down its request to include only documentation containing the term \u201cmyocarditis\u201d within 25 words of \u201c(covid or report* or child* or adolescent* or young*or teen* or male or fatal* or death* or die* or serious or severe or hospital*).\u201d\n\nThe heavily redacted 985-page tranche of documents provided to CHD included a Feb. 28, 2021 request, on page 692, from Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health. The request, logged on that date by CDC\u2019s internal task tracking system, stated:\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a large number of myocarditis and pericarditis cases in young individuals soon after Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. We would like to discuss the issue with a relevant expert at CDC.\u201d\n\nA CDC email, dated March 10, 2021, and found on pages 710-714 of the document, read:\n\n\u201cThey are investigating a safety signal of myocarditis/myopericarditis in a younger population (16-30 years old) following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health stated they received reports of around 40 cases of this adverse event.\u201d\n\nIn the March 10, 2021 response, page 861, sent by the CDC to the Israeli Ministry of Health stated:\n\n\u201cA search of the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) conducted on February 23, 2021 revealed 27 cases (6 cases of myocarditis, 7 cases of myopericarditis, 14 cases pericarditis).\n\n\u201cTwelve cases occurred after dose 1, 7 cases after dose 2, and the dose was not reported for 8 cases. Four patients had comorbid conditions that could suggest alternate etiologies for the adverse event.\n\n\u201cDuring this analysis period the reporting rate of myopericarditis following administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was low and estimated to be 0.7 per million doses of vaccine administered.\n\n\u201cHowever, the limitations of passive surveillance such as under-reporting, lack of a control group, missing and incomplete data make it challenging to assess causation.\n\n\u201cThus, FDA has not made a final determination regarding the causality between myopericarditis and the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nHowever, up to Feb. 23, 2021, VAERS had actually received 36 reports of myocarditis \u2014 although at that time, the database was significantly backlogged.\n\nIt is unclear why data from a Feb. 23, 2021 search was provided by the CDC, when the request from Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health was submitted on Feb. 28, 2021. There is no indication that there was contact from the Israeli health ministry with the CDC regarding this issue prior to Feb. 28, 2021.\n\nWhile reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed, the system has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nStudies have found further deficiencies in the VAERS system, including deleted or missing reports, the delayed entry of reports and the \u201crecoding of Medical\n\nDictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms from severe to mild.\u201d\n\nOut of the deleted or missing reports, 13% pertained to deaths and 63% represented severe adverse events.\n\nVAERS data is publicly accessible on the internet and presumably would already have been available to the Israeli Health Ministry as a result, therefore it is unclear why the CDC appears to have relied on this data in its response to Israel.\n\nMoreover, by March 10, 2021, the presumed date of the CDC response to the Israeli Health Ministry, 14 more cases of myocarditis were reported to VAERS, for a total of 49 such cases identified in the database.\n\nOf the 36 myocarditis cases reported to VAERS by Feb. 23, 2021, 25 were in males, 21 involved the Moderna vaccine (15 males), and 15 involved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (10 males).\n\nAnd of the 49 cases recorded by March 10, 2021, 35 were in males, 26 involved the Moderna vaccine (20 males) and 23 involved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (15 males).\n\nThe average age of the patients was 33.6 and median age was 31.5 \u2014 with the average age of male cases being 31.1 (median 28) and the average age of females 40.8 (median 36.5), indicating a higher incidence in younger males.\n\nThe average number of days before onset and diagnosis following vaccination was 5.4, with a median of 3 days.\n\nWith hundreds of pages\u2019 worth of redactions, it is unclear if there are more documents or data that would provide further insights into the response provided by the agency to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health.\n\nIn its Feb. 24 response, the CDC claims the redacted documents are protected by statute, confidentiality laws or privacy laws.\n\nNotably, on the same day as the Israel Ministry of Health\u2019s request to the CDC, Pfizer published a document \u2014 released as part of last year\u2019s \u201cPfizer Documents\u201d release from the FDA \u2014 titled \u201cCumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse Event Reports of PF-07302048 (BNT162B2) received through 28-Feb-2021.\u201d\n\nBNT162B2 refers to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.\n\nThis document indicated that 25 cases of myocarditis were reported by Feb. 28, 2021 as part of a list of \u201cadverse events of special interest\u201d (AESI).\n\nThis figure drew from several databases, including the Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC), the EU\u2019s ACCESS protocol, U.S. CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance) and the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.\n\nSeveral recent studies have shown an increased prevalence of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cDelayed Vigilance: A Comment on Myocarditis in Association with the COVID-19 Injections,\u201d by Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D. and Brian Hooker, Ph.D., P.E., published Oct. 17, 2022 in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice, and Research, found that two months after COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out to the public, a statistically significant safety signal for myocarditis in males ages 8 to 21 appeared in VAERS.\n\nHowever, as previously reported by The Defender, even though this safety signal was visible as early as Feb. 19, 2021, CDC officials waited until May 27, 2021 before alerting the public.\n\nBy then, over 50% of the eligible U.S. population had received at least one mRNA COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 and the FDA expanded the EUA of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents 12 and older.\n\nAnother study, released April 15, 2022 by seven Israeli researchers, examined the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in adults previously were infected with COVID-19, between March 2020 and January 2021.\n\nDespite arguments that an increase in myocarditis diagnoses may be attributed to COVID-19 infections instead of the vaccines, the study \u201cdid not observe an increased incidence of either pericarditis nor myocarditis in adult patients recovering from COVID-19 infection.\u201d\n\nAs of March 3, 16,641 cases of myocarditis were recorded in VAERS following the receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine or booster \u2014 with the number growing to 16,660 when including diagnoses of bacterial myocarditis, infectious myocarditis, mycotic myocarditis, post-infection myocarditis and septic myocarditis.\n\nOf the latter number, 10,701 cases (64.2%) were recorded in males.\n\nWhile the age of over half of the patients in these recorded cases was listed as \u201cunknown,\u201d in cases where an age was recorded, myocarditis diagnoses peaked in the 18-29 year age group, with high prevalence also found in the 6-17 and 30-39 age groups.\n\nOf 2,778 cases in the 18-29 age group, 2,211 were recorded in males \u2014 further indicating the particularly high risk of myocarditis young males face following COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAs early as October 2021, Sweden\u2019s Public Health Agency paused Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for people born 1991 and later, \u201cas data pointed to an increase of myocarditis and pericarditis among youths and young adults that had been vaccinated,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nAt around the same time, Finland\u2019s public health authorities also paused the vaccine in young people.\n\nAnd in November 2022, Sweden paused the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine for those under 30, due to an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.\n\nAs reported by The Defender in June 2022, Novavax received EUA from the FDA despite \u201cMultiple events of myocarditis/pericarditis\u201d recorded during clinical trials.\n\nEarlier this week, Yanagase Hirofumi, a member of Japan\u2019s House of Councillors, accused the Japanese government of covering up injuries and deaths stemming from the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHirofumi told the House of Councillors that in Japan\u2019s vaccine-related adverse events tracking system, at least 2,001 deaths following COVID-19 vaccination have been recorded.\n\nHowever, despite \u201capproximately 260 cases in which the doctor in charge reported that there was probably a link between the vaccine and the death\u201d and, citing Japan\u2019s health minister, \u201c52 cases where a pathologist has performed an autopsy, and reported that there is a link between the vaccine and the death,\u201d the database indicates that \u201conly one case has been found to have a causal relationship between the vaccine and death.\u201d\n\nHirofumi cited the example of \u201ca man in his 30s\u201d who \u201cdied three days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. The cause of death was myocarditis,\u201d adding that \u201c as a result of the autopsy, doctors concluded that there was a link between the vaccine and the death.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, Germany\u2019s federal minister of health Karl Lauterbach \u2014 previously a proponent of a national vaccine mandate who had stated the COVID-19 vaccines had \u201cno side effects\u201d \u2014admitted that serious adverse events were prevalent and that the vaccine injured are being ignored by the authorities.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer, CDC
