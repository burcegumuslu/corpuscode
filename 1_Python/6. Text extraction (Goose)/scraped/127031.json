Today he\u2019s an outspoken proponent of turning to natural substances as a first approach to living without pain.\n\nIn this interview, Michael tells you how you can approach life and the future from the many different angles that the master used in his own work, allowing you to \u2018Think Like DaVinci\u2019 and \u2018Work Like DaVinci\u2019, both titles of his hot selling books.\n\nWho are visionaries?
