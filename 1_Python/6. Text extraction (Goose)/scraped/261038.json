In 1920, Charles Michael Higgins' \"Horrors of Vaccination Exposed and Illustrated: Petition to the President to Abolish Compulsory Vaccination in Army and Navy\" (now available in a new 2008 edition) issued a \"Public Challenge to Health Departments\" in citing \"Deaths from Vaccination Denied and Concealed - More Deaths from Vaccination than from Smallpox,\" then continued: \"In order that there shall be no misunderstanding about the serious charge which I bring against vaccination, as being now actually more dangerous to public health and human life than natural smallpox, and the equally serious charge which I make against vaccinating doctors - who now control our Departments of Health and Vital Statistics - of denying and concealing these facts from the people, I now issue this special challenge\" to the New York city and state authorities that \"I will....prove from their death certificates and vital records, now concealed and withheld from the public, that there have been more deaths from vaccination than from smallpox in every year for the past fifteen years in the City and State of New York.\" Calling compulsory vaccinations \"medical barbarism,\" Higgins petitioned President Woodrow Wilson to stop mandating them for army and navy personnel. He cited facts he called shocking, including death certificates of primary school aged children \"all killed in one week in September, 1915, from vaccination resulting in lockjaw and septicemia\" and numerous others dead from \"vaccine infection.\" Yet throughout 1915, only three people died from smallpox. \"Compulsory disease as a condition for public schooling or for service in army and navy is medically barbarous and legally unconstitutional, and should be abolished.\" They violate the \"right to life, health, and education...\" He asked Wilson to pardon court-martialed soldiers who refused non-consensual vaccinations, then imprisoned at \"hard labor for twenty-five years!....for asserting (their) right to the medical sanctity of (their) own bod(ies)....\" He said that in the 1904 - 05 Russo-Japanese War, typhoid vaccinations weren't used. Instead, for almost the first time, modern, effective sanitation and hygiene practices were employed, and few soldiers experienced typhoid fever. But in the WW I Gallipoli campaign, English soldiers got typhoid vaccinations. Unsanitary conditions prevailed, and many succumbed to typhoid and other infectious diseases. In 1918 under conditions of poor sanitation for US forces, vaccinations proved ineffective in preventing \"a high death-rate among the well vaccinated men.\" On March 28, 1919, an official report from the Chief Surgeon of the AEF in the US Public Health was titled, \"Typhoid Vaccination no Substitute for Sanitary Precautions.\" Higgins quoted medical authorities admitting vaccination dangers and condemning their mandatory use. The 1913 edition of Osler's \"Modern Medicine,\" Volume I stated: \"With the greatest care, however, certain (vaccination) risks are present and so it is unwise for the physician to force the operation upon those who are unwilling, or to give assurance of absolute harmlessness.\" In 1889, the English Commission on Vaccination exhaustively studied the issue, published its findings in 1896, concluded that vaccinations were dangerous, and said laws making them compulsory should be repealed or modified. An enacted \"conscientious clause\" subsequently let parents exempt their children. Yet, contrary to fears at the time, smallpox greatly declined because of improved sanitation and good hygiene practices. As early as the mid-19th century, books about vaccine dangers included Dr. Charles Schieferdecker's \"Dr. CGG Nittinger's evils of vaccination\" (1856), William Tebb's \"Sanitation, not Vaccination the True Protection against Small-Pox\" (1881), William White's \"The Story of a Great Delusion\" (1885), Alfred Russel Wallace's \"Vaccination Proved Useless & Dangerous\" (1889), Dr. Tenison Deane's \"The Crime of Vaccination\" (1913), and many others. In his book, Higgins referred to vaccinations as the cause of \"great epidemics of deadly disease in animals and mankind....\" and cited government reports he called \"notorious public facts.\" \"In October, November, and December, 1901, (a tetanus epidemic occurred) after vaccination(s were administered) in Camden, Philadelphia, and to a certain extent in near-by towns.\" Higgins wrote the Secretary of War citing proof \"that there was a distinct medical and logical relation between influenza and vaccination, and that many serious diseases, including smallpox and cowpox, commence like influenza....\" The \"wholesale and repeated vaccinations in the military camps throughout the world (suggested) that this vaccine infection had escaped....and was running wild as a world-wide epidemic infection,\" and to check it required all vaccinations be halted. He stressed what he called \"no mere hypothesis or theory, but rather a hard fact\" borne out by \"foot and mouth disease\" epidemics in cattle and other animals, \"some of which originated from two of the largest vaccine factories in this country,\" at the time in Philadelphia and Detroit. He cited US Bureau of Animal Industry and US Department of Agriculture reports that clearly showed vaccine infection as the cause of the 1902 and 1908 epidemics, and the \"strong suspicion\" that later ones in 1914 and 1915 were as well. He called for the abolition of \"dangerous medical domination and monopoly which now controls our Departments,\" which had long abused public power, that denied \"Medical Truth, Freedom and Progress (and) which should no longer be tolerated.\" He urged that compulsory army and navy personnel vaccinations be abolished, replaced solely by voluntary ones. He said \"the practice of inflicting on the human body a compulsory medical disease, which is dangerous to the health and life and causes many deaths every year, is obviously illegal and a medical crime on the people which must be suppressed.\" On September 17, 1919, he asked President Wilson to put a stop to \"vaccination horrors and medical mendacities.\" Vaccinations Given US Military Forces During Major Military Conflicts since 1775 From at least the 1770s to the present, inoculations were routinely used. From the American Revolution through the Spanish-American War, smallpox vaccinations were administered. In WW I, typhoid was added, and in WW II, shots were given for smallpox, typhoid, typhus, tetanus, cholera, diphtheria influenza, scarlet fever, plague, paratyphoid A and B, and yellow fever. The Korean War adopted the same regimen. Vietnam added immunizations for polio, tetanus-diphteria toxoids, measles and meningococcal. For the Gulf War, still more were added for anthrax, botulinum, adenovirus types 4 and 7, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), and rabies - a virtual toxic stew besides depleted uranium exposure that combined caused Gulf War syndrome, its devastating effects on many thousands of troops, yet the Pentagon denied it existed. The Afghan and Iraq wars added varicella (chicken pox), hepatitis A, influenza, yellow fever, pneumococcal, plus the upcoming Swine Flu vaccine. In combination, US military forces now get a greater than ever toxic brew of up to 20 dangerous inoculations plus booster shots (including for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis DTaP) that assure damage to (or destruction of) their immune systems followed by serious health problems later on. In 1919, Higgins called smallpox and typhoid inoculations \"medical barbarism.\" Today it's at an intolerable level. On April 16, 1988, a portion of a brief New York Times obituary read: On April 5, \"Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn, a physician, author and critic of the medical establishment, died after a brief illness....He was 61 years old.\" Besides teaching at the University of Illinois and Northwestern University, he was best known as \"The People's Doctor\" and for his 1979 bestseller, \"Confessions of a Medical Heretic,\" in which he cautioned against \"the harmful impact upon your life of doctors, drugs and hospitals.\" In a November 1984 East West Journal article, he called immunizations a \"medical time bomb,\" and (as a paediatrician) said the \"greatest threat to childhood diseases lies in the dangerous and ineffectual efforts made to prevent them.\" He referred to deceptive marketing practices and called paediatricians objecting to their \"bread and butter\" the equivalent of a priest denying the infallibility of the Pope. He urged parents to reject all inoculations for their children, but explained that in many states they're mandatory. He administered them early in his practice, but later stopped \"because of the myriad hazards they present.\" He summarized his concerns as follows: -- the Salk and Sabin polio vaccines don't work and cited Jonas Salk later admitting that mass inoculations caused an epidemic after 1961; -- smallpox vaccinations are \"the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared;\" -- significant inoculation risks are real; parents should avoid them when possible; -- doctors are derelict for not explaining their hazards and for \"defend(ing) them to the death;\" -- a \"myriad (of known) short-term hazards (exist but) no one knows the long-term consequences of injecting foreign (substances) into the bod(ies) of your child(ren);\" -- even more shocking is that \"no one is making any structured effort to find out,\" yet -- suspicions now confirm that mass-inoculations dramatically increase autoimmune and neurological diseases, including leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, heart disease, and numerous others ranging from annoying to lethal; -- he asked: \"Have we traded mumps and measles for cancer and leukemia,\" and blamed vaccinations for their destructive harm, including thousands of annual SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) deaths; and -- he said the best way to protect children is make sure they're not vaccinated. The Merck Manual (first published in 1899, now available in a Home Edition) warns individuals with B and/or T cell immunodeficiencies to avoid live-virus vaccines (the main ingredient in ones produced by Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, and perhaps others) due to the risk of severe or fatal infections. Immunodeficiencies include common food allergies, inhalant ones, eczema, dermatitis, neurological deterioration and heart disease. Vaccines may be lethal for people with these conditions because their immune systems can't produce a healthy reaction to the viral assault on them. Getting it may induce illnesses they're intended to prevent and many other potentially deadly ones. It's no surprise that many doctors, earlier and now, share Mendelsohn's concerns and state them. On April 2, 2002 in the London Telegraph, autism specialist Dr. Kenneth Aitken said: \"When I was in training, one in 2,500 (children were autistic). Now it is one in 250. At the moment, the only logical explanation for this is MMR\" immunizations. On April 27, 1979, at the American Society of Microbiology meeting, a paper by Drs. Anthony Morris, John Chriss, and BG Young titled, \"Occurrence of Measles in Previously Vaccinated Individuals\" concluded that \"By the (US) government's own admission, there has been a 41% failure rate in persons who were previously vaccinated against the (measles) virus.\" A 1993 British Medical Journal article stated: \"In 1993 a high court judge in the UK decided that it was impossible to know the exact contents of vaccines and that science had no idea what the cocktails of chemicals, contaminants and heavy metals contained in vaccines could do to the human body, or why they would work to prevent disease.\" Dr. J. Anthony Morris, former FDA Vaccine Control head said: \"There is a great deal of evidence to prove that immunization of children does more harm than good.\" He concluded that \"There is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza. The producers of these vaccines know that they are worthless, but they go on selling them anyway.\" Professor LC Vincent, Bioelectronics founder, said \"Vaccines DO predispose to cancer and leukemia.\" In December 1985, Dr. Albert Sabin, discoverer of the oral polio vaccine, admitted that \"Official data have shown that the large-scale vaccinations undertaken in the US have failed to obtain any significant improvement of the diseases against which they were supposed to provide protection.\" The National Institute of Health's (NIH) Dr. James A. Shannon said that \"The only wholly safe vaccine is a vaccine that is never used.\" Professor Ari Zukerman of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated: \"Immunization against smallpox is more hazardous than the disease itself.\" Dr. Paul Frame in the Journal of Family Practice believes \"There is insufficient evidence to support routine vaccination of healthy persons of any age.\" Dr. John B. Classen stated that his \"data proves that the studies used to support immunization are so flawed that it is impossible to say if immunization provides a net benefit to anyone or to society in general.\" Dr. Gerhard Buchwald concluded from the results of 150 trials that \"Vaccination is not necessary, not useful, (and) does not protect. There are twice as many casualties from vaccination as from AIDS.\" The Association of American Physicians & Surgeons stated that \"Public policy regarding vaccines is fundamentally flawed. It is permeated by conflicts of interest. It is based on poor scientific methodology (and it's) insulated from independent criticism.\" In his book, \"Health and Nutrition Secrets,\" Dr. Russell L. Blaylock wrote: \"Multiple vaccinations, especially in newborns, are another major source of childhood mercury exposure because of the mercury-containing thimerosal preservative. Over twenty-two vaccinations are now recommended for children before the age of two! Effects of exposure can vary from subtle to major malformations but even minor degrees of maldevelopment can have unacceptable consequences.\" Blaylock called flu vaccinations, especially for the elderly, \"criminal\" because of known substance dangers in them, including methylmercury, phenylmercury, ethylmercury, and aluminum that remain in the nervous system for decades and damage it. According to the WHO, \"The best vaccine against common infectious diseases (is) and adequate diet\" along with good sanitation and hygiene practices. Immunogeneticist Dr. Hugh Fudenberg concluded that individuals getting five consecutive flu shots between 1970 and 1980 (the time of his study) were 10 times more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease than others receiving two or fewer shots. He cited dangerous mercury and aluminum ingredients that accumulate in the brain causing cognitive dysfunction. Flu shots contain 25 micrograms of mercury. One microgram is considered toxic. By age two, most US children have received around 237 micrograms of mercury through vaccines alone. Vaccines contain the following toxic and others substances: -- VERO cells, a continuous line of monkey kidney cells linked to the SV-40 virus known to cause leukemia; and One or a combinations of theses substances can play havoc with the human immune and neurological systems and cause deadly autoimmune and other diseases. On August 15, a UK Mail Online article linked Swine Flu vaccines to a deadly nerve disorder called Guillan-Barre Syndrome (GBS). It cited a leaked letter from Britain's Health Protection Agency ahead of planned mass-vaccinations in the country. Sent to about 600 neurologists on July 29, it referred to America's 1976 killer virus Swine Flu scare, the urging then that everyone be vaccinated, and the millions who did with these results: -- people died from the vaccine (from respiratory failure after severe paralysis), not Swine Flu; -- experts said the vaccine increased the GBS risk level eight-fold; -- once the link was established, vaccinations were halted, but the damage was done after about 10 weeks of inoculations; and -- the US government paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle damage claims from thousands of victims. UK press coverage currently describes concern over the government releasing a vaccine \"of unknown safety,\" yet plans remain to proceed. According to Jackie Fletcher, founder of the vaccine support group Jabs: \"The (UK) Government would not be anticipating (trouble) if they didn't think there was a (GBS) connection. What we've got is a massive guinea-pig trial.\" In a July 26 rense.com article titled, \"Startling New Evidence That The 'Swine Flu' Pandemic Is Man-Made,\" Dr. A. True Ott cited evidence showing that Novartis Pharmaceuticals \"conspired with corrupt 'scientists' at the US Army Institute of Pathology, Ft. Detrick, Maryland, to create a 'novel' strain of weaponized 'influenza' virus by....'reverse engineering' the deadly 1918 killer strain (then) maliciously and surreptitiously releas(ing it globally) in March and April 2009 for the primary purpose of creating a panic-stricken world-wide demand for Novartis vaccine material.\" Ott claims the vaccine will unleash \"lethal waves of increasingly virulent and deadly disease, rather than to curtail and limit the existing outbreak\" - for huge profits and \"a massive and sudden (worldwide) depopulation\" agenda. He called the scheme much greater than Henry Kissinger's 1974 NSSM-200 diabolical plan for \"the immediate reduction of world population\" in the hundreds of millions. In 1987, Dr. Maurice Hillerman, prominent vaccine expert and head of Merck's vaccine division admitted that mass inoculations in the 1950s and 1960s likely caused thousands of annual cancer deaths because the SV40 virus (from dead monkeys) contaminated the first polio vaccine. \"According to Hillerman, MERCK KNEW THE VACCINES WERE INFECTED WITH SV40, but distributed them anyway.\" Many other examples show that \"live viruses in vaccines SPREAD....disease very effectively. When combined with SQUALENE ADJUVANT the virus becomes many times more potent and lethal.\" Ott claims Novartis' patent application reveals \"smoking gun\" evidence. The company admitted that \"their 'invented' vaccine will be effective because of ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE ORIGINS OF THE PANDEMIC FLU STRAIN THAT WAS 'REVERSE ENGINEERED'....Clearly the pandemic virus was not an act of nature. (It's) a conspiracy to commit mass murder\" for profit. Writing for Citizens for Legitimate Government (CLG), Dr. Andrew Bosworth sounded the alarm about \"The Swine Flu Hoax,\" admitted its mysterious origins, expressed concern that it might be lethal, and suggested that it was either accidently or deliberately released by corporate or government sources to cause a global epidemic for profit and power. He cited suspicions of doctors and scientists that Swine Flu was man-made because of its unique combination of viruses from different parts of the world. He mentioned spurious media and official reports of Swine Flu deaths, perhaps from conventional flu, another cause, or an unrelated medical condition. He called the US government's pandemic policy \"ridiculous\" and \"repugnant,\" leaving people terrified and uninformed enough to react adversely to their own well-being. Burgermeister is the journalist who filed criminal charges against Baxter AG, Baxter International, and Avir Green Hills Biotechnology AG \"for producing and distributing contaminated bird flu material this winter, alleging that this was a deliberate act to cause a pandemic, and also to profit\" from it. In addition, she accused Austrian Health and other Ministry officials of knowledge and support of this practice, then later named Baxter, Novartis, Sanofi Aventis, world agencies (including the WHO, UN, and CDC), and high-level officials in Austria, other European countries, and America of conspiratorial involvement. Her web site features the following recent reports: -- on August 25, the UK Daily Mail said \"Up to half of (British) family doctors do not want to be vaccinated against swine flu,\" and one-third of them said the vaccine was inadequately tested; -- in Australia, \"Leading infectious disease experts have called on the Federal Government to abandon its mass swine-flu vaccination plan because of fears the vaccine is a contamination risk that could spread blood-borne diseases;\" -- In Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1905), the US Supreme Court ruled that the state could require people to be vaccinated for the common good; in April 2009, NECN.com reported that a possible new Massachusetts law (Bill 2028) will require compulsory vaccinations; those refusing face $1,000 a day fines or 30 days in prison; after the state senate unanimously passed it, Catherine Austin Fitts concluded that Boston's money men must be \"very scared about something,\" given that the city is \"the capital of equity investment;\" -- on August 25, Health Minister Ulla Schmidt admitted on German TV that the Swine Flu vaccination campaign was a hoax and the largest ever inoculation experiment in history; and -- on August 22, Dr. Wolfgang Wogarg, chairman of the health committee in the German parliament and European Council, warned about potential Swine Flu vaccine safety. He said Novartis' vaccine contained cancerous animal cells, and emphasized peoples' fears over the disease from being inoculated. \"It is a great business for the pharmaceutical industry,\" he told Neuen Presse. Swine flu is not very different from conventional flu, but the vaccine can have dangerous side effects. Soldiers at Fort Dix, NJ were affected. About 240 became ill. One death was reported, but the illness never spread beyond the base, so it's curious why not. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention couldn't explain why the disease was contained or how it was introduced. More curious is the current hype over person-to-person transmission when it didn't happen in 1976. Northwestern University's Immunology Professor Robert Lamb explains that isolated swine flu cases in humans aren't uncommon. \"Every year, you will find some pig farmer somewhere who gets swine flu. But it usually doesn't transmit to his family,\" let alone to the surrounding area or beyond. Several years ago, Texas A & M's head of microbial and molecular pathogenesis, John Quarles, isolated a swine flu virus in a student on campus. He took samples from him and about 100 others close to him. Not a single one of them was affected, and according to Quarles: \"That's pretty classic for swine flu.\" In research conducted by Dr. Pascal James Imperato, dean at SUNY's School of Public Health, he reported that \"the 2009 H1N1 virus was less efficiently transmitted by droplet infection (inhalation of respiratory pathogens exhaled by someone infected) in ferrets compared to the seasonal human H1N1 virus. This is a significant finding as it indicates that the 2009 swine flu virus might not be as easily transmitted between humans as its seasonal counterpart\" - unless it's bioengineered to make it contagious and deadly. Swine Flu is a virus-induced respiratory illness in pigs. Few succumb and die, and humans are rarely infected, except occasionally among people having direct contact with infected animals. For most who do, symptoms are generally mild. Medications and other treatments aren't essential. The illness usually lasts from two to seven days, and most patients recover well on their own. Currently, no global pandemic or public health emergency exists, nor does forensic evidence link H1N1 to reported deaths. Yet fear-mongering persists to convince people globally to submit voluntarily to dangerous, possibly deadly bioengineered, vaccines.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
