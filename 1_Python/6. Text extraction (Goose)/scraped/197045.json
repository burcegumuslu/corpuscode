Kaplan from Stanford University.\n\nThe paper is currently undergoing peer review, and it will be a doozy to witness what happens next as its findings will technically be considered \u201cmisinformation\u201d in the State of California if Assembly Bill 2098 gets passed, which Kirsch personally believes is unlikely.\n\nAB 2098, in case you missed our earlier coverage about this bill, would criminalize doctors who advise or prescribe patients with anything other than the government-approved \u201ctreatments\u201d for disease, which in the case of the Fauci Flu means vaccines and only vaccines.\n\nIn a nutshell, the new pre-print article defies the narrative in that it exposes the injections as unsafe and ineffective. Any doctor who relies on its findings as part of his medical practice, however, could lose his medical license in the California if AB 2098 passes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how things work in California,\u201d writes Steve Kirsch on his Substack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about \u2018follow the science\u2019 anymore. That is not a defense. As a doctor you must \u2018follow the herd.\u2019 If you disagree with the masses, even if you are right, kiss your medical license good-bye!!\u201d\n\nOne of the things that makes AB 2098 unpassable, in Kirsch\u2019s opinion, is the fact that its wording makes it impossible for a physician to ever change his opinion on a matter, including vaccine safety.\n\n\u201cEither 100% of the doctors are for it, or 100% will be against it,\u201d Kirsch notes. \u201cThere can\u2019t be a middle ground of you get your license revoked so everyone has to stick with the initial narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis means the vaccines will always be safe and effective in California even when they aren\u2019t \u2026 If that doesn\u2019t enforce conformity, I don\u2019t know what will.\u201d\n\nFortunately for people not in California, such restrictions are not the law of the land \u2013 at least not yet. In Tennessee, for instance, there is an effort to stop Chinese Virus injections from going into the arms of anyone under five, period.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I was joined by @tnhousegop Leadership in requesting that @GovBillLee direct the @TNDeptofHealth to halt any distribution, promotion or recommendation of the Covid vaccine for children under 5,\u201d tweeted Rep. Jason Zachary.\n\nThe Publix supermarket chain, which is based out of Florida, is similarly refusing to inject children under five with the toxic brew \u2013 though children over five can still get jabbed at any Publix store if their parents wish.\n\n\u201cI wonder if it has been considered the idea of starting a new medical accreditation board,\u201d wrote someone at Kirsch\u2019s Substack about a possible alternative to the current status quo in places like California.\n\n\u201cLeading physicians such as Dr. Pierre Kory, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Ryan Cole, Dr. Robert Malone and many other heroic doctors could form a new AMA accrediting board licensing physicians and providing a board that does not threaten to revoke licensure based on early treatment for covid or medical freedom [from] vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the licensing accrediting board for physicians is so corrupt, it may not be redeemable, and worth starting a new according board for physicians.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the Fauci Flu shot push can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Stanford, UCLA and others admit that risk benefit to covid \u201cvaccines\u201d is NEGATIVE", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2022-06-24-stanford-ucla-admit-vaccine-risk-outweighs-benefit.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "A pre-print study authored by Peter Doshi from the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy reveals that the risk benefit to getting \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) is negative, meaning the shots are far more harmful than potentially beneficial.
