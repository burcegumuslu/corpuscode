We\u2019re about to witness the greatest health debate of the 21st century, and you\u2019re definitely going to want to have a front row seat for this.\n\nLet's face it: the only real justification for using vaccines to \"immunize\" ourselves against disease is derived from the natural fact that when challenged by infectious agents the humoral arm of our immune system launches a successful response capable of conferring lasting immunity. Were it not for the elegance, proficiency, and mostly asymptomatic success of our recombinatorial immune system in dealing so well with infectious challenges, vaccination would have no scientific...\n\nA Rotavirus was launched by India last month and a serious controversy surrounds it. This vaccine can cause a very severe disorder in the children its given to, yet the concerns are not properly addressed and the trials continue. Why is this vaccine safety data not provided upfront and at what cost?\n\nFor those paying attention, there are serious concerns to our current vaccination schedule in America. In a previous post I gave 8 of those that I felt were important enough for me to not vaccinate my daughter. In this article we look at 8 more reasons. Do any of these resonate with you?\n\nDr. Judy Mikovits Joins GreenMedInfo Advisory Board \u2013 Welcome to the Revolution! GreenMedInfo is honored to welcome Dr. Judy Mikovits to the team as she continues her search for absolute truth within the scientific community. As a true scientist, Dr. Mikovits believes it is her duty to seek truth at any cost, and we gladly stand by her side.\n\nA new investigation into \u201cpig virus\u201d contamination in human vaccines has revealed that both circovirus type 1 (PCV1) and 2 (PCV2) DNA are still present in vaccines developed against infant and childhood rotaviral gastroenteritis (RG), and which since 5 June, 2009, the World Health Organization has recommended be included in all national immunization programs. As a parent how do you feel about that?\n\nWas State Farm \"like a good neighbor\" when it dropped Rob Schneider because of his views that parents have the right to decide what's in the best interests of their children when it comes to vaccinations?\n\nScientists claim the XMRV is nothing to worry about. Perhaps you agree. Now is the time to take a look at the evidence presented by these scientists who declare there is no relationship between XMRV and disease.
