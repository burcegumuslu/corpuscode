once inside the cell, the spike protein is manufactured by the cell\u2019s ribosomes\u2026The spike protein contains a syncytin-homologous protein which is similar to the synctyin-1 in women, which is needed to form the placenta and in men, in order to create the embryo\u201d.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members being alarmed over this shocking new Japanese study, specifically because this alarming information comes two days after they examined the assertions made by American national security investigative journalist Brandon Smith in his troubling article \u201cWhy Are Globalists And Governments So Desperate For 100% Vaccination Rates?\u201d, wherein he states: \u201cThe stage is being set for a mass infertility event, and covid will be blamed in place of the experimental vaccines...This is why the establishment needs a 100% vaccination rate; unvaccinated people would stand as evidence of their crime\u201d.\n\nAs to the type of demonic sadistic monsters that would even dare perpetrate such a vile crime against humanity, this transcript sees Security Council Members agreeing it fits the psychopathic profile of the deviant sex fiends ruling over America\u2014deviant sex fiends like Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden, who yesterday tried to grope a 7-year-old boy child and whom the leftist media desperately protects by refusing to show how truly demented he is\u2014deviant sex fiends like Socialist First Lady Jill Biden, who could soon be forced to testify in the murder trial of sexual deviant serial killer Robert Durst, and whose ex-husband admits to having an affair with Durst\u2019s murdered wife before she vanished\u2014deviant sex fiends like socialist Democrat Party leader Hillary Clinton, who aside from being married to serial rapist former President Bill Clinton, last week saw one of her biggest donors Ed Buck convicted for sex murder crimes against young black men he shot up with drugs before sexually abusing\u2014sex fiends like socialist-globalist multi-billionaire George Soros, whose right-hand man Howard Rubin was accused this week of commiting bondage-sadistic crimes in his secret sex dungeon\u2014sex fiends like rabid anti-Trump hater Judge Andrew Napolitano, whom Fox News fired this week after they discovered he was sexually abusing young men\u2014sex fiends like the entire leftist Disney Company, several of whose employees where arrested this week in an undercover child sex predator sting\u2014and sex fiends like socialist Democrat Party leader Governor Andrew Cuomo, who yesterday was slammed with a 165-page report released by the Attorney General of New York beyond shockingly documenting his sexual crimes against multiple young women whom he abused and terrified.\n\nWith crowds now gasping in horror all across America as fed up parents read out loud at school board meetings the pornographic books their children are being forced to read by socialist indoctrinated teachers, this report continues, it was no surprise to see articles appearing like \u201cThe Left Has A Pedophilia Problem, And It\u2019s Out In The Open\u201d, wherein it reveals: \u201cThe left is continuing its tradition of destroying society's sexual morality, now campaigning on multiple fronts for the normalization of pedophilia\u201d\u2014and because of this socialist Democrat Party demonic sex fiend madness sweeping across America, it\u2019s also not surprising to see articles now appearing like \u201cDemocrats Panic as Latinos and Asian Voters Leave The Party\u201d, \u201cBiden Tries To Stem The Alarming Flow Of Minority Voters Away From Democrats Ahead Of Midterm Elections\u201d and \u201c3 New Polls Show They're Going To Need To Pump Out Much Bigger Doses Of \"Hopium\"\u201d.\n\nInstead of \u201cpumping out much bigger does of Hopium\u201d, though, this report notes, Biden and his demonic sexually deviant socialist forces have opted for sheer lunacy\u2014best exampled by Biden\u2019s top health director Dr. Francis Collins insanely declaring yesterday that parents must start wearing masks at home around their children, which quickly prompted sane Americans to write such things like \u201cThese are the ravings of a mad man\u2026A study from July obtained by the Wall Street Journal suggested that a child\u2019s odds of surviving a COVID-19 infection is about 99.995%\u201d\u2014then saw leftist tech giant Twitter announcing yesterday that socialist news outlets AP and Reuters will be \u201chelping us decide what\u2019s true\u201d\u2014but for anyone wanting real truth, all they have to do is look at Germany\u2019s largest newspaper Bild, whose editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt yesterday apologized for fear-driven Covid coverage, and stated:\n\nTo the millions of children in this country for whom our society is responsible, I want to express here what neither our government nor our Chancellor dares to tell you.\n\nWe ask you to forgive us.\n\nWe persuaded our children that they were going to murder their grandma if they dared to be what they are, children. Or if they met their friends.\n\nNone of this has been scientifically proven\n\nWhen a state steals the rights of a child, it must prove that by doing so it protects him against concrete and imminent danger.\n\nThis proof has never been provided.\n\nIt has been replaced by propaganda presenting the child as a vector of the pandemic.\n\nThis report concludes with this transcript showing Security Council Members expressing disgust that the \u201cCitizen Cattle\u201d these Americans have been turned into by their sex fiend socialist leaders are now beyond shockingly signing petitions advocating for their jailing of anyone not submitting to experimental Covid-19 vaccines\u2014are \u201cCitizen Cattle\u201d who\u2019ve failed to listen to what may very well be the socialist Democrat Party\u2019s funeral oration just delivered by leftist HBO host Bill Maher\u2014today does sees these \u201cCitizen Cattle\u201d having a new communist theme song to inspire them as they send their fellow citizens into the gulag\u2014and when noticing that the leftist Washington Post is today scaremongering about a new \u201cDelta-Plus\u201d variant of Covid-19, it caused Chairwoman Matviyenko Valentina to openly wonder in this transcript how soon Biden and his sexually deviant socialist forces will give Covid-19 its truest name, the \u201cCommunist Variant\u201d.
