Kimmich said that he had \u201ca few concerns\u201d because of a lack of long-term studies for the vaccine. He also said, \u201c[It is] very possible that I will be vaccinated in the future.\u201d Kimmich is not against the vaccine, science or even the government\u2019s measures in general. At the beginning of the pandemic, Kimmich and teammate Leon Goretzka started an initiative called \u201cWe Kick Corona,\u201d raising millions of dollars for charitable causes.\n\nNevertheless, columnists and government officials are taking advantage of every opportunity to wage a public war against the unvaccinated.\n\nThe media has used passive means to urge the unvaccinated to get the jab. Faz.net, for example, asked on October 25, \u201cAre Unvaccinated People Pushing Hospitals to the Breaking Point?\u201d \u201cThe incidence is rising, and there are more and more coronavirus patients in intensive care units,\u201d the article noted. \u201cExperts fear that patients without vaccination protection will overwhelm the health-care system in the winter. How bad will the pandemic of the unvaccinated be?\u201d But for many, such passive pressure is not enough.\n\nIn \u201cGovernment Still Hopes for Kimmich\u2019s Coronavirus Vaccination,\u201d Der Spiegel wrote: \u201cNow even the German government has commented on the issue. All questions about the vaccinations are of course justified, said government spokesman Steffen Seibert. However, there are \u2018clear and convincing answers\u2019 from national and international experts on aspects such as the type and effect of the vaccines or possible consequences of vaccination. He therefore hopes \u2018that Joshua Kimmich will let all this information sink in again and then perhaps also decide in favor of vaccination,\u2019 Seibert said. \u2018Because as someone who millions look to, he would then all the more have a role model effect.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet Kimmich is not alone in his concerns about vaccines. Bild.de wrote: \u201cWith this, Kimmich said what millions of Germans think and feel. Because more than 30 percent of the population is still not vaccinated. The reasons: In a study by the University of Hamburg, 74 percent of the unvaccinated said they were not completely convinced of the vaccine\u2019s safety. Sixty-seven percent said they felt under pressure.\u201d Despite this, the official government stance is that vaccinations are the only way out of the pandemic. Unvaccinated people are now required to pay for a covid test if they want to go to a restaurant or movie theater. In many places, unvaccinated citizens are completely locked out of libraries, cultural venues and restaurants, even if they have tested negative.\n\nIt appears that refusing the vaccination is akin to being an enemy of the state. One of the few supporters Kimmich had was Germany\u2019s far-right party, the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland. Kimmich became \u201ca symbolic figure by vaccination opponents or politicians and agitators, even though he probably does not carry their ideas,\u201d Spiegel noted.\n\nAs Trumpet executive editor Stephen Flurry explained in his feature \u201cGotten Your Jab Yet?\u201d the side effects of the vaccine are concerning. But the alliance between the so-called experts, the media and the government to push the same narrative and to persecute dissenting voices is perhaps even more concerning.\n\nIn \u201cThe Tyranny of \u2018Science\u2019 Falsely So Called,\u201d Mr. Flurry noted: \u201cThere is no evidence that covid-19 is substantially more contagious or deadly than a normal flu, which infects some 9 to 45 million Americans each year. There is no evidence that wearing a paper or cloth mask stops the spread of a 20-nanometer coronavirus particle. But scientists, flanked by leftist politicians and progressive media, pushed these drastic, catastrophic interventions with stunning self-assurance, quashing any dissenting concerns about the broader consequences.\u201d\n\nWe have entered a new stage of propaganda warfare that pushes a narrative that you seemingly can\u2019t escape. Truth has become irrelevant. Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry wrote in \u201cA Dangerous New Age of \u2018Worshiping the Will\u2019\u201d: \u201cWhen human beings reject God\u2019s truth, they start worshiping their own opinions. They start thinking like Satan. When this type of thinking becomes entrenched enough, people stop even caring about the difference between true and false. They start trying to magically \u2018create reality where no reality is.\u2019\u201d\n\nI encourage you to read \u201cA Dangerous New Age of \u2018Worshiping the Will\u2019\u201d to learn where our world is headed.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/24735-germany-pressures-the-unvaccinated/print", "site_name": "theTrumpet.com", "title": "World News, Economics and Analysis Based on Bible Prophecy", "image": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/trumpet-icon.png", "description": "theTrumpet.com delivers in-depth news analysis on top stories, world news, weather, economics and society in the light of Bible prophecy.", "type": "website"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/corona-winter-ueberfordern-ungeimpfte-bald-das-gesundheitssystem-17600420.html?premium", "https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/joshua-kimmich-regierung-hofft-noch-auf-corona-impfung-a-55b7ce04-c380-466f-bb7e-520ddcb7a53a", "https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/joshua-kimmich-regierung-hofft-noch-auf-corona-impfung-a-55b7ce04-c380-466f-bb7e-520ddcb7a53a", "/23961-gotten-your-jab-yet", "/24393-the-tyranny-of-science-falsely-so-called", "/22176-a-dangerous-new-age-of-worshiping-the-will", "/22176-a-dangerous-new-age-of-worshiping-the-will"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
