The CDC also plans to address \u201cDisease, Disability, and Injury Prevention and Control,\u201d as well as develop \u201cCollaborative Surveys to Provide Inputs into Vaccine-Related Economic Evaluations.\u201d\n\nThe virtual meeting is scheduled to take place on March 7 from 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST. (Related: The CDC used the same public relations firm as Pfizer and Moderna to push centralized \u201chealth communication\u201d during covid.)\n\nThe CDC is an enemy of We the People and our free speech rights\n\nThis upcoming meeting is hardly a surprise considering what has been uncovered in recent weeks from the Twitter Files. We already knew about the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) doing Big Pharma\u2019s dirty work on social media, and now we can see the CDC is in on it, too.\n\nFor years, in fact, federal agencies such as these have been working behind closed doors to stamp out the First Amendment online because free speech is ruining the globalists\u2019 plans for a world takeover.\n\nNot only have they been working against free speech about pharmaceuticals and vaccines, but these same federal agencies also want to stop people from talking about election fraud and Joe Biden\u2019s stealing of the White House from Donald Trump.\n\nOther topics that are off limits include:\n\u2022 Addressing Biden\u2019s botched withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan\n\u2022 Questioning the true origin of the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19)\n\u2022 Expressing skepticism about the safety and effectiveness of childhood vaccines\n\nThe fact that the CDC hid this upcoming secret meeting from the public just goes to show that this agency is an enemy of the American public \u2013 and an enemy of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe unearthed, secret meeting is the latest example of how federal agencies are colluding to combat alleged \u2018misinformation,\u2019 despite failing to clearly define what actually qualifies as fact vs. fiction,\u201d reported War Room.\n\n\u201cThe CDC already is the marketing arm of Big Pharma,\u201d wrote a commenter about the agency\u2019s deep-seated corruption.\n\n\u201cThe drug companies run both the CDC and the FDA,\u201d wrote another about how the Food and Drug Administration is no better.\n\n\u201cNext time you watch television, count the pharmaceutical adverts,\u201d wrote another. \u201cDrug pushin\u2019 is acceptable with a flashy commercial and a catchy tune.\u201d\n\nSomeone else commented that the true job of the U.S. government is to stop corruption and protect the American people \u2013 but instead they are part of the racket.\n\n\u201cAll branches and players of all federal, state, county and city governments in the U.S. and most countries of the their \u2018free world\u2019 are corporations,\u201d noted another about how everything has been privatized, even if it seems to be a public agency on the surface.\n\n\u201cThe United States Corporation, wholly owned by the banksters and bleedership, hijacked America in 1871 during our last lawful Congress of Lincoln\u2019s administration. It\u2019s institutionalized fraud on a grand scale. This is fascism.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the CDC can be found at CDC.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "CDC holds secret meeting about new \u201cpublic health tool\u201d to fight \u201cvaccine misinformation\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2023-01-19-cdc-secret-public-health-tool-vaccine-misinformation.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "On March 7, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is scheduled to meet \u2013 confidentially \u2013 about \u201cdeveloping a public health tool to predict the virality of vaccine misinformation.\u201d A \u201cNotice of Closed Meeting\u201d announced in the United States government\u2019s Federal Register in November 2022 explains that the CDC gathering \u201cwill be [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/652/2023/01/CDC-Vaccine-Coronavirus-Syringe.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "big government", "Big Pharma", "FDA", "deception", "corruption", "CDC", "Rule by Secrecy", "collusion", "science deception", "public health tool", "disinfo", "propaganda", "vaccine wars", "hypocrisy", "censorship", "thought police", "vaccine misinformation", "fascism", "vaccines", "tyranny", "health freedom", "pharmaceutical fraud"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://warroom.org/2023/01/16/cdc-to-hold-secret-meeting-to-censor-misinformation/", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-10-24-cdc-pr-pfizer-moderna-health-communication-scamdemic.html", "http://cdc.news", "https://warroom.org/2023/01/16/cdc-to-hold-secret-meeting-to-censor-misinformation/", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-10-24-cdc-pr-pfizer-moderna-health-communication-scamdemic.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fmedicalcensorshipcom%2F2023-01-19-cdc-secret-public-health-tool-vaccine-misinformation.html&linkname=CDC%20holds%20secret%20meeting%20about%20new%20%E2%80%9Cpublic%20health%20tool%E2%80%9D%20to%20fight%20%E2%80%9Cvaccine%20misinformation%E2%80%9D", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
