I first learned of his death in October when I was back in Chicago as a keynote speaker for Health Freedom Expo.\n\nKoinis was found dead last September from what authorities say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Though he had no kids and wasn\u2019t married, authorities state Dr. Koinis drove to a forest preserve that was some ways from his home and took his life. He was not discovered for weeks, prompting his patients to ask publicly (on our page no less) why he wasn\u2019t found sooner during a popular time of year. We did a live video tonight to many thousands on our Facebook page and had dozens of his former patients (or parents of his patients) leaving comments as to what an amazing man and doctor he was.\n\u2022 None VIDEOS: CBS Criminal Minds and 48 HOURS Just Covered my Holistic Doctor Deaths Series\n\nSome had seen his father who was also a pediatrician, and then a generation later, their children saw Dr. Koinis. We\u2019ve never seen so many heart broken patients in one live broadcast with only positive things to say about this extraordinary man.\n\nIn a sudden turn of events, investigators recently announced they found a suicide note raising questions about his vaccination records. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart indicated the note expressed regret about doctoring records, and was \u201cabout vaccines and ONLY vaccines\u201d. Dart said:\n\n\u201cThe note was very short. It was a note where he expressed a lot regret and the note was solely driven at the fact that he did things he regretted as far as the vaccinations. He was incredibly regretful for what he did and it was the only thing he mentioned in the suicide note. It was this and only this.\u201d1\n\u2022 None Recap: Full list of 80 dead scientists, with photos and shocking details\n\nDart said that the note, which was cryptic at times, talked about a window spanning around 10 years in which he either doctored records or gave fake vaccinations. Koinis was a big believer in homeopathic remedies said mainstream. The note didn\u2019t express regret in those beliefs but \u201cregrets in what he did.\u201d1\n\nDart noted, that based on a preliminary investigation, Koinis did not have financial problems or problems with his practice. However, the suicide note detailing his vaccination practices gives him pause.\n\nPatients argue this and state publicly that if a patient wanted vaccines he\u2019d give them and if they didn\u2019t he respected that. Some patients on our broadcast stated they did some vaccines but not all.\n\nWhether he fudged the paperwork for patients vaccines remains unclear, as one reporter said thus far they\u2019d found no evidence of this. Another in authority said there may be evidence he did. But again, one fact remains clear \u2013 his patients loved him.\n\nInvestigators found the probability that in some cases Dr. Koinis did not provide vaccinations to children at their parents request. Dart added:\n\u2022 None See Erin Elizabeth on the holistic doctor deaths\n\nDart questioned if this was just a case where individuals, who were against vaccinations, came to Koinis and he waived vaccinations and falsified their records, or is this larger than that?\n\nTatiana Rudolph\u2019s two children were patients of Dr. Koinis, and she said both of them received their shots. She said he was a good doctor, adding:\n\nDr Mercola and I are both from Chicago (he born in the city and me the North side) Our hearts go out to the many patients left behind along with his family and the many people who loved him.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CBS: Holistic Doctor Leaves Suicide Note He Took His Life Because: Vaccines", "description": "Investigators recently announced they found a suicide note from Dr. Van Koinis raising questions about his vaccination records.", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/cbs-holistic-doctor-leaves-suicide-note-he-took-his-life-because-vaccines/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:tag": "vaccines", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2020-02-13T05:15:22-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-11T08:29:47-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-08-11T08:29:47-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot_2020-02-12-Dr-Van-Koinis-Google-Search.png", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot_2020-02-12-Dr-Van-Koinis-Google-Search.png", "image:width": "531", "image:height": "291"}, "tags": ["News", "Vaccines", "Health", "Holistic Doctor Deaths", "Food", "Kids/Children"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Suicide Note Leaves A Medical Mystery For Patients\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7c82f_TTi0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7c82f_TTi0?feature=oembed"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Information in doctor's suicide note leads Cook County officials to urge parents to check vaccinatio\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LYp75YnBl8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LYp75YnBl8?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/videos-cbs-criminal-minds-48-hours-covered-holistic-doctor-deaths-series-last-week/", "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/02/11/doctors-suicide-note-leaves-more-questions-about-his-vaccination-practices/", "https://healthnutnews.com/recap-full-list-of-80-dead-scientists-with-photos-and-shocking-details/", "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/02/11/doctors-suicide-note-leaves-more-questions-about-his-vaccination-practices/", "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/02/11/doctors-suicide-note-leaves-more-questions-about-his-vaccination-practices/", "https://healthnutnews.com/recap", "https://healthnutnews.com/b-c-judge-orders-vaccinations-for-2-boys-over-their-mothers-objections/", "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/02/11/doctors-suicide-note-leaves-more-questions-about-his-vaccination-practices/", "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/02/11/doctors-suicide-note-leaves-more-questions-about-his-vaccination-practices/", "tg://msg?text=CBS%3A%20%20Holistic%20Doctor%20Leaves%20Suicide%20Note%20He%20Took%20His%20Life%20Because%3A%20Vaccines - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fcbs-holistic-doctor-leaves-suicide-note-he-took-his-life-because-vaccines%2F", "mailto:?subject=CBS%3A%20%20Holistic%20Doctor%20Leaves%20Suicide%20Note%20He%20Took%20His%20Life%20Because%3A%20Vaccines&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fcbs-holistic-doctor-leaves-suicide-note-he-took-his-life-because-vaccines%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-02-13T05:15:22-05:00"}
