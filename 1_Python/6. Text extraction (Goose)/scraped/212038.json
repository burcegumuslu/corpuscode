And the producer of its reformulated mRNA ingredient is National Resilience, a company with direct ties to the United States deep state and intelligence machine.\n\nFollowing just one incomplete trial involving about 800 participants that was never peer reviewed or published in a medical journal, the U.K. government decided that Moderna\u2019s new \u201cBivalent Spikevax\u201d injection is perfectly safe and effective as a \u201cvaccine candidate\u201d for the so-called Omicron, or Moronic in anagram, variant (BA.1) of the Fauci Flu.\n\nEven though Moderna is known to have fudged past studies and likely engaged in illegal activity, the U.K.\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) jumped at the opportunity to approve a new covid injection for fast profits and more injuries and deaths. (Related: Earlier this year, thousands of Moderna jabs were recalled following the discovery of a \u201cforeign body\u201d inside the vials.)\n\nUS military funding transhumanist \u201cmedicines\u201d of the future\n\nWhat we know so far about National Resilience is that it was founded in November 2020 for the purpose of \u201creinvent[ing] biomanufacturing\u201d and \u201cdemocratis[ing] access to medicines\u201d \u2013 mainly experimental gene therapies like the original Chinese Virus shots.\n\nCalling its technologies the \u201cmedicines of tomorrow,\u201d National Resilience is committed to \u201cactively invest in developing powerful new technologies to manufacture complex medicines that are defining the future of therapeutics, including cell and gene therapies, viral vectors, vaccines, and proteins,\u201d according to the company.\n\nNational Resilience just happened to appear out of nowhere, the same year as the plandemic, with a mission of building \u201ca better system for manufacturing complex medicines to fight deadly diseases,\u201d including those that could become the next plandemic.\n\nIn April 2021, National Resilience acquired Ology Bioservices Inc., a company that was awarded a $37 million contract from the U.S. military right at the same time when National Resilience was founded.\n\nThat money, we are told, was used to develop an advanced anti-covid monoclonal antibody drug. Through the sale, National Resilience also gained access to its first Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory to manufacture its cell and gene therapies, as well as live viral vaccines and vectors and oncolytic viruses.\n\nLast year, National Resilience also forged a partnership with the Canadian government, which plans to invest nearly $155 million into the company\u2019s Ontario-based subsidiary, Resilience Biotechnologies Inc.\n\nAt the time when this agreement was made, Canadian Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne admitted that the goal was to \u201cbuild future pandemic preparedness\u201d and \u201cgrow Canada\u2019s life science ecosystem as an engine for our economic recovery.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the powers that be are already working on unleashing the next plandemic and National Resilience, the Canadian government, the U.S. military, and perhaps other establishment candidates are all clamoring for their piece of the pie.\n\nNational Resilience CEO Rahul Singhvi used to be the CEO of Novavax, an operating partner at Flagship Pioneering, which played a critical role in Moderna\u2019s rise to power as a key plandemic player.\n\nOne of National Resilience\u2019s board members is former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner and Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb, who says he wants National Resilience to become the Amazon Web Services of the biotechnology industry.\n\nIt cannot be emphasized enough that National Resilience\u2019s mission is to create \u201cfuturistic\u201d medicines. It is tied to the DARPA-equivalent of the Wellcome Trust, which is also focused on futuristic, transhumanist \u201cmedicines.\u201d\n\nWhat this suggests is that the latest iterations of Fauci Flu shots are, in fact, part of the transhumanist agenda to erase natural human DNA and replace it with \u2026 well, the world is about to find out.\n\nTo keep up with the latest news about Fauci Flu shots, be sure to check out Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "NaturalNews.com", "title": "Reformulated \"Bivalent Spikevax\" covid injection from Moderna is made by company with ties to US intelligence agencies", "url": "https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-23-reformulated-bivalent-spikevax-covid-moderna-us-intelligence.html", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2022-08-23T08:02:09+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-23T11:10:36+00:00", "updated_time": "2022-08-23T11:10:36+00:00", "article:section": "Vaccines", "description": "A new Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \"vaccine\" from Moderna was just approved in the United Kingdom.
