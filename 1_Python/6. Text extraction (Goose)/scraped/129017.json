The U.S. government has been clandestinely doing it for more than 60 years, so it must have perfected the craft by now.\n\nRecent hurricanes like Noru and Ian have brought out the possibility of weather manipulation because of their erratic, unusual behavior. (Related: Hurricane Ian DEVASTATES Florida; full recovery expected to take years.)\n\nOf course, the Joe Biden administration denied this, with the president saying Ian \u201cends discussion\u201d about man-made climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on, and I think the one thing this has finally ended is a discussion about whether or not there\u2019s climate change, and [that] we should do something about it,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut experts and those who actually suffered the wrath of these storms have something else to say.\n\nClassified as Category 5 hurricane, Noru gained strength in just six hours before hitting Polillo Island in the Philippines. Residents of the island are accustomed to severe weather, but even they were stunned by how quickly Noru intensified. Hurricanes typically form within one to two days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to typhoons because we\u2019re located where storms usually land,\u201d said entrepreneur Armiel Azas Azul, who owns a bistro on the island. \u201cBut everything is very unpredictable, and Noru came very fast.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. witnessed a similar phenomenon when Ian hit Florida. Before the hurricane hit the southwestern coast of the Sunshine State, it went through two separate bursts of so-called \u201crapid intensification.\u201d\n\nThis process, which involves a cyclone\u2019s top wind speed rising by 35 miles per hour (mph) in just one day, turned Ian into a Category 4 hurricane in just 36 hours. By the time it made landfall, it carried winds of 155 mph \u2013 almost a Category 5 classification.\n\nHealth Ranger Mike Adams also noted that the movement of Ian is \u201cnot natural looking\u201d as it entered the southwestern part of Florida, stopped, turned east and headed north.\n\nGeoengineering expert Dane Wigington supported Adams\u2019 observation and they surmised that Hurricane Ian may have been \u201cweaponized\u201d to suit the federal government\u2019s needs.\n\nWigington, the executive producer of the climate engineering documentary film \u201cThe Dimming,\u201d noted that \u201cstorms can be easily manipulated these days.\u201d According to Wigington, frequency transmissions can be used to repel the storm in different directions \u2013 and that is how it is steered or maneuvered.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Hurricane Ian, it was just a drifting mass of unorganized convection and that makes the storm much easier for them to steer until it gets closer to the land-based transmitters. So, until it got south of Cuba, it basically was completely unorganized,\u201d said Wigington.\n\n\u201cAnd then with ionosphere heaters, they can affect the convection that allows the storm to start forming and strengthening, which it did right before it hit Cuba as it migrated northward by the southern end of Florida.\u201d\n\nDiscussions about weather manipulation cropped up again after educator Peggy Hall stumbled upon old U.S. documents revealing that \u201cthe government has admitted to manipulating hurricanes and forest fires for its own benefit.\u201d\n\nThe major players then were the Navy, the Air Force and General Electric, where Hall unearthed the damning details in a paper entitled \u201cHistory of Project Cirrus from 1947 to 1952,\u201d which is a study of how cloud particles and cloud modifications can affect hurricanes.\n\nAccording to Hall, the intention of \u201churricane and forest fire manipulation is to instill fear, uncertainty and inflict hardship on certain population centers, with the purpose of gaining control over people by using the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and federal funding.\u201d\n\nThe American people deserve a clearer, more detailed explanation as Ian was one of the most destructive hurricanes ever to batter Florida with catastrophic winds gusting up to 251 km/h, claiming over a hundred lives and billions of dollars in damage to crops and properties.\n\nFinancial experts believe it would take years before the state fully recovers from the destruction and devastation brought about by Ian. In fact, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is asking $33 billion in recovery aid from the national government to rouse the state economy back to life.\n\nOf course, the old practice of seeding clouds with silver and lead iodide to induce rain is likely to have an effect on hurricanes, too.\n\nThe U.S. military conducted geoengineering weather modification during the Vietnam War that started in 1955 as a \u201cstrategy to muddy the supply roads on the Ho Chi Minh trail by causing it to rain with cloud seeding.\u201d\n\nThe proponents then were the late Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIf the Biden administration is really into manipulating hurricanes and wildfires, the agenda must be to highlight the worsening effects of \u201cclimate change\u201d and offer solutions that would work in its favor like imposing carbon emission taxes and possible climate lockdowns.\n\nThe government does not only want to impose its will on the people, it wants to play God by tinkering with Mother Nature.\n\nWatch the video below about controlling Hurricane Ian.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nHurricane Ian leaves over TWO MILLION Floridians without power.", "opengraph": {"title": "Federal government may have \u201cweaponized\u201d Hurricane Ian to magnify climate change narrative", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2022-10-19-federal-government-weaponized-hurricane-ian-climate-change.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "Manipulating weather conditions, including hurricanes, is nothing new.
