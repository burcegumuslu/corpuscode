Paul says \u2018Fauci lied again\u2019; lying to Congress could result in jail time\n\nRepublican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul believes that new documents about research at the Wuhan lab in China prove his accusations that Dr. Anthony Fauci lied to Congress.\n\nFauci has continuously denied that the National Institutes of Health paid for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab.\n\n\u201cSurprise surprise \u2013 Fauci lied again And I was right about his agency funding novel Coronavirus research at Wuhan. Read this thread and the papers released,\u201d he said attached to a thread from Rutgers professor of chemistry and chemical biology, Richard H. Ebright explaining a story at The Intercept.\n\nNEWLY RELEASED DOCUMENTS provide details of U.S.-funded research on several types of coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. The Intercept has obtained more than 900 pages of documents detailing the work of EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based health organization that used federal money to fund bat coronavirus research at the Chinese laboratory. The trove of documents includes two previously unpublished grant proposals that were funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as well as project updates relating to EcoHealth Alliance\u2019s research, which has been scrutinized amid increased interest in the origins of the pandemic.\n\nThe documents were released in connection with ongoing Freedom of Information Act litigation by The Intercept against the National Institutes of Health. The Intercept is making the full documents available to the public.\n\n\u201cThis is a road map to the high-risk research that could have led to the current pandemic,\u201d Gary Ruskin, who serves as the executive director of the U.S. Right To Know group that has been investigating to origins of the pandemic, said.\n\nBut where it gets interesting is where the story showed that the United States Government gave $3.1 million to EcoHealth Alliance, an American company, to support bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan lab.\n\nAround $600,000 of that was used by WIV to find and alter bat coronaviruses that could infect humans.\n\nIt also showed research was done on genetically altered mice with human cell receptors was conducted at the Wuhan University Center for Animal Experiment, not at the WIV as was previously believed.\n\n\u201cThe documents make it clear that assertions by the NIH Director, Francis Collins, and the NIAID Director, Anthony Fauci, that the NIH did not support gain-of-function research or potential pandemic pathogen enhancement at WIV are untruthful,\u201d professor Ebright said.\n\nIf it is true that Fauci lied to Congress he could be in a serious jam, as 18 US Code 1621 explains the penalty for perjury.\n\nThat code explains that if a person \u201cis guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd 18 US Code 1001 explains that anyone who \u201cmakes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\u201d could \u201cbe fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years.\u201d\n\nPaul and Fauci, both doctors, have had a contentious and combative relationship, as was shown during Dr. Fauci\u2019s most recent hearing before Congress where Paul accused him of lying.\n\nIt happened in July when Fauci was before the Senate and Paul accused him of \u201clying\u201d about gain of function research at the Wuhan, China lab being financed by the United States, Fox News reported.\n\nFauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky are also likely to face questions on whether the U.S. should bring back health measures like mask mandates as the delta COVID variant spreads around the country.\n\nIn his questioning of Fauci, Paul stepped close to the line of accusing Fauci of lying to Congress in previous testimony in which he said that the NIAID had never funded gain-of-function research in China. Citing a paper on research about bat coronaviruses, Paul said that U.S. money had essentially gone to the hazardous and controversial research \u2013 an assertion Fauci strongly objected to.\n\nPaul asked Fauci if he wanted to retract his previous statement before Congress that the \u201cNIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan,\u201d citing that lying to Congress is a crime\n\n\u201cI have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement,\u201d Fauci said, noting that the research Paul talked about was \u201cjudged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain of function.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you take an animal virus, and you increase its transmissibility to humans\u2014you\u2019re saying that\u2019s not gain-of-function research?\u201d Paul saidTop of Form\n\n\u201cSenator Paul, you do not know what you are talking about, and I want to say that officially,\u201d Fauci said.\n\n\u201cIt says that \u2018scientific research that increases the transmissibility among animals is gain-of-function,\u2019\u201d he said. The Wuhan researchers \u201ctook animal viruses\u2026then increased their transmissibility to humans. How you can say that is not gain-of-function\u2014it\u2019s a dance, and you\u2019re dancing around this, because you\u2019re trying to obscure responsibility for four million people around the world dying from a pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you say that\u2019s not gain-of-function? It\u2019s a dance and you\u2019re dancing around this because you\u2019re trying to obscure responsibility for 4 million people dying around the world from a pandemic,\u201d the senator hit back, cutting Fauci off.\n\nFauci was livid with the senator.\n\n\u201cIf the point that you are making is that the grant that was funded as a subaward \u2026 created SARS-COV-2, that\u2019s where you are getting,\u201d he said as Paul cut him off again.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know \u2026 but all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab and there will be responsible for those that funded the lab, including yourself,\u201d the senator said, noting that while \u201cnobody is saying\u201d what was created in the Wuhan lab caused the pandemic the lab was still doing gain of function research that was, in part, paid for by the NIH.\n\n\u201cI totally resent the lie you are now propagating, senator,\u201d the epidemiologist said, noting that it is molecularly impossible the research that the NIH funded was responsible for the creation of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\u201cYou are implying that what we did was responsible for the deaths of individual[s], I totally resent that and if anybody is lying here, senator, it is you,\u201d he said.", "opengraph": {"title": "Sen.

Citing a paper on research about bat coronaviruses, Paul said that U.S. money had essentially gone to the hazardous and controversial research \u2013 an assertion Fauci strongly objected to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Paul asked Fauci if he wanted to retract his previous statement before Congress that the \u201cNIH never funded gain of function research in Wuhan,\u201d citing that lying to Congress is a crime</p>\n<p>\u201cI have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement,\u201d Fauci said, noting that the research Paul talked about was \u201cjudged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain of function.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you take an animal virus, and you increase its transmissibility to humans\u2014you\u2019re saying that\u2019s not gain-of-function research?\u201d Paul saidTop of Form</p>\n<p>\u201cSenator Paul, you do not know what you are talking about, and I want to say that officially,\u201d Fauci said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt says that \u2018scientific research that increases the transmissibility among animals is gain-of-function,\u2019\u201d he said.
