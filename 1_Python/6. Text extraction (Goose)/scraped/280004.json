Since the 1990s use of the herbicide boomed, as the farming industry adopted \u201cRoundup Ready\u201d genetically modified crop seeds that are resistant to the herbicide. \u201cFarmers spray their corn and soy fields to eliminate weeds and boost production, but this has led to glyphosate leaching into the surrounding environment. In Quebec, for example, traces of glyphosate have been found in Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie rivers,\u201d says Andrew Gonzalez, a McGill biology professor and Liber Ero Chair in Conservation Biology.\n\nTo test how freshwater ecosystems respond to environmental contamination by glyphosate, researchers used experimental ponds to expose phytoplankton communities (algae) to the herbicide. \u201cThese tiny species at the bottom of the food chain play an important role in the balance of a lake\u2019s ecosystem and are a key source of food for microscopic animals. Our experiments allow us to observe, in real time, how algae can acquire resistance to glyphosate in freshwater ecosystems,\u201d says post-doctoral researcher Vincent Fug\u00e8re.\n\nEcosystems adapt but at the cost of biodiversity\n\nThe researchers found that freshwater ecosystems that experience moderate contamination from the herbicide became more resistant when later exposed to a very high level of it \u2013 working as a form of \u201cevolutionary vaccination.\u201d According to the researchers, the results are consistent with what scientists call \u201cevolutionary rescue,\u201d which until recently had only been tested in the laboratory. Previous experiments by the Gonzalez group had shown that evolutionary rescue can prevent the extinction of an entire population when exposed to severe environmental contamination by a pesticide thanks to the rapid evolution.\n\nHowever, the researchers note that the resistance to the herbicide came at a cost of plankton diversity. \u201cWe observed significant loss of biodiversity in communities contaminated with glyphosate. This could have a profound impact on the proper functioning of ecosystems and lower the chance that they can adapt to new pollutants or stressors. This is particularly concerning as many ecosystems are grappling with the increasing threat of pollution and climate change,\u201d says Gonzalez.\n\nThe researchers point out that it is still unclear how rapid evolution contributes to herbicide resistance in these aquatic ecosystems. Scientist already know that some plants have acquired genetic resistance to glyphosate in crop fields that are sprayed heavily with the herbicide. Finding out more will require genetic analyses that are currently under way by the team.\n\n\u201cCommunity rescue in experimental phytoplankton communities facing severe herbicide pollution\u201d by Fug\u00e8re V., H\u00e9bert M.-P, Costa N.B., Xu C.C.Y., Barrett R.D.H., Beisner B.E., Bell G., Fussmann G.F., Shapiro B.J., Yargeau V., and Gonzalez A. is published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.
