IgM antibodies are usually the first antibodies to arrive on the scene. Then, they switch to become IgG antibodies, which are longer-lasting and more specific to the virus.\n\nResearchers reviewed COVID-19 studies published through the end of April 2020 that reported on antibody tests, for a June 2020 study in \u200bCochrane Systematic Review\u200b. What they found was that the tests were better at detecting antibodies two or more weeks after symptoms first appeared. In the first week after the onset of symptoms, tests only detected 30 percent of people who had COVID-19. The accuracy increased to 70 percent in the second week and more than 90 percent in the third week.\n\n\"When you look at the data, the ability of the test to detect the disease increases with time,\" says Jon Deeks, PhD, professor at University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom and lead author of the study. \"It's not surprising. You don't start with antibodies. You have to build them up.\"\n\nThat's what viral detection tests are for. Tests like reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests look for the virus in samples taken from a swab of your nose. Doctors can use this information to determine if you are currently infected with COVID-19 and potentially contagious. PCR tests are generally more sensitive if performed closer to the time when symptoms first appear, according to the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAntibody tests, on the other hand, can help identify if you were infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus by looking for antibodies, even if you never developed symptoms. These tests can compliment PCR test results. For example, if you had COVID-like symptoms and received a negative PCR test, there's a chance it may be a false negative. Your doctor may suggest an antibody test to confirm whether or not you've had a COVID-19 infection.\n\nAnd people seem to respond to SARS-CoV-2 differently. People who were asymptomatic (they didn't exhibit clinical symptoms of COVID-19) launched a weaker immune response \u2014 including lower levels of antibodies \u2014 compared to those who developed symptoms of the disease, in a June 2020 study in \u200bNature Medicine\u200b. In contrast, people who had severe and critical cases of COVID-19 had higher levels of certain antibodies compared to those with mild cases, per a May 2020 study in \u200bClinical and Translational Immunology\u200b.\n\nThe positive predictive value depends on the prevalence of the virus in the community. Where the prevalence rate is low there will be a higher false positive rate, Dr. Greninger explains. However, in locations where the prevalence is high, the tests are more likely to predict an accurate result.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Does a positive antibody test indicate that you're protected against COVID-19?
