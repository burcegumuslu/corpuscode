Do you know how fast a virus would spread through a police station or military barracks/mess hall if it were real?\n\nIn theory every military and police personnel sent out on the streets should be quarantined for 2 weeks before being allowed to retum to their police stations/army barracks to avoid spreading this \u201cHighly deadly and extremely virulent\u201d virus.\n\nYou would run out of military and police personal within a week if you had to quarantine them for 2 weeks after being exposed to the virus on the streets or subways not to mention arresting and dragging off people with no hazmat suits on.\n\nSoldiers with no gloves on riding the subway breathing recycled air with paper surgical masks on\u2026and they don\u2019t get infected and are not even quarantined before returning to their barracks where they could infect the entire military personnel.\n\nYou have the police walking around, no gloves on and touching the people\u2026whom we are told can be asymptomatic and carrying the virus. Taking their temperature is useless in detecting people infected during the incubation period where they show no signs and symptoms.\n\n Police not even wearing gloves and yet 40 hospital staff wearing hazmat suits get infected. Coronavirus: Nine members of Hong Kong family feared infected after sharing hotpot meal At least one of every two instances of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus is believed to occur while the first patient is not yet showing symptoms, according to an estimate by a group of Japanese university researchers. Based on its determination, the team, headed by Hokkaido University professor Hiroshi Nishiura, has called for preventive measures as well as reinforcing the medical care system against a potential sharp rise in coronavirus patients, rather than focusing exclusively on isolation as a way to contain the disease. According to the estimate based on 26 human-to-human infection cases released by six countries such as China, Thailand and the United States, the timing of the secondary infection was shorter than previously thought. Although the average period of incubation for the coronavirus originating from central China is believed to be about five days, the researchers found that second patients in more than half of the 26 human-to-human infection cases under study developed pneumonia symptoms within five days. The team concluded that these second patients were infected with the virus during its incubation period for the first patients. \u201cThe findings suggest that it is difficult to contain the illness simply by isolation,\u201d Nishiura said. \u201cWe need to put more emphasis on prevention of infection for people with high risks such as the elderly.\u201d \u201cIt is also important to prepare the medical care system so that we will not experience confusion even in the event of a greater number of pneumonia patients,\u201d he added. The number of people with the new coronavirus in mainland China has topped 31,000, with the death toll in the country rising to 636, according to the Chinese government. Many countries including Japan are struggling to contain the spread of the disease by isolating infected patients. A total of 14 out of 138 patients (10 percent) in a Wuhan hospital who were studied in the new paper presented with diarrhea and nausea Forty health care workers were infected with the novel coronavirus by patients at a single Wuhan hospital in January, a new study has found, underscoring the risks to those at the frontlines of the growing epidemic. One patient who was admitted to the surgical department was presumed to have infected 10 health care workers, according to the paper that was authored by doctors at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Friday.\n\u2022 Coronavirus: Two more people tested positive in Vancouver Coastal Health region\n\u2022 Coronavirus: Over 200 people tested in B.C., with four infected in VCH region Seventeen patients who were hospitalized for other reasons also became infected by the coronavirus. A total of 138 patients got the virus in a period spanning January 1 to January 28, with hospital-associated transmission accounting for 41 percent of all cases. The study comes just hours after a Chinese doctor who was punished for raising the alarm about the coronavirus died from the pathogen \u2014 sparking an outpouring of grief and anger over a worsening crisis that has now killed more than 630 people. Li Wenliang, 34, sent out a message about the new coronavirus to colleagues on December 30 in Wuhan but was later among a group of people summoned by police for \u201crumor-mongering.\u201d He later contracted the disease while treating a patient. Of the 40 infected health care workers in the JAMA study, 31 worked on general wards, seven in the emergency department, and two in the ICU. The example of the patient presumed to have infected 10 health workers highlighted the high level of danger within hospitals during the first phase of the epidemic, even though overall it is currently estimated that each patient infects on average 2.2 others. \u201cIf true, then this confirms that some patients are likely to be far more infectious than others, and this poses further difficulties in managing their cases,\u201d said Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK\u2019s Science Media Centre.
