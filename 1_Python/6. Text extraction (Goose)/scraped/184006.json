The Harvard study reported 2.74 MILLION serious adverse drug reactions per year come from properly prescribed drugs. And about 106,000 people DIE EVERY YEAR from drugs prescribed to them.\n\nIn addition to pharmaceutical drugs and medical error, vaccines are put into the mix. Vaccines do not create immunity, they create customers. It\u2019s the best business model in the world. It keeps people coming back for more \u2013 forever.\n\nThere are multiple toxic ingredients in vaccines \u2014 some known to cause cancer and autoimmune disorders. These toxins create health issues that in turn create customers.\n\nThe best defense against disease is a healthy, strong immune system, not overloaded with toxins from food, water, air, and pharmaceutical products.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "website", "title": "Home Page - Learn the Risk", "description": "THE REALITY OF OUR HEALTH The United States is\u00a0sicker than ever.\u00a0 The\u00a0U.S. spends more than any other country on healthcare\u00a0yet has more chronic health issues than any other country.
