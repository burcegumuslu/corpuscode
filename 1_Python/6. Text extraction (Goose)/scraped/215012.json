A person with CVID cannot make antibodies that can fight infection.\n\nIn turn, this makes them prone to recurring infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Later, the risk of infection becomes more severe, especially in the respiratory and digestive systems. Complications with CVID will lead to blood disorders and cancer, of which lymphoma is a common cause of death.\n\nWhile the main risk factor of CVID is a family history of the condition, it can happen to anyone, regardless of their family history, and the etiology of the disease is unknown. However, scientists believe that genetic factors that are linked to CVID include mutations in the genes that are involved in the development and function of the immune system.\n\nKnown risk factors and symptoms of common variable immunodeficiency\n\nSigns and symptoms of CVID may appear as early as childhood or adolescence; however, these are more common during adulthood.\n\nDuring childhood, the following signs and symptoms may appear:\n\u2022 An infection that keeps coming back. This can be anywhere in the eyes, skin, ears, sinuses, and lungs.\n\u2022 Inflammation in the joints of the knees, ankles, elbows, or wrists.\n\nThree complications must be observed in patients with CVID:\n\u2022 Recurrent infections \u2013 Prolonged exposure a condition (such as bronchitis) may lead to permanent damage to the organs and increase the risk of complications.\n\u2022 Autoimmune phenomena \u2013 Patients with CVID also have other autoimmune conditions. These can include anywhere from rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pyoderma gangrenosum, to even gastrointestinal diseases.\n\u2022 Malignancy \u2013 Some conditions that should be monitored include the development of lymphomas.\n\nMoreover, people with CVID may have granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissues of the skin, lungs, spleen, and liver.\n\nCVID primarily affects the immune system, but its complications hit all organ systems.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent or relieve common variable immunodeficiency\n\nProper diet can aid the body in boosting its immune system and managing the condition. Here are some recommended dietary habits.\n\u2022 Eating fresh fruit and vegetables as much as you can.\n\u2022 Adding more yellow- and orange-colored foods such as yellow squash, carrots, red peppers, and tomatoes for their nutrients such as alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.\n\u2022 Having more protein in your diet by consuming white meat, fish, and eggs.\n\u2022 Including foods rich in flavonoids such as berries, garlic, and yogurt.\n\nThe main treatment for CVID is intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy, which is known to cut down cases of recurrent infections. The procedure is effective for most people; however, a person with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease coupled with CVID may show little improvement with Ig replacement therapy. In this case, steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs are augmented with the therapy.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 High-risk kindergartener with immunodeficiency disease kicked out of school for not getting dangerous chicken pox vaccine\n\u2022 Measles outbreak in L.A. proves vaccine mandates don\u2019t work (but they do create a medical police state)\n\u2022 Are You at Risk for Toenail Fungus?\n\u2022 8 uses for Echinacea backed by science\n\nCommon variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a condition that impairs the immune system.
