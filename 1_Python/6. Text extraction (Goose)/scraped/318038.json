Is this true? Not quite in those terms, but the Switzerland&rsquo;s Federal Health Agency (Bundesgesundheitsamt, BAG) made material changes to the national vaccination schedule that certainly hasn&rsquo;t received mainstream press attention in North America.&nbsp; The agency has backed away from recommending COVID-19 vaccination this spring and summer. Of course, it&rsquo;s off-season for respiratory viruses, which could be part of the explanation. However, what else does the national Swiss health authority now promulgate on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination?\nAs mentioned above the BAG withdraws any COVID-19 recommendation for the spring and summer of 2023. However, the agency remains open for COVID-19 vaccine assessment for at-risk individuals, meaning the elderly, persons with comorbidities and those with immunosuppressed conditions."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
