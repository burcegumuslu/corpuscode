We may not physically hear bombs or see trains carrying prisoners, however they exist in a very subtle form. So subtle that one gets trapped before they realize the snare is before them. Those that walk, while practicing self-development are less likely to fall victim, the snares seldom capture the very self aware individual. It\u2019s not too late to free your mind and be liberated. Know this: You have within the most powerful force available. It is your heart. Written into your DNA is a code for truth. This code equals peace, contentment and unconditional love for self and others. Believe this. Trust this. Know this. Allow your heart to retrain your brain.\n\u2022 Vedic Astrology Report for April 2023\n\n April is a month of change and revelation, with several significant astrological events. Venus enters Taurus on April 5, promoting stability, loyalty, and artistic pursuits. The Sun transits through Aries from April 14 to May 14, encouraging self-expression and new beginnings. A solar eclipse occurs in Aries on April 19, followed by Jupiter entering Aries and Mercury turning retrograde on April 21. Jupiter's transit brings a desire for freedom, adventure, and self-improvement, while Mercury retrograde is a time for reflection and organization. The eclipse season begins with a focus on health and rejuvenation, as well as listening to our inner voice.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links":
