Living in a meticulously constructed fantasy world that world is starting to disintegrate and become\n\nNo, sir. He needs our thinking crazy when people start dying next month.\n\nI don\u2019t belong here here because I know some things that you don\u2019t know. Yes, my son sent me to the wrong year. You\u2019re certain of that science as an exact science. You had a bullet from\n\nWorld War One in your leg. James, how\n\ndid you get there?\n\nYou know the difference between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not said? delusions. He\n\nsaid you can explain trying to feature\n\nto go try your monkey. They mutate. We live underground.\n\nsort of do my part to get us back on top in charge of the planet.\n\nYou know what time it is? movie? Yes, we\u2019re gonna talk about 12 monkeys. You know, you\u2019ve probably seen it already. It\u2019s from the 90s. And we\u2019re gonna go through the whole movie plot spoilers right. Now we\u2019re gonna wait, we\u2019re just gonna get into it. What\u2019s this movie about? Well, let me tell you what it\u2019s all about. The nerds killing us. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. Is it worth it? Have you seen it yet? Well, I advise you highly to see it. This is a great movie top is a top 50 movie. Top 50. About top 10 the top 50 Sure. It\u2019s over two hours. There\u2019s a caveat there. You know, I don\u2019t like that. But that doesn\u2019t mean that should have been shaved down shorter. But yeah, two hours, would you should you pay for it? If you\u2019ve never seen it? Yes. pay for it. It\u2019s good. Great movie. It\u2019s worth watching a few times my opinion. I\u2019ve seen it maybe five to 10 times over my lifetime. Now from the red pill perspective, though, which is what we got today. And by the way, the movie poster itself, if you\u2019ll notice, has Bruce Willis with the all seeing eye highlighted with a sigil of the 12 monkeys. We will get into that because it is an initiatory tale of sorts, as you\u2019ll find out in the conclusion. All right. So what\u2019s the movie about if you if you decided, you just want to listen to my humble analysis and let\u2019s get into it. It\u2019s about well, okay, so let\u2019s let\u2019s see. It\u2019s 2035. And a virus has been released by an animal activist group called the 12 monkeys, that\u2019s sort of like the setup for this. And this virus forces mankind underground. The animals are the only thing left to live above ground. The animals and Mother Nature take back over take their rightful place, mankind the disgusting these that he is, must go underground. And underground, these scientists are trying to figure out how to combat this virus above ground. So they\u2019re sending prisoners above ground to collect samples and sort of study the origins of the virus. And they dangle the idea of a full pardon over over their heads and exchange. Some echoes of slavery there. Will your boy Bruce Willis, he\u2019s in this. And he plays guy named James Cole. A prisoner region for that, that big old dangling carrot. And he goes above ground against samples. That\u2019s kind of the gist of what this movies about. Oh, and by the way they can they can travel through time. Any perfect, but they\u2019re doing their best, right. So that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the setup. Now the film starts out and you see, you see James Cole, Bruce Willis, going back and forth, above ground below ground. You know where we\u2019re going with this as above so below hermetic axiom, as dictated by the God of magic, both the Hermes trismegistus to all the followers of the chemical process, rich will magic, Kabbalah, all these occult sciences believe in the concept, the macro connected to the micro, the practitioner on Earth, changing reality through the cosmos, you know, my schpeel, you\u2019ve been here before. So they\u2019re showing, I believe, figuratively, literal, sort of As above, so below connection here, which again, we\u2019ll get into that in the conclusion. But they send James cold back back in time to 1996. Right, because, again, we\u2019re in 2035. And they send James Cole Bruce Willis back to 1996. Because they\u2019re like, Look, you want your full part and you need to find this get more info on the 12 monkeys group that\u2019s going to unleash this virus. Or they screw up, they send them back to 1990. like God, Tupac still alive. What, what a time to be alive. And he ends up ends up in a mental hospital. Right, because he\u2019s in there talking about how he\u2019s telling people how he\u2019s from the future. And there\u2019s a virus unleashing and they\u2019re like, okay, buddy, here we go. We\u2019ll put you in this little van right here. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s padded, you\u2019re gonna hurt yourself. So they put him in this mental hospital. And here he needs Brad Pitt, aka Jeffrey Jones. Now, fun fact. They filmed this movie in at the Eastern State Penitentiary, right out there by Philly. And, you know, Ghost Adventures have been there. I think it was, who was in the prisoner. Al Capone was in there. You can do your ghost tours there. Your ghost hunting tours there. It\u2019s good time. But now you got to listen to what Brad Pitt\u2019s character. And by the way, one of Brad Pitt\u2019s greatest performances in this film. I mean, that\u2019s worth the price of admission, this guy can act his ass off. Anyways, you hear Jeffrey Jones, Brad Pitt, and I try to give you the names, right? So you can picture this. We\u2019re not that\u2019s my training wheels. We\u2019ll do that a little bit. Jeffrey Jones, Brad Pitt, he\u2019s talking to James Cole, Bruce Willis, about the games inside the you know, because they\u2019re in a little sort of like a mental nursing home sort of environment. And he\u2019s like, Hey, you know, we got some games over here. They got drugs to tranquilize you. He starts questioning who\u2019s the prison? Who\u2019s the prisoner? And who\u2019s the guard? Right. This is the Gnostic spin talks about the TV consumerism. And I\u2019m gonna play the clip for you here in a second. But it\u2019s it\u2019s kind of like the idea of social media, right? You\u2019re not paying for it. Therefore you are the product. And yeah, by the way, this is classic cinema history. This is one of the greatest cinematic moments and all of history, in my opinion, in my humble opinion.\n\ndo me a favor. Just show them around. Tell me TV rules. Show\n\nHow much you gonna pay me how much I\u2019d be doing your job\n\n$5,000 my man that enough? 5000 a wire check your counter as usual.\n\n$5,000 $5,000 $1,000 I\u2019ll give him the deluxe mental hospital. may get around get around. Let\u2019s see. Feel good. prisoners. No, you\u2019re the\n\ngods now. You got it. Okay, okay.\n\nGames want to get out. See more games, games, the vegetation. If you play the games voluntarily taking a train I guess they give some chemicals drinks or drugs what they give you how how much how much only George know your dose elementary telephone communication with the outside world back dispatch all of these nuts could just make phone calls it could spread insanity using through telephone cables losing two liters of oil these two are sane people infecting them. wackos everywhere plague a man\u2019s Come on. In fact, very cheap. And fuel this interaction actually mentally I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not mentally along for all I know you\u2019re\n\nhere that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\n\nYou\u2019re here because system. Television. All right. They\u2019re all right there. Look, let\u2019s kneel pray. anymore at least to make things anymore. It\u2019s all automated. What are we for then? We\u2019re consumers. Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff. You\u2019re a good citizen. But if you don\u2019t buy a lot of stuff, if you don\u2019t, what are you then I asked you what? l back Jim back if you don\u2019t buy things, toilet paper, new cards, computerized under electrically operated sexual devices, serial systems, your brain and planet headphones, screwdrivers miniature built in radar devices. voice activated computers. Take\n\nSo for one particular television programs, it\u2019s almost something new. You go to the charts and stuff date time. So you want to see us on but you have to tell them before the show is scheduled. Beyond there\u2019s this guy, and he\u2019s always requesting shows that already played? Yes. No. You have to tell her before. He couldn\u2019t quite grasp the idea that the charge nurse couldn\u2019t make it be yesterday. couldn\u2019t turn back time. Thank you Weinstein. Now he he was nuts. He was a fruitcake, Jim. Want to get\n\nRight. Right. Right. Right. I got a little carried away, explaining the inner workings of the institution to Jim.\n\nNow what\u2019s what\u2019s curious? Is that and we\u2019re not going to unpack that whole thing. You\u2019re intelligent enough? You know what we\u2019re saying about all this? All these curious elements like questioning Who? Who\u2019s in the prison? Who\u2019s the guard? Well, like this is a gnostic spin. This is inverted reality. We\u2019re on this prison planet, right? It\u2019s basically you know, questioning authority questioning everything you\u2019ve been told. Is everything a distraction? Are they trying to tranquilize you? Are you just being the consumer you\u2019re used as livestock? And what\u2019s curious is that Brad Pitt actually spent some time at a psych ward in Philly preparing for this role. You know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re bad things happen in Philadelphia. But he wasn\u2019t actually paid much for this film. Because this was 1985. And his his big. His big films hadn\u2019t dropped yet. Interview with a vampire was in the can still seven was in the can still, when he was working on this movie. This this guy was crushing it Oh, my God, how busy was this guy? And I would argue that this speech that he gives, fits into David Fincher Fight Club, which, you know, obviously Brad Pitt was, uh, was playing the role of Tyler Durden. In this speech, he\u2019s dropping massive ideas about you know, how the games they sort of put us in a vegetative state, which you\u2019ve seen, you know, what we\u2019re talking about, when you see people getting absorbed into like tik tok or the Facebook or the Instagram, the phones, they\u2019re programming us. I remember. I remember back before I had an iPhone back in the BlackBerry days, when you just use the phone for the utility of what you needed it for. I had a friend with an iPhone. He was consumed with it. He was always on and I thought what could possibly be that interesting. But I get it right. It\u2019s not a condemnation of it. I\u2019m just as guilty. I spend hours on that thing. But but it\u2019s by design. They know how to do this to us. That\u2019s what Brad Pitt knew back in 1995. Who\u2019s the prisoner who\u2019s the guard the prisoner is firmly planted inside the system and perpetuates the system is like some real Charles Charles Manson stuff here, right? Which Oh, by the way, before I forget, there is a connection here. If you consider Charles Manzo started the air trees, water animals stuff, the hippie environmental stuff. And there\u2019s some arguments that that\u2019s what this film could be about is like, how we\u2019re treating Mother Nature and eventually Mother Nature is going to fight back. And that\u2019s kind of what the the modus operandi of the 12 monkeys animal activist group is right. But the idea is or if you don\u2019t conform, you, therefore are the deranged one. And they have to keep you outside the system. You are the outlier, because you have not conformed and fit into what the the masses Dean normal. Hence, censorship. That\u2019s why they censor the truth is because we don\u2019t fit into the mass consensus of reality, too dangerous for the masses. They refer to as mental diversions in the film. And what we\u2019re curious is that Brad Pitt\u2019s character even is talking about Siri, he talks about voice activated commercials. Did you catch that? And listen to it again? Let\u2019s do it. 100 times all you want. Anyways, great clip there. One of my favorite moments in cinematic history. Was Brad Pitt on my list. Leo\u2019s number one, Tom Cruise number two Brad Pitt\u2019s probably number three. Now look, just because they\u2019re all incredibly handsome. That does not mean I\u2019m gay. They they\u2019re all just phenomenal actors. I can\u2019t explain it. Okay, James Cole, Bruce Willis. He is at the so he\u2019s at the mental hospital, and they bring him into the board to review them. So you can like plead his case, why he\u2019s not crazy anymore. And we notice because we\u2019re all very well care. That this is more symbolism of as above so below, because the board of the board of doctors, they\u2019re above ground at the mental hospital. They\u2019re talking to him. And just previous to this, he was talking to the Board of scientists belowground I\u2019ll put the photos on the Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt you\u2019ve already liked and you\u2019ve already subscribed the link was in the show notes Remember that? But that is again more symbolism as above so below, the scientist underground coal has to petition with them and be like, Look, you need to send me above ground and give me a shot blah, blah, blah. He does same thing in the mental hospital. Hey, you need to let me out. Give me a shot blah, blah, blah. But But coals dumb as these they\u2019re telling him how he\u2019s from the future. So you can guess how far how well that served him. And they\u2019re like, okay, bro. You got it, buddy. So it\u2019s nighttime and they\u2019re in the hospital. Still. He doesn\u2019t get out. Plot spoiler. And James Cole Bruce Willis is talking to Brad Pitt, Jeff goans goans spelled coins, but they pronounce it guns. Guns, I don\u2019t know. And then when he\u2019s talking and we hear a little bit of like, almost a bit of like on the terrain theory, germ theory stuff. Remember, shout out Greg Carr wood from the higher side chats he he appeared on our show, just a few weeks back talking about this stuff about germ theory and terrain theory. And here\u2019s here\u2019s your boy Brad Pitt talking to Bruce Willis about it. This is similar to how how James Cole is trying to explain how I turn the future like people just don\u2019t. They can\u2019t understand and grasp this reality.\n\nDo you know what crazy is craziest majority rules? Yeah. Take germs for example. Germs in 18th century, no such thing. Not nothing would ever imagine such a thing. No sane person and welcome to stuck some ways, some ways. Some ways someone is trying to convince people while other doctors mainly that there are these teeny tiny invisible bad things called germs again to your body make you sick. He\u2019s trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy crazy, teeny tiny invisible what he called germs. Now, at the 20th century, last week is broken right into the shell. When I order a burger in this fast food joint, a guy dropped it on the floor. Jim, he picks it up, he wipes it off. He hands it to me like it was all okay. What about the germs? I say he says, I don\u2019t believe in germs, germs, just apply a made up thing. So you just packed it and soaked. Now, he\u2019s crazy, right? There\u2019s no right. There\u2019s no wrong there\u2019s only popular if you believe in germs, right?\n\nI\u2019m not crazy. Of course.\n\nOf course not. You want to escape? Right? That\u2019s Barry saying that I can help you. You want me to get you out?\n\nNow again, it\u2019s the same concept reinforced from the previous speech that Jeffrey guns gave to James Cole. The, you know, crazy is majority rule, sometimes consensus reality, which is why you see the mainstream media pushing one narrative generally are trying to write. I mean, there\u2019s there\u2019s bounds and limits within this consensus reality. But that\u2019s the idea. Now, and this is why censorship happens, right? Because you have these people out here pushing alternative views of the world. And that\u2019s not good for business, right? It\u2019s not good for the manipulation. goans he wants to help Cole get out. So what he does is he creates chaos in the hospital and the staff is distracted. And he he physically gives key cold the key to get out. So cold, he\u2019s trying to get out. But he\u2019s all doped up. He\u2019s all Thorazine dealt. And what\u2019s curious is that they do this during a commercial that is playing on the day room TV about financial investments and financial opportunities, because again, this is another, you know, American capitalist culture critique. So that the returns fast. American capital, yeah. Another patient, he repeats the commercial, right? So they\u2019re showing us how the masses are like, they just repeat what the Devi tells them. And also, they talked about how the Florida Keys are beautiful this time of year, which is a theme you\u2019ll see in the movie. Basically, it\u2019s the eye, they\u2019re showing us much like they live the repeated messages, talking to us, manipulating us controlling us. Now, he tries to get out. James Cole\u2019s trying to get out but he\u2019s all doped up the catch them, they throw them on a pad itself and boom, he\u2019s gone. disappears. Because the scientist from 2035, they zap him back underground to 2035 to report on what happened. He\u2019s like, hey, dummy, you sent me the 1990 and 1996. Because again, they haven\u2019t perfected time travel yet. So they are like, okay, we\u2019ll send you back. This time, we\u2019re going to send you right to the right spot. 1996 Baltimore is the exact moment when the virus is supposed to be unleashed. Get that Intel report back, full bharden. Boom. And then here we get to learn more about the other main character of the show. Dr. Catherine railly. She is the doctor of the sick. She was at the mental hospital. And she kind of is curious about James Cole. She\u2019s like, something resonates true with this guy. It\u2019s kind of sympathy for him back in 1990. So boom, James calls back in 1986. And we hear Dr. Catherine railly, giving a a lecture about apocalypse apocalyptic diseases.\n\nIn a season of great pestilence, there are omens and divinations and one of the four beasts into the seven angels seven golden vials of the wrath of God, who live forever and ever.\n\nin the 14th century, or the accounts of local officials of that time, this man appeared suddenly in the village of wild near Stonehenge in April of 1362. Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent, the mandate dire prognostications about a pestilence, which he said would wipe out humanity approximately 600 years. Obviously, this plague doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling when reality supports it with a virulent disease whether it\u2019s the bubonic plague, smallpox or AIDS, and now we have technological powers as well, such as chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head during the deadly mustard gas attacks of World War One during that attack in the French trenches in October of 1917. We have an account of this soldier who during the assault was wounded by shrapnel and hospitalized apparently in the state of asteria. doctors found that he had lost all comprehension of French, but that he spoke English fluently. I\u2019ll be a regional dialect they didn\u2019t recognize. The man though, physically unaffected by the gas was beside himself. He claimed that he had come from the future that he was looking for pure germ that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the earth starting in the year 1996.\n\nAbout the seven golden vials that man needs to live forever, oh my god, these nerds are creating the mortality juice, the juice, baby. So that was curious. And we\u2019re gonna play this clip right now. She is signing books after the lecture. And you hear some curious stuff happened with this interchange with some of the the the attendees trying to get their book signed.\n\nReady to get vaccinated? Hi,\n\nI think Dr. railly is giving alarmist a bad name? Surely,\n\nthere\u2019s very real and very convincing data, the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race. This is true proliferation of atomic devices by uncontrolled breeding habits, promotion of land, sea and air, the rape of the environment. In this context, Isn\u2019t that obvious? The chicken middle represents the same vision. And that Homo sapiens model. Let\u2019s go shopping. It\u2019s the cry of the true lunatic.\n\nI wonder if you\u2019re aware of my\n\nThe first guy you hear briefly, he\u2019s like, oh, boy, he\u2019s scared. And he\u2019s like, I\u2019m gonna get my vaccines, right. Which has its own implications. We won\u2019t get into that we hear the this sort of technocrat type character, another main character in the show, but like, we don\u2019t know much about him at this point, called ponytail. I don\u2019t know what his name is, doesn\u2019t really matter. We\u2019ll call him ponytail. Because he\u2019s got a beautiful one beautiful, 90s ponytail. He\u2019s talking about, he reveals the true justification these these psychopaths have for creating creating a new reality. And he\u2019s like, Oh, you know, viruses are so bad mankind needs put in his place. Because all we do is shop and destroy the Earth. Cap consumerism, capitalism. I mean, the real question is like, Is he right? Is he right? Is he wrong? Leave for that for you to decide. But then James Cole. He forces he forces the doctor to drive into Philly again, because he wants to go with the bad things happen. And by the way, was Trump alleged to be a time traveler or Baron Trump, his son. Just a fun little fun little play there on ideas. It was a book, a book by Ingersoll Lockwood called mysterious. What was it called some about Baron Trump in his mysterious travels underground or something? Very curious. Other than that, I think there\u2019s a lot of similarities. I didn\u2019t read the book. But if you see any, let me know. Hit me up. Now. James Cole, he\u2019s in the car. Dr. So and so she\u2019s driving him around. And he\u2019s reflecting on how much he misses humanity, because you got to understand he\u2019s been living underground in this prison for decades. And he misses simple things like the music on the radio. It\u2019s very soothing to him. And look, I a personal story, personal side note, I remember when I was in basic training, non hearing music for I mean, it was it was like a month at least. And then one day, I overheard music and I think it was one of the drill instructors was playing. I don\u2019t remember. It doesn\u2019t matter. I heard music and it was like this profound experience. It was so beautiful. I was like remember the song that\u2019d be a funny story. But yeah, when you get to prime to those things, I couldn\u2019t imagine for years. There\u2019s a legitimate response and a pleasing factor in your brain. So that was interesting. Cool story, bro. James Cole. He wants to go to Philly to find the virus. He wants to find the 12 monkeys. And oh, by the way, he\u2019s got this voice in his head throughout the whole film, Bob, and Bob\u2019s talking to him. And we don\u2019t really know we don\u2019t get closure on what this is. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s him being legitimately crazy. Or, I would argue that the scientists programmed and unknown because you find now that there\u2019s supposed to be spying devices hidden, embedded in the, in their, in their teeth in the future. You remember Margot Kidder, who was a star of the film, Superman. She smashed her teeth out in the woods, talking about how the Illuminati or whoever was putting implants in her teeth. Remember that? What\u2019s up with that? their connection there. I didn\u2019t see any but that was very curious that they put the spy devices in the tooth. So so it\u2019s argued to Bob the voice in his head comes from his own teeth. Now, Bruce, or I\u2019m sorry, James Cole. And Dr. So and so they\u2019re looking for the 12 monkeys group, because again, they according to the history, they had the original virus before mutated and got out of control. And the scientists 2035 need to understand it. So then get humanity back above ground. And along the way, James Cole, he\u2019s got to kill some thugs to protect the doctor. And, you know, she doesn\u2019t know whether to she\u2019s scared of him or not, because right now she\u2019s sort of kidnapped. But she comments how like, yo, he\u2019s gonna have to kill those people. And then James Cole says, All I see are dead people, meaning he lived through the apocalypse already. Like he\u2019s from the future. It doesn\u2019t matter. It was dead anyway. curious enough though. Hailey Joe Osmond character in the sixth sense. also said something very similar, right? You remember that? And he said, I see dead people. And this was in 1999. The Sixth Sense was released. So this was after right. Also, by the way, filmed in Philly, sent in Philly. Also, by the way, Joe, Hailey Joe Osmonds character and Sixth Sense guess what his name was? Cole Cole sear again strange echoes and reverberations in the you know, I don\u2019t know Mandela Effect whatever you want to call this in the consciousness So James Coleman director sounds Oh, they\u2019re looking for I didn\u2019t catch her name by the way. That\u2019s why I keep calling her Dr. So and so they locate the the animal rights group it\u2019s called FHA at the time before it turns into the 12 monkeys and of course they find out it\u2019s run by Guess who Jeffrey Jones because apparently he got out at some point of the mental hospital and he was saying that he had a wealthy virologist father while in the mental hospital right he said my father\u2019s famous I\u2019m getting out of here turns out he was right and now curious idea here there\u2019s also the we talked about Manson in the air tree waters animal group there\u2019s also the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary down in southern Utah very famous place. Well look who started that process church church that believe that Satan was God and all this wacky stuff that allegedly also Charles Manson was a member of or familiar with. They did. They did publish a magazine with an article written by Charles Manson. Now, now, this is so curious to me, because like, I\u2019ve got these granola ways, and it\u2019s like, Okay, do I support these? These dannic ideas? Can I have it both ways? Can I love animals in the environment and earth? And also love Jesus? Why are these two things incompatible? Now, these are big questions. Big Questions, big problems. Yeah, anyway, so the viral ologists doctor father. turns out he\u2019s buddies with old ponytail, the technocrat guy who was asking for the booksigning who suggested the man deserve to die for the way he treats Eritrea waters and animals. And one of the animal rights people, ironically, who was in this FAA animal rights group, was played by a guy named Matt Ross. Do you? Do you know who Matt Ross is? I\u2019m about to tell you he was in American Psycho. Another great film. Easily a top 50 film. He plays this dude, that\u2019s kind of gay. And he was also and guess what else? Guess what else Matt out my rossell face off. Yes. He couldn\u2019t eat a peach for hours. I\u2019m so terrible. I was terrible, the Nick Cage voice. But there it is. He was in face off and Silicon Valley as the Steve Jobs type CEO granola guy. So yeah, I thought that was curious. This must be one of his first roles. He barely had any lines in it. So James Cole Dr. So and so they get back in the car. And Tom Mahal, Jeffrey Jones said that his father was God. But he\u2019s just a scientist. You see how they\u2019re conflating the two? Much like, Matt Ross has character in Silicon Valley, the show was playing portraying Steve Jobs. There\u2019s this. There\u2019s this sort of God plot Cobb, God complex with these technical paths that\n\npeople who feel unaccessible You can\u2019t just barge in on him. It\u2019s not how the world works required. No, you\n\ncar is stolen. We are in big trouble. Big trouble. You don\u2019t turn yourself over to the police. They\u2019re going to kill you and you\u2019re going to shoot me an accessory to murder. Nobody is going to die.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to save the world. Okay,\n\nbits and pieces in your head? No.\n\nLet me give you an example. Jeffrey Goins, the book patient mechanicals\n\nhe told you then his father was a famous scientist who work with viruses corporated that good information to this\n\nchange. Father was a scientist. He said his father was\n\na prominent psychiatrist and author. And you see how things how things intermix and intermingle and, and it gets very confusing because you\u2019ve got these people like Elon Musk, and all these types that are making technology that makes our lives better yet it also marches down the path of transhumanism. Much like my conflict between liking to protect animals in the environment, but somehow that marches me down the path of Satanism. Now the virologist doctor, biologists father go Doctor goans, the doctor dad who thought he was God. He is at a dinner an elitist dinner, given a speech, and you\u2019re gonna hear some curious elements here. He\u2019s talking about how these elites, they\u2019re responsible for the masses, they\u2019ve been chosen, right? That\u2019s kind of their attitude. And then you\u2019ll also if you listen very closely, here, reference to the archetype of Lucifer himself.\n\nEnjoy this opulent dinner, this most\n\nstimulating and exciting company, for itself with no sense of\n\nWith all his excess of public attention and cacophony of praise, comes great responsibility.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t have to tell you all that the dangers of science, Tom Warren threat from from atheists stealing\n\nfire from the Gulf and\n\nDr. Strangelove terror, but never before.\n\nYou heard it, he compares promethease taking the fire from the gods to himself. That\u2019s what these guys think. They talk about Dr. Strangelove a bit and fear and power and what\u2019s going on and how they need to be the adults in the room. And again, maybe they\u2019re right. Humans on a massive scale. Sometimes can\u2019t get things right. I prefer my freedom personally, over a nanny state. But I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re entirely wrong, like, people do dumb things. People do selfish things. Sometimes when they\u2019re up against the wall. Not everyone\u2019s perfect. you extrapolate that to billions of people. You can see why it\u2019s so enticing for these people that are in these positions of power to want to control us. I\u2019m not defending it. I\u2019m not advocating for it. I\u2019m just saying this is their viewpoint. They think they\u2019re not wrong. They think they\u2019re right. And that\u2019s why James Cole, he meets up with Jeffrey Jones, talk about these monkeys 12 monkeys just get the info and Bomi exam back to 2035. And at this point Dr. railly she that\u2019s her name. I just found Dr. So and so there Dr. railly. Dennis, I said I didn\u2019t have a name I had a written down earlier. Anyway, Dr. railly she starts to realize like, Oh my god, James Cole. He really is a time traveler. Now Now she\u2019s on Team Cole. She thinks he\u2019s like the deuce Ex Machina, however you pronounce that. The God from the machine right coming to save mankind. Meanwhile, coals back underground. Well, meanwhile, he\u2019s in the 2035. He\u2019s back on the ground. And they\u2019re calling him a hero because he actually made contact with the 12 monkeys, he won victory. He gave them what they wanted. He\u2019s gonna get the full part. But James Cole being the hero that he is. He obstacle back in time back above ground To get more info. Meanwhile, the viral ologists he\u2019s talking to ponytail. And you confirm they\u2019re linked together as harbingers of this revolution. Right? Because this whole time you\u2019re thinking it\u2019s Brad Pitt\u2019s crazy character. You\u2019re thinking Jeffrey guns is the guy to unleash the virus. But no, no, no. It\u2019s his father, the virologist, the wealthy elitist, and the other techno path, old ponytail. who think that mankind\u2019s virus needs to be checked that mankind is checked. And the other ones do it. And Dr. Cells Oh, she is older damn name, I got to take better notes, guys. I\u2019m very sorry. Anyway, Dr. Stone, so she\u2019s, she\u2019s spray paint the outside of the building, you know, why do 5 billion people have to die. And if you recall, I thought of the Georgia guidestones, which had these ominous messages about the future. And I looked it up, I thought, wow, then that some 5 billion note didn\u2019t, it says the population needs to be reduced to less than 500 million, which is a that\u2019s a very low number. But it does make me think of this movie. Maybe that\u2019s what the unleashing of the virus is meant to do. Maybe that\u2019s what they want. They we always hear about that population reduction. Right. And you\u2019ve heard Bill Gates talk about the vaccine for population reduction, which many people get wrong, they think that he\u2019s saying like the vaccine is gonna kill people. That\u2019s not as his his justification, his version of why he said that. He\u2019s saying that other cultures that have many, many kids will have less kids, because those kids are going to be healthier in their because apparently, in some of these cultures, they\u2019ll have like 10 kids, knowing that like two of them were gonna die from some disease. With the idea that eventually they\u2019ll say all these kids aren\u2019t going to die of the disease. Let\u2019s only have the kids or whatever. Kind of it\u2019s all very suspect. Yeah, there\u2019s Georgia guidestones. Everyone\u2019s talking about the universal language, the world core, being imbalanced with nature and all this stuff. And I\u2019ll put the photo on the Instagram of the spray paint thing of her spray painting 5 billion. Not that you need that. Who cares, right. Jeffrey guns he talks about, about his mind being put into a probability matrix. This guy sees the future right? He knows. He talks about how they\u2019re going to predict thoughts and behaviors which is essentially what social media is doing. They\u2019re harvesting data. They\u2019re essentially putting your mind into a digital matrix already.\n\nseen that before?\n\nNine a Ford is chasing her\n\nwacko irresponsible schemes. And now God knows what she\u2019s written out there. And that was\n\nlast week I told her about the army of the 12 monkeys and possible Do you know why do you know why? Because you pathetically effectual and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals. I\u2019ll tell you why. Because when I had anything to do with their six years ago, there was no such thing. I hadn\u2019t even thought of it. Then how come she knows what\u2019s going on? But here\u2019s my theory on that. When I was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health. I was interrogated, I was X ray. I was examined thoroughly. Then They took everything about me and put it into computer where they created this model of my mind. Yes, use that model, they managed to generate every thought I could possibly have in the next, say 10 years, which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind to determine everything I was going to do in that period. So you see, she knew I was gonna leave the army, the 12 monkeys into the pages of history before ever even occurred to me. She knows everything I\u2019m ever going to do before I know it myself. That question, you finish here, I\u2019ll meet you there. And if you forget one thing, I will have you shaved, sterilized and destroy what your great man\n\nJeffrey guns, he knows the script. They\u2019re using our data to predict our actions and therefore control us. And in their defense, they claim it\u2019s for our own protection, because we\u2019re just untrustworthy. So James Cole, he comes back again, to 1996. He\u2019s fully red pill, the doctor she believes in him. But now he doubts himself. He doesn\u2019t believe his own self. And at this point, we really confirm that the movie has a hard on for keywest we see a couple commercials in the movie. At this point, we see a travel poster, and that is where they are attempting to flee. James Coleman Dr. So and so they\u2019re going to go down to the key west to write it out and see what happens. Old nano Boomer Ville I\u2019ve been there was a good time. Boomer Ville was Boomer Central. We find out it wasn\u2019t I\u2019m speaking another side note. Remember that there\u2019s a thing called salt life that\u2019s like every Key West boomers wearing assault life t shirt. When you get out of the game one of the founders of salt life a boomer Of course, right in his 50s apparently there\u2019s allegations that he shot his 18 year old girlfriend or his girlfriend shot an 18 year old girl he was having an affair with a son like that. It boomers man they they\u2019re living their best lives out here. That\u2019s around 18 year old girls are talking about Salt Lake. Oh, yeah. Key West, right. So they\u2019re going to Key West. So in 2035, apparently they don\u2019t have any more salt life shirts in Key West, but in 1996 they do. They do. So they\u2019re going down to Key West. And we find out as they\u2019re traveling down there. They hear on the radio that the 12 monkeys, they weren\u2019t releasing the virus. They were just living animals out of the zoo. Right? They were just a bunch of activist punks. So Brad Pitt this whole time has been a good guy. Or not that bad of a bad guy who should say they\u2019re just trying to release the animals man. Now the real virus super spreader. The real psychopaths are the techno past the old pony tail and the biologist, elitist father is your Jonas Salk type folks, Bill Gates, all these guys. So they\u2019re the ones really that are going to make this happen. And James Cole, he starts hearing the voices of Bob in his hand. And he\u2019s yelling at some guy in the toilet in the bathroom and the guy. He\u2019s, he\u2019s dropping a dose and he\u2019s so scared. He doesn\u2019t even wash his hands. I\u2019m like God, filthy human animals. Maybe they deserve it. He just runs out of the bathroom. But he hears these voices of Bob and we think of Project Blue Beam and then Elan musk neuro link I talked about Blue Beam in my alien book. how that fits into voices in your head and all that stuff. That\u2019s in aliens. UFOs near call us illusion one if you\u2019re curious. Now, James Cole he\u2019s supposed to be he\u2019s supposed to shoot and kill old ponytail at the airport because he\u2019s having these flashbacks from childhood memories, right? This whole time. And another time traveler comes back and he gives him the gun because he\u2019s at the airport trying to go to Key West remember? And the other guy\u2019s like, row kill ponytail. From the future. You got to do this. Get your pardon. And James goes trying to catch up the point I was gonna shoot him he\u2019s gonna do it. save humanity. But then foam security guards see all this go down and they shoot and kill James Cole. Cops, right. Good for killing now. Now the final scene is very revealing. We\u2019re gonna play the clip here. And what you\u2019re about to hear is 1996 James Cole just been shot and killed by the cops ponytail successfully got onto his flight with his suitcase with the virus because he\u2019s about to spread it all over the world. And he sits next to a woman and she She turns out to share his same disdain for the human population.\n\nshootings even at airports Now, you\n\nmight say that we\u2019re the next endangered species. Human beings.\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head.\n\nJohn\u2019s is my name.\n\nThat was curious as this lady looks identical to one of the scientists on the panel and 2035 underground, put on the show, like subtitles and such. Like it, uh, you know, it shows her in the future as a botanist or something like that, right? But on the movie clip, in 1996, she says she\u2019s into insurance, which I found curious. But you you hear the disdain for the human population, and therefore the virus is about to spread. This is every techno past fantasy. And then we\u2019re going underground forever. Okay. Now, in conclusion, let\u2019s wrap up with this, what you just watched. I watched this movie when I was like 18 or something like that. I remember being very bizarre, very hard to follow. And I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m a genius now, but I was. I was perplexed at how confusing the storyline was with the first time I watched it the first couple of times when it came out. Maybe it was because they were talking about viruses and quarantines, and it seemed like Bizarro science fiction. But we see how all that is not so much the case, right? It\u2019s not so much Bizarro sci fi anymore. But the big idea here, it shows what appears to be a mentally disturbed person who\u2019s actually the purveyor of truth. It\u2019s talking about perspective and consensus reality. And you\u2019ll notice how in the movie James calls memories, because it\u2019s kind of weird. If you haven\u2019t seen the movie, when he\u2019s a child, he\u2019s at the airport in Key West, and he witnesses himself from the future, trying to shoot all ponytail. But you\u2019ll see how these memories sort of keeps replaying throughout the movie, and it morphs over time. And this is just like what I talked about in user illusion. One, when I talked about how Brian Williams, the journalist, had that false memory of the helicopter shootings. He swore he was in a helicopter, they got shot down in Iraq or whatever. But it was just because he had reported on it so much and heard so much about it that over time, his brain gave him this false memory syndrome. Now, ironically, in the same book I wrote, I cite Dr. Diana pusaka, who talked about the 100th monkey. In her book American cosmic I\u2019m going to read you. The hundreds monkey was part of a backlash against the alien abduction cultural narrative, but hypnotic regression has persisted as a convention of alien abduction investigations. as scholars of film studies have begun to work with scholars have memory, the results may shed light on hypnotic regression and alien abduction. A recent edition of the journal memory studies was devoted to scholarship on memory and film, The editors write, quote, over the past two decades, the relationship between cinema and memory has been the object of increasing academic attention. The growing interest of film cinema repositories for representing shaping, creating, recreating, or indexing forms of individual and collective memories. So we kind of get a taste of this. And that\u2019s what my argument is in user illusion. One, we won\u2019t get into that now. But like the argument is that entertainment is indoctrinating us with thoughts beliefs, which will become reality of aliens and UFOs. Now, these tech Topaz, are they entirely wrong in their belief that humans are dreadful animals? I don\u2019t think they\u2019re entirely wrong. I know that\u2019s controversial. I\u2019m very sorry. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re entirely wrong. We do horrific things. Sometimes we do our best but men flawed, okay. We just are. My problem with them is how they try to handle it and how they try to control us. Like it\u2019s just is what it is like people were as human beings were a mess, right? And that\u2019s okay. And I love it. I think that\u2019s great. We\u2019re all just trying to do our best. But they want perfection. They want control. troll. They sell it to you with the illusion of safety, because it is an illusion, my friends. Now what\u2019s funny is that James Cole, who, I\u2019d argue is the Jesus Christ character, which we\u2019re going to discuss next. On my final talking point, he\u2019s trying to save humanity from itself. Well, guess what, so are the techno paths, they\u2019re doing the same thing. They both think they\u2019re doing the right thing. The techno paths, they\u2019re on the satanic path. They\u2019re destroying God\u2019s creation to rebuild it because God\u2019s creation is such a mess. Mankind has the worst. They want to scorch the earth and remove this material limitation of the human body on this prison planet. They bind to that Gnosticism argument you got to release the spirit trapped from the confines of the flesh Where\u2019s James Cole he\u2019s more the Christ figure. He\u2019s trying to save humanity from itself as well just in a different fashion. Finally, last point, the religious element here we have as above so below many times in this right and I\u2019ll give you another photo on the Instagram as it was on the the imagery we see of James Cole above ground and below ground you\u2019ll notice when he enters both dimensions there they\u2019re washing them down the scrubbing them down at the hospital above ground there Washington scrubbing them down underground and 2035 with them sweet buttcheeks Bruce Willis must have been hitting him squats hard in the 90s right? He didn\u2019t skip leg day. Got them glutes. Now you guys are gonna think I\u2019m gay? For sure. Now, forget it. Now this is all about the initiatory tale of verse wills. Okay, verse one says the Christ figure. You\u2019ve seen it on the movie poster with the all seeing I\u2019m walking up is the monkey sigil from the 12 monkeys logo. But you\u2019ll notice it was called 1212 monkeys and you know that\u2019s got significance. Because represents 12 disciples now in the mystery religion. They look to the number 13 and as the representation of the persecution of the Mystery Schools because Christ plus his 12 disciples is 13. Because the mystery religion, it\u2019s all about the heavens, again, there\u2019s your as above stuff, and the 12 houses of the zodiac and how each sign influences different areas of the sky. And all this new age Aquarius stuff. But James Cole, JC is your Jesus Christ character, okay? Because he plays the transcendent figure, beyond our limited understanding of space and time. And much like Jesus Christ himself when he died, he went underground to hell, to, to redeem, Adam and Eve the original centers from hell and redeem all of mankind, give them path to salvation, so that you can go to heaven when you die, when you repent of your sins. And notice the God in Jesus. They weren\u2019t like they weren\u2019t saying, hey, shame on you for being bad. They\u2019re just saying, you have to acknowledge that man is born short of the glory of God, full sin. And you just do your best and you ask for repentance. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all you gotta do. We\u2019re only on this earth for a limited time before we slip into the next dimension. He\u2019s not asking perfection. Right? I\u2019m gonna put on my preschooler Hang on a minute. Let me grab it real quick. It was the 12 monkeys they are there. There\u2019s kind of like a reference right? You got James called JC Jesus Christ. And then you got the 12 monkeys 12 disciples. And they\u2019re following the seat of knowledge that James Cole dropped on Jeffrey Jones at the mental hospital way back in 1990. Right this further proves my point that James calls Jesus Christ character. Because we\u2019re call and I\u2019m gonna play I\u2019ll play the clip for you. Jeffrey guns. He says at this party in 1996 because you know, Jeffrey guns gets out of the mental hospital. And in 1986 when James Cole gets sent back to find the 12 monkeys and Jeffrey guns. Jeffrey Jones confirms this at a house party and basically says, Hey, James Cole, you\u2019re the one that dropped the seed of knowledge upon me way back in 1990 in the mental hospital\n\nGiannis black tie I mean I said drop by but it\u2019s like that big do that senators Secret Service Yeah, hungry on we\u2019ll killer feast we\u2019re putting on tonight lots of dead lamb dead counted pig.\n\nHi, how are you?\n\non the hospital, yeah. Am I right? Anything about what you\u2019re going to do? I can\u2019t change anything. I won\u2019t stop you. I can\u2019t stop you. I just want the information. Ladies, so nice to see you again. Remember to watch your step on the way down. All right? Well, I just want access to the pure virus virus. Yes. For the future. I need to know where it isn\u2019t exactly what it is. I didn\u2019t get it. I see what you\u2019re up to. It\u2019s your old plan, isn\u2019t it? Yes, you do. We were in the day room watching television. And you were all upset about the desecration of the planet which I understand. But then you said to me, wouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a germ or a virus and wipe all of mankind, like the animals on the trees, just trying to confuse me?\n\nI told you my poem was this famous biologist and he said, Hey, he can make it and we can steal it.\n\nworld belongs to the dogs and cats. Just like worms.\n\nSo there you go. Confirmation. James Cole\u2019s Jesus Christ. 12 monkeys are the 12 disciples. James Cole transcends the limitations of space and time to show man the path of salvation and the techno paths. They\u2019re the worst. Right? So there you go. That\u2019s the whole movie. What a trip. What a trip yet time travel. You got ponytail tech, no pants. We got the idea of creating a new world A new reality. based upon what these techno past thinks is best for us, because we\u2019re such a mess. Which is very fitting if you give into the ideas of the New World Order the pursuits of the elite, globalist new goals, want to pursue a communist Marxist agenda, no trashing the future, through the Davos through the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab. And the great reset and all this stuff. That\u2019s the argument. Right? Which reality Do you believe in? Which one do you subscribe to? That\u2019s up to you to decide what you think about these things? What do you think long hard about these things? these are these are big concepts in this film, so I highly recommend it.
