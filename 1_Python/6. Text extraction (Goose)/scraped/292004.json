It\u2019s unclear how many birds would be targeted \u2013 with around 10billion chickens alone produced in America each year solely for meat.\n\nFears about the bird flu outbreak reached an apex last month, when an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died from the avian flu and her father also tested positive.\n\nBoth were found to have an older clade of H5N1 which was not responsible for the current global outbreak and they were both believed to have been infected by a bird.\n\nBut the cases highlight the danger of a zoonotic spillover.\n\nVaccinating the tens of millions of domesticated poultry in the US could take years, though, and opens other concerns.\n\nThe rollout could impact trade and even make it harder to determine which birds have been infected, experts fear.\n\nThe USDA did not disclose details about the shots it would use in testing, though there are a few in development.\n\nAt the Pirbright Institute in the UK, scientists are developing an improved shot that involves tagging flu virus proteins with a marker that makes them easier for antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to capture.\n\nThis generates faster and stronger immune responses to the bird flu strain compared to the inactivated virus vaccine that is the current standard.\n\nScientists at the University of Wisconsin\u2019s School of Veterinary Medicine are working on an avian flu vaccine that uses tiny particles even smaller than the width of a human hair to deliver immunity by sending pathogen-like signals to cells.\n\nIf an updated shot proves effective, that would open the door to USDA approval followed by a thorough vaccination campaign that seeks to reach the affected commercial poultry industry.\n\nWhile shots for the purpose of fending off avian flu have been used in the past, the USDA has not approved one for what is considered \u2018highly pathogenic\u2019 avian influenza.\n\nThe avian flu of the \u2018low pathogenicity\u2019 category is not uncommon in wild birds and typically causes few or no signs of infection.\n\nThere is already an existing shot for fowlpox, a viral infection that leads to lesions on the skin of birds, that many domesticated fowl already receive.\n\nInfluenza vaccines are also already given to birds in China, Egypt, Mongolia and Vietnam \u2013 areas where strains of the virus are endemic in the poultry population.\n\nBut, it is unclear whether those shots would be effective against the circulation H5N1 strain.\n\nEven if it is, vaccinating domesticated birds in the US is an endeavor that could take years. Nearly 10billion chickens are produced in America each year just for meat.\n\nThis figure does not include turkeys and other domesticate birds and chickens produced for other purposes.\n\nDr Carol Cardona, an expert on avian health at the University of Minnesota, told the Times that single facilities with upwards of 5million birds would need over two years to get the job done.\n\nSome industry leaders also oppose a vaccine rollout for the birds.\n\nWhile it may save the lives of some animals, it opens the door to potential problems too.\n\nIf the vaccine only prevents birds from experiencing infection symptoms but not transmission of the virus itself, it could become even harder for farmers to identify affected flocks.\n\nThis allows the virus to spread even more, now undetected by humans, and cause more harm to both the poultry population but also increase the likelihood the virus jumps to humans.\n\nThe vaccine rollout also opens to door to restrictions on the import and export of birds based on their jab status.\n\n\u2018Although initially appealing as a simple solution to a widespread and troublesome problem, vaccination is neither a solution nor simple,\u2019 said Tom Super, a spokesperson for the National Chicken Council, told the Times.\n\nWhile controlling chicken and egg prices is important to officials, their main concern is the fear the virus will jump to humans.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency still deems the risk of bird flu to humans as low. \u2018But we cannot assume that will remain the case, and we must prepare for any change in the status quo,\u2019 he said earlier this month.\n\nLess than 900 cases have ever been recorded of the H5N1 virus in humans and almost all have been a result of animal-to-human transmission.\n\nThis occurs when the virus, usually from bird droppings, saliva or another fluid, gets into a person\u2019s mouth, nose, eyes or an open wound.\n\nIn rare cases, like during a small Hong Kong outbreak in 1997, the virus has spread from person-to-person.\n\nWhile the virus is believed to be constantly circulating among wild birds, the massive swell of cases among domesticated birds has alarmed experts.\n\nBecause domesticated birds often interact with humans, the risks of a spillover event are greatly increased.\n\nExperts warn that the virus is adapting in ways that allow it to cause outbreaks in other mammals \u2013 increasing the risk it could spread among people.\n\nIn October, an outbreak of the bird flu ravaged a population of 52,000 mink at a farm in Spain.\n\nSome of the critters were initially infected by eating meat from birds that died while infected.\n\nThere were also signs of mink-to-mink spread of the flu, which is unusual for a mammal population and signals a change to the virus.\n\nIn Peru, 716 sea lions were found to have died from the bird flu in recent weeks. Local officials worry that the virus has also spread between the animals \u2013 which are also mammals.\n\nThere are no treatments designed specifically for humans infected with bird flu, let alone H5N1. Those who fall ill are treated with regular antiviral drugs such as Zanamivir and Peramivir.\n\nIn case of an outbreak, the US does have a stockpile of vaccines designed to prevent infection from H5N1.\n\nIt is sold under the name Audenz and was approved in 2021 by the Food and Drug Administration for people six months and older. It is a two-dose vaccine.\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\u2022 Biden Says Transgender People Are Made In The Image Of God, Deserve Respect & Support\n\nDid you like this information?
