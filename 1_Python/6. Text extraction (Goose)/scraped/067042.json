Mary Baker G. Eddy appeared in The Boston Herald on the 17th inst.\n\nTo the Editor of The Herald.\n\nOn the subject of reporting contagion I have this to say: I have always believed that Christian Scientists should be law abiding; and, actuated by this conviction, I authorized the following statement, which appeared in The Boston Herald about one year ago:\u2014\n\n\"Rather than quarrel over vaccination, I recommend that if the law demand an individual to submit to this process, he obey the law; and then appeal to the gospel to save him from any bad results. Whatever changes belong to this century, or any epoch, we may safely submit to the providence of God, to common justice, individual rights and governmental usages.\"\n\nThis statement should be so interpreted as to apply, on the basis of Christian Science, to the reporting of contagion to the proper authorities when the law so requires. When Jesus was questioned about obeying the human law, he declared: \"Render unto C\u00e6sar the things that are C\u00e6sar's,\" even while you \"render unto God the things that are God's.\"", "opengraph": {"image": "https://sentinel.christianscience.com/bundles/mugosentineldigital/images/sentinel_share_logo.png", "title": "Obey the Law / Christian Science Sentinel", "site_name": "Christian Science Sentinel", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 1901", "article:modified_time": "Tue Apr 24 17:11:48 2012", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/JSH-Online/298116873586922", "url": "https://sentinel.christianscience.com/shared/view/owi2azw7uk?s=e", "description": "The\n following from the pen of Rev.
