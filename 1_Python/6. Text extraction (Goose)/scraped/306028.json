Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, on what unvaccinated students could expect when public school started on Monday.\n\n\u201cThey can go to school on Monday,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut they need to get their vaccinations \u2026 and their families will be alerted as to the dates.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal then asked whether unvaccinated children would have the option to learn virtually if they didn\u2019t get vaccinated. As of Thursday, students were told they had 20 days from the start of school to show proof of vaccination.\n\nBowser replied, \u201cWe\u2019re not offering remote learning for children, and families will need to comply with what is necessary to come to school.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal\u2019s article was shared widely on Twitter, including by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.\n\nThe D.C. government\u2019s vaccine numbers website shows 47% of the black children in the District ages 12-15 had not completed their primary vaccination series necessary to go back to school in person.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of D.C.
