And this includes both mainstream and \u201calt\u201d media.\n\nOn the rare occasion an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d was given any kind of platform, it was usually either a hand-picked kook, or a minor celebrity making arguments from emotion.\n\nThe actual science \u2013 and the professionals communicating that science \u2013 were banished from the mainstream airwaves. Airbrushed out of sight and mind.\n\nThe vaccines were branded \u201csafe and effective\u201d, by everyone everywhere.\n\nLast week the UK\u2019s BBC News invited Dr Aseem Malhotra to discuss prescriptions for statins to prevent heart disease (yeah \u2013 another issue, for another time).\n\nDuring his seven-minute interview, he linked mRNA covid \u201cvaccines\u201d to potential cardiac disease:\n\nThis, as far as I know, marks the first time a medical professional has been allowed to make these facts known in the mainstream media.\n\nBut why did it happen?\n\nAnd why did it happen now?\n\nThe \u201cofficial\u201d story is it was an oopsy moment. That somehow Dr Malhotra just \u201cslipped through the net\u201d, had been invited on to discuss statins, not Covid and just cleverly flipped the script and used his temporary platform to broadcast the truth.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this idea and see what we have.\n\nFirst thing to note is Dr Malhotra is by no means a closet vaccine-sceptic.\n\nHe has a Twitter account with substantial numbers of followers, on which he regularly questions the mRNA vaccines.\n\nHe has appeared on GB News questioning the vaccines multiple times.\n\nIt seems vanishingly unlikely any BBC researcher would fail to discover what his opinions of the vaccine were.\n\nAnd even supposing he did \u201cslip through the net\u201d, once he started talking about the vaccines, why did the anchor let him continue?\n\nWe have seen in the past how mainstream outlets treat people who start saying things they shouldn\u2019t say:\n\nHe\u2019s going off-topic, and as an interviewer, she would have every right to nudge him back toward the question. But if you watch the interview she barely even attempts to do this. In fact rather than changing the subject, blasting him for being an \u201canti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist\u201d, or simply cutting the feed\u2026the anchor actively pursues the subject, asking him further questions to draw him out.\n\nWhy would she do this if he was \u201cslipping through the net\u201d?\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: the very same day this \u201caccident\u201d happened Reuters reported the US CDC and FDA are investigating a possible link between Pfizer shots and strokes, under the headline:\n\nThis really should put the final nail in the coffin of the \u201caccident\u201d argument for anyone who understands how narrative-creation works.\n\nWhat we can deduce from this is there is a deliberate ongoing move to shift the narrative and allow some partial, limited discussion of vaccine harms.\n\nThe pressing question is why.\n\nI trust anyone reading this is well aware we can rule out any idea that the BBC, CDC et al have suddenly realized they made a huge mistake.\n\nThe entirety of the global establishment hasn\u2019t been ignoring the risks of the vaccines because they didn\u2019t understand, ok. It wasn\u2019t one big supranational brain fart.\n\nThey were lying, actively and deliberately, for years.\n\nIt\u2019s just that for some reason they have stopped, very briefly and in the tiniest way possible.\n\nSecondly, however reassuring it might be to think so, they have not been forced to admit the truth by sheer weight of evidence.\n\nThat\u2019s not how the psychopathic world of politics and narrative-creation works. There\u2019s nothing so true the agenda-setters and their tame media are forced to report it. On the contrary, they routinely deny the undeniably obvious every day, for year after year, for as long as they need or want to.\n\nThe truth has no relevance in their lexicon unless it also serves some other purpose. They tell stories of convenience, they report only what is of service to those stories.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget \u2013 they haven\u2019t admitted the truth.\n\nThey haven\u2019t even begun to do that and almost certainly never will.\n\nThey\u2019ve just stopped actively suppressing one part of the suppressed reality.\n\nHowever, even that tiny nano-grain of honesty potentially poses a direct threat to the mainstream narrative, in the way a single pebble rolling down a hill can potentially kick off a landslide \u2013 and they clearly know this because they immediately surrounded their \u201cadmission\u201d with walkbacks and caveats \u2013 just in case.\n\nWithin a few hours of Dr Malhotra\u2019s appearance on the news, the BBC had invited \u201csenior doctors\u201d on to counter his claims, and the Guardian was running a piece quoting various \u201coutraged\u201d doctors criticising the BBC for even letting him on.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the CDC/FDA admitted they were reviewing the vaccine\u2019s possible link to strokes\u2026they reported their results and announced they hadn\u2019t found anything.\n\nThe entire exercise was clearly carefully controlled. The smallest possible shift in the narrative, under very strict conditions.\n\nAfter all, the lethal dose of truth is surprisingly small.\n\nSo back to our initial question: Why this? Why now?\n\nWhy do it at all? Why put two years of \u201csafe and effective\u201d brainwashing at risk? What is going on behind the scenes here?\n\nWell, here are a few possible explanations:\n\u2022 Power struggle \u2013 Internal political struggle between the Great Reset supporters and those more traditional political factions who want to discredit the \u201cnew normal\u201d.\n\u2022 \u201cVaccine wars\u201d \u2013 Big pharma infighting, nothing but corporate greed winning out over narrative cohesion (they all pointedly question only the mRNA vaccines at this point, after all).\n\u2022 More fear \u2013 If the aim of the game is to scare people, then telling the 4 billion vaccinated individuals you might have poisoned them is a powerful move.\n\u2022 \u201cnew and improved vaccines\u201d \u2013 Maybe a push to corral the unvaccinated by \u201cadmitting\u201d a (tiny) problem, then \u201cfixing it\u201d in the next updated booster.\n\nWe can\u2019t completely rule out sabotage, of course. It\u2019s possible that some people within the establishment harbour genuine doubts about the course of events since 2020 and are trying to covertly get information out. Although the coordinated nature of the release makes that unlikely, it\u2019s not impossible.\n\nRegardless, we still need to keep our eyes open. It might be a victory, but it might be something else.\n\nThe old mantra applies: Always be sceptical of the media, even when \u2013 especially when \u2013 they tell you what you want to hear.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Why are they FINALLY \u201cadmitting\u201d the Covid Vax could be harmful?", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2023/01/19/why-are-they-finally-admitting-the-covid-vax-could-be-harmful/", "description": "Kit Knightly The mainstream narrative spinners \u2013 from politicians to the CDC to the media \u2013 have started reporting \u201cpossible harms\u201d due to Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d.
