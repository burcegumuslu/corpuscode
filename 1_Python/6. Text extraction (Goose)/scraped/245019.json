WHO is monitoring the new subvariant of omicron that has been detected in over 20 countries\u2014including the U.S.\u2014and is contributing to a recent surge of COVID-19 cases in India.\n\nWhile cases of this new variant are still low in the U.S., the rapid spread of new infections in India, as well as in some other countries, sparks some curiosity into how XBB.1.16, or Arcturus, is different from the long line of existing Omicron subvariants.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the deal with XBB.1.16 and how can it potentially impact your risk of contracting COVID-19? Experts explain what you need to know to stay safe.\n\nWhat is the Arcturus variant, or XBB.1.16?\n\nThe Arcturus variant, or the XBB.1.16, is a subvariant of Omicron and part of the new class of . It\u2019s spreading fast in India, but in the other countries, it hasn\u2019t taken off in the same way, explains , an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nAccording to , XBB.1.16 is a recombinant of BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75 and shares a mutation with . The mutations of this new variant have been associated with signs of increased transmissibility and a higher degree of infection. As of 27 March, XBB.1.16 sequences have been reported from 21 countries. However, so far reports do not indicate a rise in hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths due to XBB.1.16.\n\nIt does appear, because of its mutation in the spike protein, that the Arcturus variant is more infectious and so that accounts for some of its spread in India, says Dr. Schaffner. However, \u201cIt does not appear to produce more severe disease, so for the moment it is a variant of interest and not a variant of concern,\u201d he explains.\n\nThis variant is also likely more able to avoid prior from a previous infection, (again, since it shows a mutation in the spike protein) rendering it more contagious than prior variants, notes , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nHow can I distinguish Arcturus from other variants?\n\nThere is some data that is coming out that suggests that perhaps the spectrum of its symptoms may have some distinctive components, says Dr. Schaffner. XBB.1.16 \u201clikes to produce more high fever, which is not always very prominent in COVID.\u201d He adds that this variant also produces the usual kind of cough seen with previous COVID-19 variants.\n\nBut particularly in children, there seems to be a tell-tale symptom of this variant that hasn\u2019t surfaced in its predecessors. \u201cIt seems to be producing more conjunctivitis, and inflammation of the insides of the eyelids, which can be very itchy and make the eye look red,\u201d explains Dr. Schaffner.\n\nApart from some anecdotal reports of conjunctivitis and pink eye associated with Arcturus, this variant still presents very similarly to other Omicron variants, notes Dr. Adalja.\n\nAs mentioned above, there does seem to be a higher trend of the below XBB.1.16, or Arcturus, symptoms:\n\u2022 Some cases of conjunctivitis, particularly in children\n\nHowever, for the most part, the symptoms of COVID-19 that you are familiar with are also symptoms of this Arcturus variant.\n\nAccording to the (CDC), the most common symptoms of COVID-19, are still:\n\u2022 New loss of taste or smell\n\nIs there a vaccine for Arcturus?\n\nWhether you\u2019re eligible for another booster yet or not, it\u2019s common to question if the will defend against new variants. As it stands, it\u2019s still too early to know just how protective the current vaccine formulations will be against XBB.1.16.\n\nResearchers are currently making some distinctions between what\u2019s in the vaccine and this variant, but that doesn\u2019t always translate directly into protection, explains Dr. Schaffner. Still, getting your COVID-19 vaccine can decrease your risk for any severe infection. \u201cThe vaccine so far, in all of these other Omicron subvariants, has continued to provide pretty solid protection against severe disease,\u201d says Dr. Schaffner.\n\nAs far as treating infections, the treatments that we have right now, such as , should work just fine with this new subvariant, says Dr. Schaffner.\n\nDoes Arcturus increase my risk for long COVID?\n\nIt\u2019s much too early to say if this variant is more or less likely to lead to , says Dr. Schaffner.\n\nThat said, Omicron variants tend to cause less cases of long COVID, especially in vaccinated populations, notes Dr. Adalja. Also, repeat infections\u2014and most people have had at least one infection by now\u2014are less likely to cause long COVID as well, he adds.\n\nKeeping track of all of the different subvariants these days can be overwhelming and at times, confusing. Dr. Adalja reminds us that these subvariants \u201care all versions of Omicron and don\u2019t have the ability to heighten the risk of severe disease,\u201d so there\u2019s no need to worry too much over another subvariant yet.\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
