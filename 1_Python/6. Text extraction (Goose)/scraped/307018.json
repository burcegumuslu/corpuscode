On November 30, the designated new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called for a general vaccination requirement to be introduced in Germany by the beginning of March at the latest. Current Chancellor Angela Merkel announced her support for the mandate. The incoming German government has also announced a new covid-19 crisis staff, led by a general rather than a civilian. People opposing the vaccines are being monitored by Germany\u2019s secret service, and security authorities are warning of further radicalization.\n\nOn December 2, the German government and individual states announced lockdowns for the unvaccinated, excluding them from almost all public life. There are various lighter restrictions for the vaccinated and a mask mandate for schools. A decision about the impending vaccine mandate reportedly will come in February. Bavarian State Premier Markus S\u00f6der even demanded that the vaccine mandate include children as young as 12. When chairman of the Standing Commission on Vaccination in Germany, Thomas Mertens, said that he would not want his own 7-year-old child vaccinated because of the lack of data, he was criticized by politicians.\n\nHow can you escape the claws of the government?\n\nSome people are frightened by the rhetoric and stricter measures. It even appears some media outlets are trying to reassure people it\u2019s not that bad. In \u201cCompulsory Vaccination Does Not Mean Forced Vaccination,\u201d n-tv.de explained: \u201cWhen people talk about compulsory vaccination, they quickly imagine two policemen holding an unwilling person and then a doctor in a white coat coming and giving the injection. But that\u2019s not exactly what would happen.\u201d Those unwilling to comply would just be given a fine or a prison sentence.\n\nThose who oppose the government\u2019s measures are placed under surveillance. Spiegel Online noted on November 29: \u201cIn two days, the interior ministers of the federal states will meet to discuss the security situation in Germany. Calls are now being made in advance for stronger surveillance of right-wing extremists and covid deniers in particular. Saxony\u2019s security authorities, among others, are registering an increasing radicalization of \u2018lateral thinkers\u2019 and other opponents of the coronavirus protection measures.\u201d\n\nTo help with the logistics of vaccinating millions of people and giving them booster shots every three months, the newly designated government chose Maj. Gen. Carsten Breuer of the German Armed Forces. According to insiders, Breuer\u2019s responsibility will be to \u201cvaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate,\u201d Spiegel Online noted.\n\nA general with experience from operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan and from the preparation of the Defender Europe major maneuvers will \u2026 lead the coronavirus crisis team of the red-green-yellow federal government. Since last year, Maj. Gen. Carsten Breuer, as commander of the Territorial Tasks Command, has organized the Bundeswehr\u2019s administrative assistance in the fight against the covid-19 pandemic. \u2026 He will operate the new coronavirus crisis team, a civil body, from an office in the federal chancellery. By assigning posts to a general, the new government, in which the Greens have a strong position, is pushing the normalization of the military forward in society.\n\nWhile trying to protect citizens, leaders are ignoring other, more serious health crises. Bayerischer Rundfunk noted that in Bavaria, child psychiatric agencies are running out of room for patients, as the number of suicidal teenagers increases. \u201cDepression, suicidal thoughts and family quarrels: Children suffer massively from the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Bild wrote. \u201cSchoolchildren send mass alarm calls in social networks, fearful of the return to lockdowns. \u2018The number of calls for help has risen massively, in some cases by 70 percent,\u2019 Kai Lanz, founder and ceo of krisenchat.de warned. \u2018In October and November alone, we got 150 requests a day.\u2019\u201d Yet you hear almost nothing about this crisis.\n\nEuropeans today are enduring a depressing reality as millions fear losing their jobs, child depression increases, and protesters are surveilled by the state. Submitting to the jab won\u2019t give you true freedom. The government will just find new ways to force its citizens to submit.\n\nThis increasing authoritarian behavior in Europe is something we have been warning about for decades.\n\nHerbert W. Armstrong wrote in his booklet Who or What Is the Prophetic Beast? that Revelation 13 describes an authoritarian regime to rise in Europe that will persecute and kill anyone who opposes it. Many have ignored these prophecies, yet we see them coming to pass in Europe today! What can you do to escape the growing authoritarian regime?\n\nThe Bible gives the answer.\n\n\u201cGreat peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them\u201d (Psalm 119:165). This is an absolute promise. God gives peace to those who obey Him. Obedience requires faith, but it is the only way to bring true peace.
