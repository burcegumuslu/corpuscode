And 900,000 euros in E.U. funds were spent on the development of software modules for Ecuadorian election authorities.\n\nThis is highly relevant because it shows that Scytl is hardly a trustworthy company, especially when it comes to something as sensitive as a national election \u2013 and especially a national election with as much on the line as this one.\n\nWith that said, Scytl\u2019s potential role in flipping votes for Biden cannot be overstated, as this would have been the company to do it in a number of key swing states.\n\nWhile there are several other companies also involved, including Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, Scytl is another name worth emblazoning in your mind as a potential culprit.\n\nFederal Elections Commission (FEC) head Trey Trainor has already stated that he believes election fraud was so widespread this cycle that the results are \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\n\nLike the rest of us, Great Game India really wants to know why a shady company like Scytl \u2013 and a bankrupt one at that \u2013 was ever allowed to be involved in America\u2019s election process. Will Americans ever receive the answers they deserve?\n\n\u201cThe current Spanish government wants to overthrow Trump,\u201d wrote one Great Game India commenter, revealing one possibility as to the how and why behind this bizarre partnership. \u201cThey have expressed this desire more than once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey serve Soros,\u201d this same commenter added, referring to the infamous globalist infiltrator George Soros. \u201cThe first meeting the president had was with Soros. They are open communists, and they are proud of being communists \u2026 The communists are destroying democracy in Europe and America. We are all heading to 1984.\u201d\n\nAs more news comes to light about the contested 2020 election, we will report on it at Trump.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Bankrupt Spanish company Scytl helped rig Biden\u2019s election \u201cwin\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2020-11-19-bankrupt-spanish-company-scytl-rigged-election-biden.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "The United States military reportedly conducted a raid the other day on a facility in Germany that housed servers run by Scytl, a Spanish election technology company that is now being accused of helping to rig the American election for Joe Biden.
