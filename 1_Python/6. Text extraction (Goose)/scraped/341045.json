Some of them said too little. Some said nothing at all.\n\nEven though they knew what we didn't.\n\nOur blood is now on their hands.\n\nThose are strong words. But the unvaccinated had access to important information about the potential side effects of vaccines. They knew about the risks of severe allergic reactions, blood clots, and other serious health complications. They knew that vaccines did not immunize us. They knew it wasn't effective, and that they can cause more harm than good.\n\nThey knew all of that, but instead of warning us, the unvaccinated chose to remain silent. They chose to look the other way and not speak out about the potential dangers of vaccines. They let millions of good folks who did the right thing (at the time) fall to death and disease, and many antivaxxers even gloated online about how their coin flip had been the right bet. The more diabolical even urged folks they disagree with to \"get boosted\".\n\nIt has become all too clear. The silence of the unvaccinated was a dangerous, sociopathic, and irresponsible decision that has had serious consequences for those of us who received the vaccinations.\n\nAnd silence is, after all, consent.\n\nIt is time for the unvaccinated to take responsibility for their actions and to work with the rest of us to find a solution to this crisis. We cannot afford to let their selfishness and lack of action continue to harm our communities. It is time for the unvaccinated to step up and do the right thing.\n\nThe unvaccinated should by any moral measuring stick have done more to warn about the potential risks -- to help us make informed decisions about our health. And they must now ask us for our forgiveness.\n\nAnd, hand to heart, we may just give it to them. Because we are good people.\n\nWe took those injections because it was the right thing to do -- until it wasn't.\n\nLate last evening, you should know, it was reported: \u201cAn FDA expert panel on Thursday unanimously recommended that the U.S. overhaul its pandemic vaccine strategy and replace initial doses of original COVID shots with bivalent ones that target specific Omicron subvariants\u201d\u2014which was interesting because this report followed the Project Veritas organization releasing its beyond shocking video \u201cPfizer Executive: \u2018Mutate\u2019 COVID via \u2018Directed Evolution\u2019 for Company to Continue Profiting Off of Vaccines \u2026 \u2018COVID is Going to be a Cash Cow for Us\u2019 \u2026 \u2018That is Not What We Say to the Public\u2019 \u2026 \u2018People Won\u2019t Like That\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Don\u2019t Tell Anyone\u2019\u201d, that made breaking news all over the world, except in the United States.\n\nYou should also know that on 2 June 2021, the peer-reviewed scientific study \u201cThe Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations\u2014We Should Rethink the Policy\u201d was published, wherein it revealed: \u201cFor three deaths prevented by COVID-19 vaccination, we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination\u201d\u2014this past week pediatric cardiologist Dr. Michael Ackerman at the Mayo Clinic revealed: \u201cOne in 5,000 is the reasonable number of young male ages 15\u201325-year-old male getting vaccine-associated myocarditis from one of the mRNA- derived vaccines\u201d\u2014a revelation joined by American multi-billionaire Elon Musk posting the message: \u201cI had major side effects from my second booster shot...Felt like I was dying for several days...Hopefully, no permanent damage, but I dunno...And my cousin, who is young & in peak health, had a serious case of myocarditis\u2026Had to go to the hospital\u201d\u2014and as of 13 January 2023, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in the United States reported that Covid vaccinations have caused 33,746 deaths and 189,384 hospitalizations, as well as 18,261 heart attacks, 26.221 myocarditis events, 4,886 miscarriages and have left 62,253 Americans permanently disabled.\n\nOn 18 November 2022, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in the United States stopped putting free text field information in the public data for Europe and the United Kingdom, which made it no surprise when it was reported this week: \u201cTroubled by national statistics showing 20% excess deaths per week, United Kingdom MPs have demanded an investigation\u201d\u2014a report joined by famed American podcaster Dan Bongino of Fox News warning not to pay attention to the Biden classified document stories because they are being used as misdirection to cover-up everything about the Covid scamdemic\u2014and was a warning followed by the article \u201cAfrica Is Starkly Unvaccinated, And Starkly Unvanquished By COVID\u201d, wherein it revealed:\n\nPart of the African continent\u2019s success is no doubt due to a fortunate accident of microbiology, infectious diseases, pharmacology and immunology.\n\nIt so happens that two of the most effective treatments for COVID, Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, are also routine prophylactic weekly medicines throughout equatorial Africa, because they happen to be known for a half-century as the most effective, applicable and safest anti-parasite medications.\n\nSo the population, particularly through about 31 countries, the tropical middle rectangle roughly, of already were well-equipped prior to COVID events launching in late 2019 to early 2020.\n\nAs fortune would have it, the unpatented and relatively inexpensive half-century old drug Ivermectin, whose inventors won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2015, also has been the most effective medicine against COVID, due in part to its specific effect against RNA transcriptase, as well as its blocking effect on all three parts of the trimeric spike protein, and other mechanisms.\n\nHydroxychloroquine is also used widely throughout at least equatorial regions of Africa as a prophylactic against parasites, but which fortunately has now been studied extensively and used successfully as both prevention and treatment of COVID disease, and as inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and activity. This is shown in over 380 studies conducted in 55 countries.\n\nAs all of you know, most certainly not \u201chaving blood on their hands\u201d for failing to warn everyone about the Covid scamdemic are the Dear Sisters, who fearlessly and tirelessly told the truth about Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin while warning about the grave dangers of experimental and untested mRNA vaccines.\n\nAs all of you also know, for telling the truth the Dear Sisters, and those few others like them, have been relentlessly attacked, banned and censored to the point of near extinction, and whose only hope for survival against this unrelenting onslaught is YOU.\n\nSo, and if the truth means anything at all to you, is it really too much to ask that you go below and aid the Dear Sisters so they can keep their mission of truth ongoing?\n\nOr, you can live in the socialist world predicted by George Orwell, that after all truthful sources of information has been extinguished, you awaken to the fact: \u201cHe felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster...He was alone...The past was dead, the future was unimaginable\u201d.\n\nThank you for listening and aiding us in our hour of desperate need by going below and giving what you can, and as always, please feel free to write me at [email protected] with any comments/questions/suggestions, remembering to put ATTN: BRIAN in the subject line, or if requesting to be placed on the Sisters mailing list, put MAILING LIST in the subject line.\n\nAll the best folks,", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C41GCgyG4mI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/C41GCgyG4mI"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/btsAWkcl-oA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/btsAWkcl-oA"}], "links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=December%2031%2C%202019,fever%20occurring%20in%20Wuhan%2C%20China.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C41GCgyG4mI", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C41GCgyG4mI", "https://iqfy.com/unvaccinated-silence/", "https://www.axios.com/2023/01/26/fda-panel-annual-covid-vaccine", "https://www.projectveritas.com/", "https://www.projectveritas.com/news/pfizer-executive-mutate-covid-via-directed-evolution-for-company-to-continue/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btsAWkcl-oA", "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm", "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm", "https://www.ksla.com/2023/01/24/mayo-clinic-physician-weighs-covid-19-vaccine-sudden-cardiac-death/", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1616697612043972610", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://www.rt.com/news/570436-uk-excess-deaths-investigation-mps/", "https://rumble.com/v26sk4o-the-vaccine-culture-war-is-shifting-ep.-1934-the-dan-bongino-show.html", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/africa-starkly-unvaccinated-and-starkly-unvanquished-covid", "https://bookroo.com/quotes/george-orwell", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dcafb3aebfb4bdbabdbdb09cbabdafa8b1bdb5b0f2bab1", "https://fundrazr.com/f1fYo3?ref=sh_79C0K1_ab_1Kr7htbtQ5H1Kr7htbtQ5H", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
