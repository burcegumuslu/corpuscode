Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.\n\nThe legal case brought by a whistleblower from Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine trial has been dismissed by a judge.\n\nBrook Jackson, who worked for Pfizer contractor Ventavia Research Group, didn\u2019t prove violations of the False Claims Act, U.S. District Judge Michael Truncale ruled on March 31.\n\nJackson sued Ventavia, Pfizer, and another organization involved in the vaccine trial in 2021, alleging that trial violations she uncovered meant that the government was defrauded when it paid for doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nInternal records show Ventavia officials acknowledging that patients were unblinded, adverse events weren\u2019t recorded, and vaccine doses were kept unlocked in \u201cdisorganized\u201d rooms. Under the False Claims Act, the government or a party suing on the government\u2019s behalf\u2014Jackson in this case\u2014can recover money for false claims made by parties to secure payment for the government. Parties are liable if they knowingly present a false claim for payment or intentionally use a false record or statement material to make a false claim. While Jackson presented evidence that violations occurred, the government\u2019s prototype agreement with Pfizer only conditioned payment on delivery of a vaccine that had been authorized or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Truncale ruled. The payment section states that \u201cthe Government will have no right to withhold payment in respect of any delivered doses, unless the FDA has withdrawn approval or authorization of the vaccine.\u201d The FDA, which Jackson alerted to the violations, hasn\u2019t withdrawn approval or authorization. \u201cIn sum, Ms. Jackson has failed to plead that the Government conditioned payment on Defendants\u2019 certification of compliance with regulatory provisions or clinical trial protocol,\u201d Truncale said in the new ruling. While Jackson argued that the false record portion of the False Claims Act (FCA) was violated because of the trial violations, the defendants said false records and statements alone didn\u2019t create liability without a false claim seeking payment from the government. \u201cThe upshot is that there is no liability under the FCA for making or using a false record or statement where the claimant is entitled to the payment,\u201d Truncale said. \u201cPfizer was entitled to its claims for payment. Therefore, Ms. Jackson has not stated a claim for false record liability.\u201d The judge quoted a different ruling, which found that the False Claims Act was enacted by Congress \u201cto vindicate fraud on the federal government, not second guess decisions made by those empowered through the democratic process to shape public policy.\u201d \u201cWhen the government, at appropriate levels, repeatedly concludes that it has not been defrauded, it is not forgiving a found fraud\u2014rather, it is concluding that there was no fraud at all,\u201d the ruling reads. Attorneys for Pfizer offered that argument during a recent hearing in the case. \u201cSo if the FDA gets it wrong, they just get it wrong, and we live with it?\u201d Truncale asked. \u201cThe Government has been aware of Ms. Jackson\u2019s allegations for several years, has granted Emergency Authorization multiple times, and to this day continues to authorize and provide Pfizer\u2019s vaccine at no cost,\u201d the judge said in the new ruling. He acknowledged the evidence that Jackson offered but said her complaint didn\u2019t \u201cidentify any safety risk that was hidden from the FDA in the data from the Ventavia sites, any symptomatic participants who Ventavia did not properly test for COVID-19 infection, or any COVID-19 infections in vaccinated participants that Ventavia falsely reported to have occurred in the placebo group.\u201d Jackson was hired in September 2020. She reported problems with the trial to Ventavia management shortly after starting at the company. Dissatisfied with the response, she went to the FDA on Sept. 25, 2020. Ventavia fired Jackson that same day. The False Claims Act protects whistleblowers from harassment, retaliation, and threats. The person must be engaged in protected activity, defined in a previous ruling as \u201cmotivated by a concern regarding fraud against the government.\u201d The employer must also know the person was engaged in protected activity, and the punitive action or actions must be because of the activity. Jackson\u2019s activity doesn\u2019t meet the standard because she hasn\u2019t alleged that she was concerned about potential fraud against the government, according to Truncale. \u201cRather, she alleges that she complained about participant safety and regulatory, protocol, and HIPAA violations,\u201d he said, referring to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \u201cBut that is not protected activity under the FCA\u2019s retaliation provision\u2014internal complaints about patient safety, or protocol and regulatory violations, are not the same thing as complaining about defrauding the Government.\u201d Even if Jackson was engaged in protected activity, the judge said Jackson didn\u2019t show that Ventavia knew she was involved in such activity. Truncale dismissed the False Claims Act claims with prejudice, which means they can\u2019t be brought again. The retaliation claim was dismissed without prejudice. Pfizer, Ventavia, and the third defendant, ICON, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Warner Mendenhall, a lawyer representing Jackson, said an appeal is forthcoming. \u201cThe dismissal of Pfizer\u2019s case is a despicable & heinous betrayal of justice, a slap in the face to vaccine injured and whistleblowers, a blatant example of corruption, incompetence and cowardice, a declaration that the powerful are above the law,\u201d Jackson said in a statement. \u201cI will never back down, no matter what it costs.\u201d Note to readers: Please click the share button above.
