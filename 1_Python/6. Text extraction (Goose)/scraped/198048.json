The French Shot That\u2019s Supposed To Be \u2018Variant Proof\u2019", "cleaned_text": "A COVID-19 vaccine from French company Valneva has yet to complete clinical trials. But it has caught the eye of governments in the UK, Europe and Australia.\n\nOne of the vaccine\u2019s main selling points is its apparent ability to mount a more general immune response against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, rather than rely on the spike protein to do this.\n\nThis means the vaccine is more likely to be effective against the type of virus variants we\u2019ve already seen emerging and may emerge in the future. Some reports describe it as \u201cvariant proof\u201d.\n\nThe hope is vaccines using this technology would be able to provide protection for longer, rather than keep being reformulated to get ahead of these new variants.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nValneva\u2019s vaccine, called VLA2001, is based on tried and tested vaccine technology. It\u2019s the technology used in the vaccine against poliovirus and in some types of flu vaccines. And the company already has a commercially available Japanese encephalitis vaccine based on the same technology.\n\nVLA2001 uses an inactivated version of the whole virus, which cannot replicate or cause disease.\n\nThe virus is inactivated using a chemical called beta-propiolactone or BPL. This is widely used to inactivate other viruses for vaccines. It was even used to make experimental versions of vaccines against SARS-CoV, the virus that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).\n\nThis type of inactivation is expected to preserve the structure of the viral proteins, as they would occur in nature. This means the immune system will be presented with something similar to what occurs naturally, and mount a strong immune response.\n\nAfter being inactivated, the vaccine would be highly purified. Then, an adjuvant (an immune stimulant) is added to induce a strong immune response.\n\nVLA2001 isn\u2019t the first inactivated vaccine against COVID-19. Leading COVID-19 inactivated vaccines, such as those developed by Sinopharm and Bharat Biotech, have been approved for use in China and received emergency approval in other countries, including India.\n\nHowever, VLA2001 is the only COVID-19 vaccine candidate using whole inactivated virus in clinical trials in the UK and in mainland Europe.\n\nWhat are the benefits we know so far?\n\nThis approach to vaccine development presents the immune system with all of the structural components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not just the spike protein, as many other COVID-19 vaccines do.\n\nSo Valneva\u2019s vaccine is thought to produce a more broadly protective immune response. That is, antibodies and cells of the immune system are able to recognise and neutralise more pieces of the virus than just the spike protein.\n\nAs a result, Valneva\u2019s vaccine could be more effective at tackling emerging COVID-19 virus variants and, if approved, play a useful role as a booster vaccine.\n\nValneva\u2019s vaccine can be stored at standard cold-chain conditions (2-8\u2103) and is expected to be given as two shots.\n\nHow about results from clinical trials?\n\nAccording to the company, no safety concerns or serious adverse events were associated with VLA2001 in early-stage clinical trials.\n\nVLA2001 was given as a low, medium or high dose in these trials with all participants in the high-dose group generating antibodies to the virus spike protein.\n\nOne measure of immune response in the high-dose group after completing the two doses indicated antibody levels were, after two weeks, at least as high as those seen in patients naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nInterestingly, VLA2001 induced immune responses against a number of virus proteins (including the spike protein) across all participants, an encouraging sign the vaccine can provide broad protection against COVID-19.\n\nThe vaccine has since advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in the UK. The trial, which started in April 2021, will compare its safety and efficacy with the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThe phase 3 trial is expected to be completed by the northern hemisphere\u2019s autumn this year. And if successful, would be submitted for regulatory approval after that.\n\nDespite phase 3 clinical trials only just starting, the UK government has pre-ordered more than 100 million doses of the vaccine from Valneva, with the option of buying more down the track. If trials prove successful and pass regulatory approval, this means the vaccine could be used as a booster in time for this year\u2019s northern hemisphere\u2019s winter.\n\nAustralia has confirmed it\u2019s also in talks with Valeneva about importing the vaccine. Some countries in Europe are also reportedly keen to strike a deal.\n\nAs new cases of COVID-19 increase globally, we\u2019ll continue to see new viral variants emerge that threaten to escape the protection existing vaccines offer.\n\nAlready, we are seeing vaccines from companies such as Moderna and Novavax begin to reformulate their spike protein-based vaccines to get ahead of emerging variants.\n\nSo Valneva\u2019s vaccine, with the potential to elicit a more broadly protective immune response, may prove to be a useful tool to combat the rise of the virus and its mutations. However, whether the vaccine is really \u201cvariant proof\u201d or merely less affected by emerging variants remains to be seen.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
