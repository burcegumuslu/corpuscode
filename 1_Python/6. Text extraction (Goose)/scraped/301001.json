But it turns out people in several U.S. states have a lot more to worry about than some pesky itching.\n\nAccording to health officials, a rare virus called eastern equine encephalitis virus, or EEE, that can cause brain damage has been found in New York, Massachusetts, Florida, South Carolina, and New Jersey.\n\nThe virus, spread by infected mosquitoes, has been confirmed in mosquitoes south of Boston, MA; mosquito pools about 20 miles north of Syracuse, NY; in the blood of sentinel chickens in Orange County, FL; in an Appaloosa colt in Chesterfield County, SC; and a 12-year-old vaccinated mare in Ocean County, NJ that was euthanized on July 23.\n\nThankfully EEE is rare and no human infections have been reported this year, but it is known to wreak havoc on livestock and can cause personality changes in humans who aren\u2019t killed by the virus.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 5 to 10 humans cases are reported every year in the United States, but 30% of cases typically prove fatal and most survivors are left with permanent damage. In 90% of cases, EEE proves fatal for horses.\n\nAfter the virus is transmitted to humans via mosquito bite, the victim may suffer from encephalitis\u2014or inflammation of the brain\u2014ultimately leading to death or permanent brain damage. Other symptoms include headache, fever, chills and vomiting for four to 10 days after transmission. Severe symptoms include seizures, disorientation and coma.\n\nWhile there is no cure for EEE, a blood or spinal fluid test can diagnose the infection and, if it doesn\u2019t reach the brain, it\u2019s possible to recover within a matter of weeks.\n\nThe danger comes when the virus reaches the brain. When this occurs, irreversible problems such as confusion, memory loss, personality changes, paralysis and more are possible.\n\nThankfully, the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses can be significantly lessened through prevention. If you work or play frequently outdoors, experts recommend using bug spray that contains DEET or lemon eucalyptus, in addition to wearing long clothing that covers the skin. According to officials, people under the age of 15 or over 50 are at greatest risk for serious illness.\n\nReducing sources of standing water\u2014like flower puts, buckets, bird baths and other containers\u2014can help to reduce the mosquito population in your yard. It is also a good idea to make sure that all screens are in-tact so the pests don\u2019t enter your home.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mosquitoes-eee-virus.jpg", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2019/07/mosquitoes-eee-virus.html", "title": "A Rare Virus Spread by Mosquitoes Can Change Your Personality \u2014 and It's Just Been Found in 5 States", "description": "A virus that can cause brain damage has been found in New York, Massachusetts, Florida, South Carolina, and New Jersey.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/emma.fiala.7", "article:section": "News", "updated_time": "2019-07-28T22:21:38-05:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mosquitoes-eee-virus.jpg", "image:width": "740", "image:height": "410", "image:alt": "Mosquitoes EEE Virus", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2019-07-28T21:08:55-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-07-28T22:21:38-05:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://themindunleashed.com/", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/globelocal/2019/07/23/eee-virus-found-four-local-communities/ar5m7HLNvEZEcgfsXQA9bI/story.html", "https://www.syracuse.com/news/2019/07/mosquito-borne-eee-virus-found-in-oswego-county.html", "https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/28/health/eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-outbreak-chickens-florida-trnd/index.html?no-st=1564348276", "https://abcnews4.com/news/local/first-equine-encephalitis-case-of-2019-confirmed-in-sc", "https://equimanagement.com/news/first-2019-eee-case-in-new-jersey", "https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/index.html", "https://www.syracuse.com/news/2019/07/mosquito-borne-eee-virus-found-in-oswego-county.html", "https://themindunleashed.com/author/emmafiala", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://themindunleashed.com/2019/07/mosquitoes-eee-virus.html", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["Emma Fiala"], "publish_date": "2019-07-28T21:08:55-05:00"}
