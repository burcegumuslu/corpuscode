It\u2019s weird. I hope we don\u2019t find out that somehow this mrna lingers in the body, because it has to be affecting something hormonal to impact menstrual cycles. Yeah, or like the entire next generation is like [messed] up. Could you imagine the scandal? Oh \u2026 I would take Pfizer off my resume.\n\n \u2014Jordon Trishton Walker\n\nJewish rabbis in New York learned about this in November 2021 and almost unilaterally forbade the administration of the vaccine.\n\nThis new video exposes the following:\n\u2022 Pfizer is and has been aware of these problems for a while. \u201c[P]eople will have to investigate that down the line,\u201d Walker said.\n\u2022 According to Walker, Pfizer believes the vaccine is damaging some part of the \u201chypothalamus, pituitary, gonadal axis\u201d in order to be causing menstrual problems.\n\u2022 Pfizer is already moving on from 19 and wants to use m technology to develop gene-editing medicines.\n\nWalker made it clear that Pfizer is aware of just how big a scandal it has on its hands:\n\nI will say if it does come down the line there\u2019s something wrong with the vaccine, then obviously people will criticize the big push because there was a lot of social pressure, government pressure, job pressure to get the vaccine. I had to get the vaccine otherwise I would have gotten fired. If something were to happen downstream and it was really bad, the scale of that scandal would be enormous.\n\nPfizer executives don\u2019t care about people\u2019s health. They care about money. That\u2019s what we cover in our April 2022 Trumpet issue, \u201cRunning on COVID Money.\u201d The mainstream media refuses to report on the piles of evidence that the vaccine is dangerous. But we do.
