It was recorded during a protest against the overturn of the 1973 Roe v. Wade abortion ruling in Seattle.\n\n\u201c[The] desecration of another person\u2019s religious material is a hate crime. If this was a Quran, people would be outraged. People must really hate the Word of God right now,\u201d TSP captioned the video.\n\nLeftist protesters were captured in the act of repeatedly kicking the holy book \u2013 before TSP stepped in. He remarked amid cackling laughter: \u201cLook at this, disrespectful. This is a hate crime. You realize you guys are committing a hate crime right now?\u201d (Related: Leftists make good on \u201cnight of rage\u201d riot threats after Roe v. Wade gets overturned.)\n\nTSP later turned to the offenders, rebuking them: \u201cThis was a crime. You would not have done that if this was the Quran.\u201d One of the protesters then grabbed the damaged Bible, which he attempted to retrieve \u2013 but in vain.\n\nThe next section of the clip showed the desecrated Bible thrown in the bottom of a portable toilet, amid human waste.\n\n\u201cThat right there is a hate crime. That is ungodly and [that] is wrong,\u201d TSP lamented. He continued in a mournful voice: \u201cI can\u2019t believe these people. I can\u2019t believe they would do that.\u201d\n\nTSP\u2019s footage resulted in a firestorm of reactions from Christians on social media, who denounced the sacrilegious act in Seattle.\n\nProminent songwriter \u201cFive Times August\u201d called the deranged protesters \u201ctruly the cancer of [the] Earth.\u201d He added: \u201cEverything they pretend to be against is exactly who they are.\u201d\n\nChristian evangelist and former professional poker player Anna Khait expressed sadness toward the protesters who desecrated the Bible. \u201cOne day, their souls will understand how foolish and blind they are,\u201d she said.\n\nThe holy book of Christians was not the only target of pro-abortion ire after the Supreme Court reversed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. In a 5-4 vote, the high court returned the question of abortion\u2019s legality to the states on June 24. While some Republican states enacted bans on abortion, some Democratic states reiterated that they would be \u201csafe havens\u201d for abortion.\n\nFollowing the ruling, two Christian pregnancy centers in Colorado and Oregon fell victim to pro-abortion leftists.\n\nOn the early morning of June 25, police were called to the Life Choices pregnancy center in Longmont Colorado after it was set on fire. The perpetrators also vandalized the center with pro-abortion messages. The slogans sprayed on the walls of the facility included \u201cbans off our bodies\u201d and \u201cif abortions are safe, neither are you.\u201d\n\nThe building where Life Choices was located suffered \u201cheavy fire and smoke damage.\u201d The Longmont Police Department, meanwhile, said it is currently looking for the suspects behind the attack.\n\nThe Dove Medical Center in Eugene, Oregon also bore the brunt of attacks by pro-abortion protesters. A press release from the Eugene Police Department stated that more than 75 rioters gathered in front of the hospital as part of the \u201cNight of Rage\u201d protests against the Supreme Court decision.\n\nMany of the protesters were \u201cwearing all-black clothing with masks and hoods,\u201d with \u201csome people \u2026 picking up rocks\u201d and \u201c[donning] gas masks.\u201d It added that \u201cunknown people in the crowd threw smoke bombs at officers along with several filled water bottles.\u201d Ten individuals were arrested during the protests.\n\nAccording to LifeSiteNews, both Life Choices and Dove Medical Center promote themselves as faith-based pregnancy centers that explicitly state that they will not refer or direct women for abortions.\n\nWatch the footage from a pro-abortion protest in front of the Los Angeles County Courthouse below.\n\nThis video is from the Covid Times channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nTHIS IS TOLERANCE?
