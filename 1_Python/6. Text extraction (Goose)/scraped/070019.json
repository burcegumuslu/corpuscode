All its elements clearly point to an orchestrated intention; in other words, it cannot be an accident. And the intention we discern in the current historical moment, the underlying plan, would appear to lay the ground for what has been called a \u201c techno-totalitarian digital dark ageClub of RomeUnited NationsWorld Economic Forum , that is, what has come to be known as the Great Reset \u2014 the corporate takeover of property, health, currency, travel, energy, and sustenance. The upshot involves a thorough restructuring of democratic society along neo-medieval lines , an elimination of the middle class, a two-tier political order, and a reduction of the global census.\n\nThe sinister elements composing this storm are readily observable to anyone paying attention:\n\u2022 The imposition of a viral pandemic and its official response \u2014 lockdowns, social distancing, masks, quarantines, medical apartheid \u2014 that effectively closed down the public life and economic structures of entire nations, leading to loss of livelihoods, physical and psychological illness, and spiraling suicide rates.\n\u2022 The mandating of novel genomic \u201cvaccines\u201d that are creating mass casualties, as witnessed in the phenomenon of SADS \u2014 Sudden Adult Death Syndrome \u2014 which came into prominence post-vaccine. The plethora of dissuasive \u201cfact-checks\u201d on social media and the Internet are further signs that we are living in an age of censorship. The correlation between SADS and the vaccine rollout is overwhelming and may even suggest a causal link. The massive rise in stillbirths may also be attributed to the vaccines.\n\u2022 A \u201cclimate change\u201d policy entailing carbon taxes, bans on fertilizers, the shutting down of standard energy production, the marketing of costly and inefficient electric vehicles that threaten to deplete the power grid, and the legislating of largely unworkable and extortionate green renewables based on insecure and fabricated science and dodgy computer models, whose effect has been to impoverish both producers and ordinary citizens in bringing about a new and despotic dispensation.\n\u2022 Rampant inflation, pricing the necessities of life beyond the ability of vast numbers of people to afford them.\n\u2022 The official insistence on so-called \u201cabortion rights.\u201d\n\u2022 The focus on and pursuit of LGBTQ+, \u201cnon-binary,\u201d transgender, and sexual indoctrination of preschoolers and minors, creating a growing cohort of human beings who do not reproduce, i.e., a condition of sterility.\n\u2022 The proposed creation of a cashless digital economy and the introduction of digital ID with the aim of establishing a China-style social credit system, depriving the individual of personal freedom and discretionary choice.\n\u2022 The initiating of proxy wars, as in Ukraine, further resulting in crippling forms of material scarcity, economic pain, and population stress.\n\nAll these factors are occurring at the same time, that is, they are components of a perfect storm brought to bear on the global community \u2014 or, more accurately, on the community of Western nations. (\u201cCivilization states\u201d like Russia, China, and India, are largely immune to the concerted onslaught.)\n\nOne cannot credibly deny that there exists a conscious purpose behind so evident a concatenation of simultaneous events, envisaging a new and reductionist world order and population diminishment in every sense of the term. The liberal civilization of the West is to be replaced by an anti-capitalist global coup favoring a totalitarian governing class. Indeed, to change the metaphor, what is impending is a kind of \u201cmass extinction event\u201d on the level of culture, state, and civilization, a kind of ideological asteroid or \u201cplanet killer,\u201d orbiting very close to the future.\n\nIn his 2020 Ted Talk, Bill Gates asserts that \u201cif we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, and reproductive health services, we could lower [world population] by ten or fifteen percent.\u201d Vaccines and boosters seem to be having precisely that effect. Gates\u2019 posing with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian Marxist revolutionary, should tell us all we need to know. Klaus Schwab\u2019s Great Reset, backed by leading politicians, NGOs, technocrats, and globalist oligarchs, would reduce the free world geopolitically and demographically to near-global servitude.\n\nFor additional confirmation, one need only read the Meadows/Randers influential and updated book, Limits to Growth, adopted by the Club of Rome. As Dennis Meadows claims in a recent interview with the leftist online magazine Resilience, \u201cI don\u2019t know what a sustainable population level is now, but it\u2019s probably much closer to a billion people, or fewer.\u201d The authors are skeptical of growth as a function of what they call \u201covershoot,\u201d of \u201cgo[ing] beyond limits accidentally,\u201d which can ultimately produce an \u201cecological footprint\u201d that is unsustainable. They do not recognize that growth and its negative offshoots can be managed without employing drastic solutions \u2014 solutions that are themselves a product of overshoot. \u201cIf a profound correction is not made soon,\u201d they warn, \u201ca crash of some sort is certain.\u201d The trouble is, they are the crash.\n\nOf course, there is nothing new in their deposition. They advance what is essentially a Malthusian argument that posits an inverse ratio between (geometrically increasing) population growth and (arithmetically increasing) material resources. Paul Ehrlich\u2019s 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb, in true Malthusian fashion, famously proclaimed that \u201cthe battle to feed all of humanity is over [and that] civilization collapse is imminent.\u201d Interestingly, none of his dated predictions have come to pass.\n\nIndeed, the theory of universal implosion has been long discredited. Science writer Ronald Bailey, for example, puts paid to the thesis in The End of Doom, ridiculing the Malthusian refusal to \u201clet go of the simple but clearly wrong idea that human beings are no different than a herd of deer when it comes to reproduction.\u201d Humans are reasoning animals \u2014 at any rate, some humans \u2014 capable of dealing with pressing and seemingly intractable problems through genuine scientific discoveries and innovative approaches developed over time. As Matt Ridley mentions in his informative The Evolution of Everything, even Malthus was not a thoroughgoing catastrophist, proposing late marriage as a solution to overpopulation.\n\nNevertheless, our latter-day Malthusians, Resetters, and plutocratic Marxists persist in advancing their campaign, like avid but errant disciples of Francis Galton who claimed, \u201cWhat nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly, man may do providently, quickly and kindly.\u201d The \u201ckindly\u201d part soon dropped out of the formulation and negative eugenics, entailing involuntary sterilization, eventually emerged as a solution to the problem of overpopulation and declining resources. (As Nicholas Wright Gillham writes in his fascinating biography A Life of Sir Francis Galton, \u201cWhat eugenics wrought in the first half of the twentieth century was much worse than anything Galton would have envisioned.\u201d)\n\nFortunately, resistance is mounting. Important books have been published, like Michael Walsh\u2019s edited volume Against the Great Reset, Alex Jones\u2019 The Great Reset: And the War for the World, and Marc Morano\u2019s The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown (all highly recommended), that are eloquently and passionately sounding the alarm. So-called \u201cpopulist revolts\u201d in countries like France, Italy, and Sweden, (the latter two having elected new conservative administrations), as well as the MAGA movement in the U.S., are challenging a powerful conspiracy \u2014 not a conspiracy theory but a conspiracy fact \u2014 that seeks to destabilize the world order, uproot the foundations of long-standing usages and traditions, collapse the economic basis of the West and, in short, build back worse.\n\nThe class of power-mad manipulators behind the Great Reset pass themselves off as humanity\u2019s benefactors. We should be neither impressed nor influenced by their presumed concern for the welfare of mankind. They are agents of destruction, not laborers in the vineyard. Murray Rothbard wisely urges in Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature that \u201cthe challenge must take place at the core \u2014 at the presumed ethical supremacy of a nonsensical goal.\u201d The goal may be nonsensical, but it is real and dangerous. Nor do ethical considerations even remotely figure in the revolutionary agenda of our presumed Samaritan patrons.\n\nPerhaps the perfect storm can be weathered. Perhaps the ideological asteroid can be deflected. But it will take awareness, knowledge, and commitment on the part of more and more people if we are to emerge on the other side of the gathering cataclysm.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title":
