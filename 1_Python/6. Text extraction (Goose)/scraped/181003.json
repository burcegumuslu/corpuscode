She said the 79-year-old president is experiencing \u201cvery mild symptoms\u201d and will isolate himself for the time being.\n\n\u201c[Biden] will continue to carry out all of his duties fully \u2026 and work in isolation until he tests negative. Once he tests negative, he will return to in-person work.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jean-Pierre, Biden returned a negative COVID-19 test result on July 19, two days before he contracted the pathogen. Given his advanced age, the president falls under the at-risk group in terms of developing severe illness.\n\nShe continued that the former vice president under the Obama administration had \u201cbeen in contact with members of the White House staff by phone,\u201d and will join planned meeting \u201cvia phone and Zoom.\u201d The White House will also provide daily updates about Biden\u2019s status, added Jean-Pierre.\n\n\u201cPer standard protocol for any positive case at the White House, the White House Medical Unit will inform all close contacts of the president \u2013 including any members of Congress and any members of the press who interacted with [him].\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s positive COVID-19 result followed that of White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, who caught the virus in June.\n\nA June 15 statement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirmed Fauci\u2019s illness, stating that a rapid antigen test he took returned a positive result. Just like Biden, the 81-year-old Fauci had \u201cmild symptoms\u201d even though he was \u201cfully vaccinated and \u201cboosted twice.\u201d (Related: Shroyer: Quadruple-vaxxed Fauci LIED about COVID vaccines protecting people from infection.)\n\nThe NIH statement added that the infectious disease expert had not been in close contact with Biden or other senior officials before testing positive.\n\nGovernment officials prove the vaccines do not work at all\n\nBiden and Fauci are just two examples of prominent government officials who proved that the COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective in preventing infection. Despite receiving four vaccine doses, the two officials of advanced age still caught COVID-19.\n\nTwo members of the legislative branch, both part of the Democratic Party, also contracted SARS-CoV-2 following their vaccination.\n\nBack in April, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi contracted COVID-19 after attending events where she was in close proximity to vaccinated colleagues. Her deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill confirmed the test result on social media.\n\n\u201cAfter testing negative this week, Speaker Pelosi received a positive test result for COVID-19 and is currently asymptomatic. The speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, [and] encourages everyone to get vaccinated, boosted and [tested] regularly,\u201d Hammill wrote on April 7.\n\nPrior to this, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tested positive for COVID-19 in January. She was fully vaccinated and boosted, having received her booster dose during the 2021 fall season.\n\nAccording to a statement from her office at the time, Ocasio-Cortez was \u201cexperiencing symptoms and recovering at home.\u201d The congresswoman also called on Americans to \u201cget their boosters\u201d and follow public health guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHead over to BadMedicine.news for more stories about government officials catching COVID-19 despite multiple vaccine doses.\n\nWatch this Italian doctor showing that most COVID-positive patients are vaccinated.\n\nThis video is from the Chinese taking down EVIL CCP channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSens.
