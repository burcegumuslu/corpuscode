We live at a time when depression is approached as a disease. That has a good side. Depressed people are not judged against as weak or self-indulgent, as if they only need to try harder to lift themselves out of their sadness. Yet depression, for all the publicity surrounding it, remains mysterious, and those who suffer from it tend to hide their condition \u2013 the medical model hasn\u2019t removed a sense of shame. When you\u2019re in the throes of depression, it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that you are a failure and that the future is hopeless.\n\nBefore considering how to handle depression, let\u2019s ask the most basic question: Are you depressed? The bad side of the medical model arises when people rush to be medicated because they don\u2019t like how they feel. Doctors barely bother to get a correct diagnosis, because the easiest thing to do \u2013and the thing that patients demand \u2013 is to write a prescription.\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can get beyond this knee-jerk reaction.\n\nBecoming sad or blue isn\u2019t a sure sign of depression. Life brings difficulties that we respond to with a wide range of normal emotions: sadness, anxiety, resignation, grief, defeated acceptance, helplessness. Moods are cyclical, and if these feelings are your response to a tough event, they will subside on their own in time. If they linger, however, and there seems to be no definite cause or trigger, such as losing your job or the death of a loved one, depression is accepted as the conventional diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosing Depression\n\nDepression isn\u2019t one disorder, and even though an array of antidepressants have been thrown at the problem, the basic cause for depression remains unknown. For a diagnosis of major depression, which is more serious than mild to moderate depression, at least five of the following symptoms must be present during the same 2-week period:\n\u2022 Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities\n\u2022 Significant weight loss when not dieting, or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite\n\u2022 Insomnia or hypersomnia (sleeping too little or too much)\n\u2022 Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt\n\u2022 Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness\n\u2022 Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or specific plan for committing suicide\n\nIf you can count five or more of these as being present, know that your list must contain \u201cdepressed mood\u201d or \u201cdiminished interest or pleasure\u201d before you\u2019d be considered medically depressed. We\u2019ve come to recognize different kinds of depression that fit certain circumstances:\n\u2022 Dysthymia is mild, chronic depression. It must present for at least 2 years for a diagnosis of dysthymia.\n\u2022 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that generally arises as the days grow shorter in the autumn and winter.\n\u2022 Postpartum depression begins after a woman has given birth and may get worse as time goes on.\n\nEven though no one knows exactly what causes depression, it is clearly a state of internal imbalance. Balance is essential for the healthy functioning of both your body and your mind. The upsetting factors that make it more likely you will get depression form a long list: genetic predisposition, death or loss of loved one, major life events (even happy ones, like a graduation), other mental illnesses, substance abuse, childhood trauma, certain medications, serious illness, and personal problems such as financial troubles. What these things have in common is that they disrupt the normal balancing mechanisms of mind and body. A treatment that aims at restoring balance therefore makes the most sense, and you can participate in these.\n\nRebalancing yourself forms its own long list of things you can do:\n\u2022 Be aware that you are depressed and seek help.\n\u2022 Get enough sleep meaning a minimum of 8 hours a night.\n\u2022 Address situations that would make anyone sad, such as the wrong job, a bad relationship, normal grief, and serious loss. Don\u2019t passively wait for time to heal your wounds.\n\u2022 Claim your sense of self \u2013 depressed women in particular may show a pattern of giving away too much of themselves in a relationship, leading to a sense of weakness and low self-esteem.\n\u2022 Examine your reactions to difficult situations. You will often find that reacting with helplessness, passivity, retreating inside, and turning passive lie at the root of your depressed state.\n\u2022 Spend time with people who give you a reason to feel alive and vibrant. Avoid people who share your negative responses and attitudes. Depression in some sense is contagious.\n\u2022 Rely to a minimum on antidepressants and apply your main efforts to other therapies. Pills should be as short-term as possible. They work best in removing the top layer of sadness so that you have a clear space to address the real underlying issues.\n\u2022 Talk about your problems and share your feelings with those who can listen with empathy and offer positive steps.\n\u2022 Make friends with someone who has recovered from depression or is handling the condition well.\n\u2022 Find a wise person who can help you to undo your most negative beliefs by showing you that life has other, better possibilities.\n\u2022 Because everything on this list requires a choice, bringing yourself back into balance means that you are aware enough to make decisions and have the ability to put them into practice. Quite often depressed people feel too helpless and hopeless to face the right choices, in which case outside help is needed, meaning a therapist or counselor who specializes in depression.\n\nHere\u2019s a general picture of how to make a plan for your own healing.\n\nPsychotherapy, or talk therapy, works as well as medication for many people. It may be used alone or in combination with other forms of treatment. Studies have shown that psychotherapy can cause changes in brain function similar to those produced by medications. Focused, goal-oriented forms of therapy such as cognitive-behavior therapy appear to be the most effective in treating depression.\n\nDiet may play a part in protecting against depression. Mediterranean countries have low rates of depression compared to countries farther to the north\u2014and it isn\u2019t just because they get more sunlight or have a more relaxed way of life. One large-scale study tracked almost 3,500 people living in London for 5 years and found that those who ate a Mediterranean diet were 30% less likely to develop depression. Researchers speculate that the foods in the Mediterranean diet may act synergistically together. Olive oil, nuts, and fatty fish are rich in omega-3 and other unsaturated fatty acids, and fresh fruits and vegetables contain flavonoids and phytochemicals that are full of antioxidants and folates (B vitamins).\n\nAerobic exercise is a very effective for depression. It\u2019s been shown that moderate aerobic exercise done just 30 minutes a day, three times a week, can reduce or eliminate symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression and can help with severe depression.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, the \u201cfeel-good\u201d chemicals (which function as neurotransmitters). Less well known is the startling effect of exercise on the structure of your brain. Exercise stimulates the creation of new nerve cells in the hippocampus, your brain\u2019s center of learning and memory, so that it actually increases in size. This is especially relevant because depression, unless countered with effective therapy, causes the hippocampus to shrink in size. Exercise has also been shown to raise levels of serotonin and norepinephrine and to multiply the number of dendrite connections in neurons.\n\nYoga has been shown to lessen stress and anxiety and promote feelings of well-being. Communication between your body and your mind is a two-way street. Certain yogic practices can signal the brain that it\u2019s all right to relax and prompt the parasympathetic nervous system to initiate the relaxation response. For instance, slow, deep, conscious breathing is also a vital element of yogic practice. This form of breathing is very effective in prompting the relaxation response to counter elevated levels of stress hormones. Someone with depression might be advised to practice \u201cheart-opening\u201d postures that elongate their thoracic spine. They may be told to stand with their shoulder blades drawn together so that their lungs are lifted and they are able to breathe more freely. An important component of yoga is paying close attention to what\u2019s going on in the body at all times and locating and releasing any areas of tension. Yoga should ideally be practiced with the guidance of an experienced teacher.\n\nMeditation can be a useful treatment for both stress and mild-to-moderate depression. Numerous studies have examined the effects of mindfulness meditation, designed to focus the meditator\u2019s attention on the present moment. One study measured electrical activity in the brain and found increased activity in the left frontal lobe during mindfulness meditation. Activity in this area of the brain is associated with lower anxiety and a more positive emotional state. Subsequently, the researchers tested both a group that hadn\u2019t meditated as well as the meditators for immune function. They did this by measuring the level of antibodies they produced in response to a flu vaccine. The meditators had a significantly greater reaction, which indicates they had better immune function.\n\nI know that the easiest solution is to pop a pill, and in this country powerful forces back up the promise that drugs are the answer. Keep in mind that antidepressants only alleviate symptoms, and that in the long run couch therapy has proven just as effective in changing the brain responses associated with depression. The real goal should be to rebalance your life, gain control over the disorder, understand who you are, and elevate your vision of possibilities for yourself. All of that is harder than opening a pill bottle, but every positive choice leads to real healing and a much better life in the future.\n\nNote: The information in this article is intended for your educational use only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
