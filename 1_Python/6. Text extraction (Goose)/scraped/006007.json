This means that anyone who received an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine cannot \u2013 and might not ever be able to \u2013 access any of the data concerning the vaccine from the US government.Not satisfied by this complete lack of transparency, ICAN, through its attorneys, submitted an information request to the United Kingdom\u2019s FDA equivalent \u2013 the Medicines and Healthcare Products Registry Agency (MHRA) -- in April 2022 seeking information relating to its authorization of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, as well as that relating to its authorization of the Janssen Moderna , and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines.MHRA\u2019s initial response was to threaten to deny ICAN\u2019s request but, after ICAN pushed back and, in the case of the AstraZeneca vaccine, narrowed the scope of the request to seven specific items related to safety testing, MHRA dropped its objection. MHRA recently provided 166 pages of records containing the studies MHRA relied on to authorize AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine. One of these studies investigated biodistribution of the AstraZeneca vaccine, meaning where it goes in the body after injection, in mice. This study revealed that the viral vector DNA did not remain localized in the injection site but instead migrated to other organs. Disturbingly, the study found vector DNA in the sciatic nerves, bone marrow, livers, lungs, and spleens of the mice following vaccination.The study documents further revealed that, in early 2021, AstraZeneca was forced to amend its data sheet for the vaccine after concluding that there may have been a causal association between the vaccine and serious hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis.Another perhaps unsurprising revelation was the inclusion of a disclaimer that a number of vulnerable populations, such as pregnant and lactating women and immunocompromised persons, were excluded from pre-market human safety studies. In its Marketing Authorization Application, AstraZeneca stated that because these populations were excluded from the studies, the safety of the vaccine in these groups was unknown. This also led the UK\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) to recommend against the AstraZeneca vaccine for pregnant women \u2013 a sentiment that was echoed in the UK\u2019s vaccination schedule guide, commonly referred to as the \u201cGreen Book.\u201d final shocking revelation in the documents was the heavily redacted discussion of two individuals who developed serious immune-mediated neurological demyelinating conditions following vaccination. Although it states there was \u201cno evidence suggesting a causal relationship\u201d between the vaccine and these events, the UK\u2019s clinical overview conceded that \u201cvaccinations could be associated with immune-mediated neurological conditions\u201d and therefore these adverse events were included as an important potential risk in the vaccine\u2019s risk management plan.In the coming weeks, MHRA is expected to produce additional documents regarding its authorization of the other COVID-19 vaccines.SOURCE: h ttps://icandecide.org/press-release/ican-obtains-disturbing-information-about-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-from-the-uk-equivalent-of-the-fda/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n It isn't surprising that pregnant women were excluded from testing.

It is not a matter of defending positions, but rather of understanding the science. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Study shows risk of blood clots is far greater from coronavirus than the vaccine \n\n A study by the University of Oxford shows that having Covid-19 puts you at a much higher risk of developing dangerous blood clots than the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. \n\n \n\n The study, based on the health records of 29.1 million people in England, suggests while there is a slightly increased risk of developing low platelet levels and blood clots in the veins after a first dose of AstraZeneca, being infected with the virus raises this risk much more, and for longer.\n\n \n\n The researchers estimate that for every 10 million people who are vaccinated with AstraZeneca, there are 66 extra cases of blood clots in the veins and seven extra cases of a rare type of blood clot in the brain. Infection with Covid-19 is estimated to cause 12,614 extra cases of blood clots in the veins and 20 cases of rare blood clots in the brain. \n\n \n\n This research is more evidence that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks for most people. \n\n \n\n \n\n www.bhf.org.uk... \n\n \n\n osf.io... \n\n \n\n We have all understood the 'science' very well apart from the vaccine apologists, defenders of the pharmaceuticals, and denialists of reality and truth. \n\n \n\n Who is into denial about this is another thread. \n\n \n\n Yes another thread. But the vaccine apologetics and denialism of reality are constant and are seen usually in all threads. \n\n \n\n I haven't seen any of those, I've only seen some people looking at all sides and trying to find the truth while others cling onto their anti-vax beliefs and refuse to accept new findings by many medical and scientific studies. \n\n \n\n The entire site is full of vaccine apologists and denialists of reality. You may have to look closer and be more careful. In this site I don't think anyone who has looked at the evidence still thinks the vaccines are 'safe and effective'. Only vaccine apologists have these views or those who can't change their minds as they have emotionally invested in these products. \n\n \n\n The Astrazeneca vaccine was quitely but methodically withdrawn from the UK and most countries that have used it. Far from being a success. You don't really need links to see why. Just use common sense.
