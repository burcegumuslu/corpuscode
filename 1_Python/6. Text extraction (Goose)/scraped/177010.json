S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech.\n\nPfizer\u2019s vaccine, deemed 95 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses, is the first of several vaccines to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vaccines manufactured by Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson are expected to receive the green light from the FDA in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe Jewish authorities consulted for this story stressed that taking an FDA-approved vaccine is consistent with Judaism. Still, more than one poll has reported conflicted views about sectors of the Jewish public agreeing to get the vaccine, both in America and Israel.\n\nRabbi Shmuel Herzfeld of Ohev Sholom, an Orthodox synagogue in Washington, D.C., participated in the Moderna vaccine trial, posting video of himself receiving the shot to the video-sharing platform TikTok.\n\n\u201cWe have been given the Torah to live by its laws,\u201d said Herzfeld. \u201cThe value of preserving life is the essential, axiomatic value of Judaism. Over the next few months, we encourage our communities to go\u2014to run\u2014when it\u2019s their turn to get the vaccine.\u201d\n\nHerzfeld\u2019s participation in the clinical trial was an expression of religious faith and personal ethics. \u201cI wanted to try to make a difference in whatever way I could to help those on the front lines fighting this virus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was important to me as a person of faith to embrace the gifts G-d has given us.\n\n\u201cI believe the scientists are holy people,\u201d he added, \u201cand all the workers up and down the line who made the vaccines possible are incredible holy agents of our Creator.\u201d\n\nOther rabbis echoed Herzfeld\u2019s point about preserving and protecting life\u2014both that of the individual and of others.\n\n\u201cYou can overturn virtually every law in the Torah to save life, and there\u2019s no question that vaccination is overwhelmingly life-saving,\u201d said Danny Schiff, a Reform rabbi and foundation scholar at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. \u201cVaccination does two things\u2014it preserves your life and others.\u2019 Judaism wants to preserve the well-being of the individual, and the idea is we also have a responsibility to each other.\u201d\n\nRav Shoshana Mitrani Knapp, a New York-based spiritual leader and counselor ordained in the Conservative movement, said the idea expressed in Leviticus that \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself\u201d is consistent with the imperative to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a beautiful understanding in the Talmud that whoever sustains one soul has sustained the world,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthe web of connection between us and our fellow man or woman\u201d is supported by Torah teachings, including the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis. \u201cWhen Cain asks, \u2018Am I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u2019 the answer is \u2018Yes,\u2019 and this is foundational.\u201d\n\nRecommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the distribution of the vaccine list several groups in order of priority: health-care workers and nursing-home residents; other essential (non-health-care) workers; adults 65 years of age and up, along with those who have high-risk medical conditions; and then the general population. Rabbis and Jewish ethicists seem to agree with that.\n\nFrom both a \u201cpurely ethical\u201d and utilitarian perspective, \u201cyou vaccinate most the vulnerable first\u2014the elderly in nursing homes,\u201d said Rabbi David Wolpe, the religious leader of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, a conservative synagogue. Wolpe can see the argument, too, for prioritizing \u201cfrontlines workers who are forced out of their homes day after day.\u201d\n\nSeveral praised the decision to prioritize the vaccination of essential workers in health care, agriculture, education, law enforcement, transportation, firefighting, food distribution and sanitation.\n\n\u201cBoth the government\u2019s guidelines and Jewish law as I interpret it would have us save as many lives as possible,\u201d said Rabbi Elliot Dorff, professor of philosophy at American Jewish University in Los Angeles. \u201cI presume \u2026 non-health-care essential workers will get the vaccine before the elderly and those with medical conditions because people who stock grocery shelves and do other essential things to enable us to live need to be protected to do their jobs in the name of the communal good. \u2026 People can die of starvation as much as from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nDorff theorized that seniors living independently and those with medical conditions like him (he has asthma) can take steps to try to avoid becoming infected, such as isolating until they can get the vaccine, \u201cwhereas essential workers have no choice but to endanger themselves to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nWolpe noted that under the guidelines, \u201cpeople who do what we used to call menial jobs but we now understand to be essential jobs,\u201d such as janitors and sanitation workers, will \u201cget precedence over people who have more money and can afford to wait. I think that\u2019s a good thing for us to think about.\u201d\n\nPeter Salk, a virologist and son of the late Jonas Salk, the pioneering scientist who developed the vaccine for polio at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1950s, said he supports the guidelines to \u201cprotect vulnerable people and people who are helping to keep society moving.\u201d\n\nSalk spoke of the heavy toll of the pandemic on the African-American, Latino and Native American communities, pointing out that these sectors of society tend to be disproportionately represented among both essential workers and virus victims, and less likely to have the financial option of staying home to work.\n\nFrom an ethical perspective, Salk believes that it\u2019s important to understand that past mistakes on the part of America\u2019s medical establishment, such as the infamous 1932 Tuskegee study in which African-Americans were observed without their consent to assess the effects of untreated disease on a population, have contributed to people\u2019s distrust.\n\n\u201cCommunity leaders who are trusted will be most effective and needed now at helping people understand how these vaccines work,\u201d honestly communicating any potential downside to taking them, and imparting \u201cthe positive impact they can have for an individual and \u2026 the community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Cure is its own compulsion\u2019\n\nAs the COVID-19 vaccine rollout begins, authorities hope that enough Americans will take the vaccines to achieve herd immunity. While the exact threshold is unknown, experts estimate that between 75 percent and 85 percent of Americans will need to be vaccinated for that to be achieved. By some recent polls, as high a proportion as half of all Americans has said they have reservations about taking the vaccine.\n\nAllowing for medical exceptions, the Jewish value to preserve life would support mandating COVID-19 vaccination, if necessary, according to all rabbis and Jewish ethicists consulted for this piece.\n\nSome felt, however, that in a culture that prizes individual freedom, mandates could backfire.\n\nBecause vaccination protects both one\u2019s own life and the lives of others, Jewish law \u201cwould allow the government to mandate a COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d said Wolpe. However, he added that he thinks such a mandate \u201cwould not be a smart or productive strategy\u201d in the United States, and thus should be a last resort. Education to promote voluntary participation is a better route, he believes, because on a practical level, Americans tend to rebel against mandates as an assault on their liberty.\n\n\u201cCure is its own compulsion,\u201d said Wolpe. \u201cIf the vaccines work, that will be enough.\u201d\n\nSalk also believes that, if successful, the vaccines will sell themselves to the American people.\n\n\u201cPeople getting vaccinated [for COVID-19] will be protected from getting ill to a great extent; I think it will be obvious from the reality on the ground,\u201d said Salk. \u201cThere are always going to be some who have a different point of view, but most will want to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nSalk added that the gradual pace of the rollout may have the added benefit of making people \u201cwant [the vaccine] more.\u201d\n\nRabbi Yisroel Altein of Chabad Outreach in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh echoed a perspective heard from some other Americans, who according to polls favor a wait-and-see approach to taking the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe Chassidic community is like the rest of the world, where you have all different voices, but in my experience, the majority of the community is looking to be safe and vaccinate in general,\u201d said Altein. \u201cThe key is that the [coronavirus vaccine] is safe, and that obviously is up to the medical community. Seeing as that is what they are saying, I think it will be widely viewed as a way to protect everyone and try to get us through the pandemic already.\u201d\n\nRabbi Mark Wildes, the founder of Manhattan Jewish Experience who works with Jewish singles in their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s in New York, thinks that younger Americans will respond positively to opportunities to get the vaccine.\n\nIn addition to caring about older people and wanting \u201cto do the right thing,\u201d said Wildes, the young people with whom he works \u201cwant to go to work, to play sports, to date, to socialize, and if the vaccine is going to allow that, they are going to be flocking to it.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rabbis and Jewish Ethicists Praise COVID Vaccine; Encourage Its Use", "description": "There\u2019s no higher value in Judaism than protecting life itself, they say.
