Another\u2019s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was consistent with optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve, while another was diagnosed with acute 6th nerve palsy, which causes double vision and/or crossed eyes.\n\nThe fourth patient listed in the study had acute onset esotropia, a condition in which one eye is deviated inward.\n\n\u201cNine cardinal gaze showing the LE esotropia following 3 weeks after the COVID-19 vaccination in case 3.\u201d\n\nA study published on August 23rd, 2021 detailed the occurrence of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) which immediately followed a 2nd dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. CRVO is a condition in which the vein which drains blood from the retina is partially or completely closed, which can cause blurred vision and other sight problems. The patient in question was a 50-year-old \u201chealthy non-obese and non-smoking\u201d person.\n\nThe patient experienced \u201cretrobulbar pain,\u201d or pain behind his eye, in addition to redness and vision reduction.\n\nThe scientists who published the study reasoned that this report suggests that both mRNA-based and adenovirus vector vaccines can cause \u201cthromboembolic events\u201d or blood clots which are caused by other blood clots.\n\n\u201cThe CRVO immediately following the 2nd vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine in an otherwise healthy patient suggests that thromboembolic events may not only occur in vector-based but also in mRNA-based vaccines,\u201d the authors wrote in their study.\n\nAnother study collated 58 different documents, which included case reporters, photo essays, and a letter, the total data of which documented 94 patients with \u201cadverse ocular events.\u201d\n\nOf the 87 patients for which vaccine info was available: 55 were given the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, 20 people used AstraZeneca, six used Moderna, three people used BBIBP-Corv (China), two people used Corona Vac (China), and one person used Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine.\n\n\u201cVaccination-induced cranial nerve palsies have previously been reported following the influenza, hepatitis B, smallpox, and MMR vaccines. While the exact mechanism has not been elucidated, vaccine-induced cranial nerve palsies are believed to be due to immune-mediated damage resulting in demyelination or vascular compromise resulting in reduced blood flow. Given the aforementioned links between vaccination and vascular compromise as well as autoimmune phenomena, it is likely that these underlie the development of ocular motility disorders following COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d \u201cOcular Complications Following Vaccination for COVID-19: A One-Year Retrospective\u201d by Abid A.
