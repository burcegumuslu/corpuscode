At least a few people weren\u2019t having it. But the sad fact is they will literally never stop. Dr. Kory has a new piece in Daily Caller targeting our public health leaders\u2019 shameless arrogance and outlining three lessons for the next public health crisis. First, when a crisis hits, public health leaders should prioritize transparency and promote open debate. Throughout the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) restricted the flow of information and only published data that supported its narrow political objectives. But as we\u2019ve seen, facts will eventually come to light, and the cover-up is always worse than the crime\u2026 Second, don\u2019t pretend there is a silver bullet. Complex public health problems demand complex solutions \u2014 every time. Biden, Fauci and crew hung their entire COVID strategy on vaccines. In doing so, they made promises they could not keep and used absurd claims \u2014 like CDC Director Dr. Walensky insisting that vaccinated people couldn\u2019t spread COVID or even get sick \u2014 to force an agenda that only set Americans against one another. Of course, Walensky was forced to admit she was wrong on this (and plenty more). Yet the U.S. still requires international visitors to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and the world number one tennis player (Novak Djokovic), my favorite athlete, cannot enter our country to participate in upcoming tournaments. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis deserves credit for suggesting he could \u201crun a boat from the Bahamas\u201d for Djokovic to compete in the Miami Open tennis tournament later this month, but it should not come to that. There are other options to treat COVID, including re-purposing existing generic drugs. This is no longer a fringe cause. Russell Brand generated national headlines for taking the mainstream media to task for dismissing drugs like ivermectin, which have been promoted by the likes of Joe Rogan and Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThird, policymakers must recognize that snap crisis decisions can leave people hurt. No one expects a perfect public response, but there must be safety net for those who get caught up in the single-minded approach. Consider vaccine associated enhanced disease (VAED), the ghastly scenario where a vaccine not only fails to prevent transmission but creates a more serious illness in a vaccinated person than one who is unvaccinated. According to the CDC\u2019s \u201cV-safe\u201d safety monitoring system, 33% of people who received a COVID vaccine experienced severe adverse effects, and 7.7% have required hospitalization. I have never in my career prescribed any medicine or administered any therapy which even came close to a 1% risk of requiring medical attention as a result of that therapy. This risk of a treatment is unprecedented in the history of modern medicine. Those daring to raise the alarm on the unproven and dangerous nature of the vaccines have been persecuted relentlessly. The government program compensating those who have been injured by vaccines has been a black hole. As of late February, only 19 of the 11,196 claims \u2014 less than 1% \u2014 submitted to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) have been approved. In a time of desperation, Americans are grasping for help only to get mired in the vast government bureaucracy. Above all, the next public health emergency should be met with more humility and less arrogance. A once-in-a century crisis requires a spirit of open-mindedness\u2026 The PBS story shows this will be an uphill battle with people like Fauci and Bowser clinging to power and continuing to push failed strategies.
