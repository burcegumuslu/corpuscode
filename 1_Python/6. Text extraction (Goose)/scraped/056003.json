Whether it\u2019s skin dryness or hair loss, our bodies surely experience some normal effects that can be scientifically explained during this time of year. Needless to say, these changes vary from a person to another.\n\nOne of the biggest impacts of autumn on our bodies is skin dryness. It has been proven by dermatologists that every seasonal change in temperature acts as a shock to the system, disrupting the typical chemical balance of our skin and causing dryness. The arrival of autumn is no exception.\n\n2. Your hair could lose its quality and fall out.\n\nThis is particularly common, and while some people start freaking out, thinking that they might go completely bald, some believe that it\u2019s extremely normal during this season. The reason behind the hair fallout during autumn is the \u201cevolutionary leftover.\u201d This means that we need extra hair during the summer to protect our scalp from UV lights, but once the protection is not needed anymore, the hair starts shedding.\n\n3. You may sleep longer than usual.\n\nDuring fall, you may notice that you have a tendency to sleep more than before, and there is an explanation for this. Actually, the decrease in the amount of daylight in autumn influences the body\u2019s sleep-wake cycle. The less light exposure during the day, the more tired and fatigued you might feel.\n\nQuick tip: There isn\u2019t much you can do about this. On the contrary, try to enjoy the sun whenever you can catch some, and get as much rest as you can \u2014 it certainly can\u2019t do any harm.\n\nFall signals the end of summer and the coming of winter, so our brain sends signals to our body to increase its insulin resistance. Our bodies boost fat production, and we start storing fat so that we can prepare for winter and survive during the colder temperatures. So the moment the weather starts feeling a bit colder, we start craving ingredients high in carbs and fats.\n\n5. If you suffer from anxiety, you may experience a spike in symptoms.\n\nThe transition from summer to autumn might affect our mood and well-being \u2014 it\u2019s called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). During autumn, the anxiety may build up due to the beginning of a new school year, the looming stress of the holiday season, or possible regret from not having achieved desired goals over the summer, according to experts.\n\n7. Your body becomes particularly susceptible to the flu.\n\nAutumn is the change of seasons between summer and winter, so the weather is changing and so is the temperature. This change creates a favorable environment for the flu and other viruses, which is why people tend to get more sick during the fall, according to medical practitioners.\n\nPlease note: This article was updated in October 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.", "opengraph": {"description": "The arrival of\u00a0autumn means shorter days, changes in\u00a0the leaves, and the signal of\u00a0change in\u00a0human bodies and lifestyles.
