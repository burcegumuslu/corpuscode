CBS News has learned the family of Hannah Poling will receive more than $1.5 million dollars for her life care; lost earnings; and pain and suffering for the first year alone.\n\nIn addition to the first year, the family will receive more than $500,000 per year to pay for Hannah\u2019s care. Those familiar with the case believe the compensation could easily amount to $20 million over the child\u2019s lifetime.\n\nHannah was described as normal, happy and precocious in her first 18 months.\n\nThen, in July 2000, she was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor\u2019s visit: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nAfterward, her health declined rapidly. She developed high fevers, stopped eating, didn\u2019t respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits. In 2002, Hannah\u2019s parents filed an autism claim in federal vaccine court. Five years later, the government settled the case before trial and had it sealed. It\u2019s taken more than two years for both sides to agree on how much Hannah will be compensated for her injuries.\n\nContinue reading about Family to Receive $1.5M+ in Vaccine-Autism Court Award.", "opengraph": {"title": "Family to Receive $1.5M+ in Vaccine-Autism Court Award", "site_name": "MEDIA ROOTS \u2013 Reporting From Outside Party Lines", "image": "http://www.mediaroots.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ad2new.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "http://mediaroots.org/family-to-receive-1-5m-in-vaccine-autism-court-award/"}, "tags": ["health", "united states"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31727_162-20015982-10391695.html", "http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/CAMPBELLSMITH.%20DOE77082710.pdf", "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31727_162-20015982-10391695.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "September 22, 2010"}
