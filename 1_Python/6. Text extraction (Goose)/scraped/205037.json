Apparently none of this is enough to stop COVID-19, and the only solution is more injections.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, reported COVID-19 cases have hit a new world record for a single-day increase in any country. As of today, after hundreds of millions of people received coronavirus vaccine injections, with tens of millions of those individuals receiving \u201cbooster\u201d injections, the US is now reporting 484,377 new COVID-19 cases.\n\nDespite so many vaccinated individuals in the US being infected with COVID-19, former President Donald Trump maintains that the controversial injections are one of the \u201cgreatest achievements of mankind.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "96% Of Germans With Omicron Were 'Fully Vaccinated,' 28% Triple Vaxxed, Only 4% Unvaxxed, Government Said In December", "description": "Germans who had the Omicron variant of COVID-19 were overwhelmingly vaccinated, according to data released by the German government.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/96-germans-omicron-fully-vaccinated-28-triple-vaxxed-4-unvaxxed-government-says/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2021-12-30T21:02:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-04T23:15:55+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BeFunky-collage-23.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "650", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Europe", "Omicron Variant", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "Germany"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Source (Welt):<a href=\"https://t.co/5XCrr0DAYi\">https://t.co/5XCrr0DAYi</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1476584014546939907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">JUST IN \u2013 U.S. reports 484,377 new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> cases, setting a new world record for a single-day increase in one country.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1476630423786729474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Wochenbericht/Wochenbericht_2021-12-30", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://t.co/5XCrr0DAYi", "https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1476584014546939907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://nationalfile.com/vaccinated-variant-20-omicron-cases-found-unvaccinated-people-cdc-says/", "https://nationalfile.com/new-york-times-covid-boosters-may-cause-immune-system-fatigue-compromise-ability-fight-virus/", "https://nationalfile.com/netherlands-now-plans-6-jabs-covid/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1476630423786729474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://nationalfile.com/trump-tells-candace-owens-people-arent-dying-take-vaccine-claims-saved-100-million-people/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/coronavirus/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/europe/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/germany/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/omicron-variant/"], "authors": ["Archive"], "publish_date": "2021-12-30T21:02:12+00:00"}
