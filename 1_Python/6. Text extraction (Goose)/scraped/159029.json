In the present study, we aimed to evaluate parents' attitudes toward vaccinating themselves and their children. We also searched whether information about the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a severe complication of COVID-19, could change parents' decisions on vaccinating their children.\n\nMethods A questionnaire form consisting of sociodemographic features, COVID-19 vaccination practices, and knowledge about MIS-C was applied to parents of children attending Bezmialem Vak\u0131f University Hospital from March through June 2022. Factors affecting vaccine hesitancy were evaluated.\n\nResults Among 383 parents, COVID-19 history was present in 248 (64.8%), and 165 (43.1%) were hesitant to vaccinate themselves. The number of cases where both parents had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine was 256/354 (72.3%). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were vaccines being new in 53/165 (32.1%) and fears of side effects in 95/165 (57.6%). Parents' hesitation toward vaccination of their children with the COVID-19 vaccine was highest for the 0 to 6 age group (78.9%) (73.6% in the 6\u201312 age group, and 47.3% in the 12\u201318 age group). In total, 365/383 (95.3%) parents did not have an opinion about MIS-C. After information was given, 62.5% of the 302 participants who opposed vaccinating children under 6 years changed their decision to have their children vaccinated.\n\nConclusion Although routine childhood vaccinations were performed in 99% of children, more than half of parents were hesitant to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine. The majority did not have an opinion about MIS-C. Briefings by pediatricians about complications of COVID-19 will help avoid vaccine hesitancy.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.thieme-connect.de/media/10.1055-s-00029028/202303/lookinside/10-1055-s-0042-1760635_2200095-1.jpg", "/products/ejournals/buyDocument/10.1055/s-0042-1760635"], "authors": ["Department of Pediatric Infection, Faculty of Medicine, Bezmialem Vak\u0131f University (Central), Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye", "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Bezmialem Vak\u0131f University (Dragos), Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye", "0000-0001-8172-119X", "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Bezmialem Vak\u0131f University (Central), Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye", "Ali Toprak", "Selve \u00c7\u0131naro\u011flu Saka", "Cem Koray F\u0131rat", "\u00d6zden T\u00fcrel", "dr.selvasaka@gmail.com", "Department of Statistics, Faculty of Medicine, Bezmialem Vak\u0131f University (Central), Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye", "Hale Molla Kafi", "Zeynep Ebru \u00c7ak\u0131n"], "publish_date": null}
