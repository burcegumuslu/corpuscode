They continue to also be reported about the COVID jabs \u2013 including in children (see 1, 2, 3, 4). Nevertheless, American school districts have been sponsoring special events to encourage kids to become vaccinated. The governor of New York is increasing her state\u2019s efforts to target kids as well.\n\nHochul setting up 120 pop-up vaccination sites targeting kids across New York state\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul will deploy over 120 vaccination vans across to help boost vaccination rates among young New Yorkers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appealing to people personally but I\u2019m also hitting the road,\u201d said Hochul, who announced the latest escalation in her #Vaxtoschool campaign in Brooklyn Tuesday morning. \u201cWe are making it easy on you.\u201d\n\nKids between the ages of 12 and 17 will be able to get a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot at one of the state-run mobile sites beginning Wednesday, Sept. 23. The mobile units will continue to offer vaccinations to vaccine-eligible kids for the next twelve weeks.\n\nParents or guardians can set up an appointment for their child to get the vaccine at one of the pop-up sites by visiting ny.gov/vaxtoschool, texting their ZIP code to 438829 or by calling 800-232-0233.\n\nHochul also announced the launch of a new Instagram channel, @VaccinateNY, to educate school-aged New Yorkers and their families about the COVID-19 vaccine directly.\n\nOfficials encourage parents to ask if the site offers the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine which is the only inoculation children between the ages of 12 and 17 can get.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTeh vaccine is the only inoculation available to children 12 to 15 years of age under an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration and under full approval for kids 16 and older.\n\nA growing number of Americans \u2013 including health care workers (see 1, 2) and military personnel \u2013 are opposed to COVID vaccine mandates (see 1, 2, 3). Some experts have testified that the U.S. COVID death count is not being accurately reported.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
