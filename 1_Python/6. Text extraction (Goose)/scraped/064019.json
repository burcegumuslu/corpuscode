I said the ending of that article in the OP is unprofessional and sensationalistic, more like something one would find on the cover ofAnd it is. What does it say about a site and its position when it has to stoop to this level, in order to get people on its side?The trials seemed big enough to me. Six blood clots were found in the 30,000 trial for the Pfizer shot. Four out of the 6 were in the placebo group, that got a saline solution. Nasty ol' saline solution...(I put this down on this forum someplace, over a month ago--I don't know where it is now).Also, vaccines work. The number of new cases of last month had decreased by 80% or so in this country, the lowest since the pandemic began, with roughly 1/3 vaccinated. And that is without Ivermectin and HCQ.I don't think HCQ shows much promise, in what I have read, but ivermectin might. If so, more power to it. But don't forget--using them to fight covid-19 was experimental in a sense, since neither was designed to be an anti-viral medicine. But again, IF more research indicates that it is efficacious in precenting/treating covid-19, with few side effects, then more power to them.", "opengraph": {"description": "The end of your Op-Ed reads:\n\n\u201dthe time to demand reform is now; the time to halt the vaccine roll-out is at hand.
