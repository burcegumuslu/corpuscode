Good people.\n\nOnly about a third of Ukrainians have been vaccinated against Corona, in part with vaccines that are unapproved in the EU. The low vaccination rate could cause problems in the refugee centres. The city of N\u00fcrnberg, for example, has set up three gymnasiums to accommodate 600 people, where many must share a small space. \u2026 Anyone who wants to can receive a vaccination a few hundred metres away \u2026 free of charge for Ukrainian refugees. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re finding that the refugees aren\u2019t exactly snatching the vaccines out of our hands,\u201d says N\u00fcrnberg Mayor Marcus K\u00f6nig. \u201cMany new arrivals are very worried about \u2018forced vaccinations\u2019,\u201d adds Thomas Jung, Mayor of F\u00fcrth. He says you have to approach the topic with sensitivity. \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been months of overt coercion to accept vaccination from politicians and the press here in the Federal Republic of Germany. Months of social exclusion and jeopardised careers and all the rest of it. Nobody has given the slightest thought to \u201csensitivity.\u201d Why are they now at pains to accommodate the feelings of Ukrainians?\n\nJung explains that city officials pressed a Ukrainian doctor into service, to begin delicately preaching the Gospel of Vaccination to refugees last Friday. It\u2019s rare, because the West is so totalising, but every now and then you get an idea of what it must be like to look into this funhouse from the outside. You flee a war-zone and end up sleeping on the floor of some repurposed gym, while the locals scheme madly about how to inject you with their latest mRNA tech.\n\nDear Ukrainians: You\u2019re entirely right to be terrified of forced vaccination. We are too.", "opengraph": {"title": "Germany Discovers Ukrainian Refugees Are Uninterested in Vaccination, and Wary of the Vaccinators", "description": "\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re finding that the refugees aren\u2019t exactly snatching the vaccines out of our hands\u201d", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/germany-discovers-ukrainian-refugees-are-uninterested-in-vaccination-and-wary-of-the-vaccinators/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/06574456-750x454.jpg", "image:width": "793", "image:height": "480", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2022-03-22T10:17:48+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-22T10:17:48+01:00", "article:tag": "The Vaccine Taliban", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Politics", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/06574456.jpg", "updated_time": "2022-03-22T10:17:48+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": ["The Vaccine Taliban"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://substack.com/profile/15736836-eugyppius", "https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/ukrainische-gefluechtete-und-corona-angst-vor-zwangsimpfung,T0LVb1A"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2022-03-22T10:17:48+01:00"}
