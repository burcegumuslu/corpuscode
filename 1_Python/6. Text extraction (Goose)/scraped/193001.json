Here, Niket Sonpal, MD, a New York-based internist and gastroenterologist, discusses what to eat (and avoid) after your shot (and really, always) for a robust immune system.\n\nSpecifically, fruit and veg rich in vitamin C can help the body produce more white blood cells (the type that fight infections and diseases), Dr. Sonpal says. Citrus fruits like grapefruits, oranges and lemons contain high levels of vitamin C, but red bell peppers are an even richer source, he says.\n\nWhat's more, green vegetables like broccoli and spinach are abundant in antioxidants that work to protect your cells from harmful free radicals, Dr. Sonpal says. That's important because free radicals \u2014 unstable molecules that damage DNA and proteins within our cells \u2014 can cause oxidative stress, which may potentially make you more vulnerable to developing disease, he explains.\n\nResearch shows that omega-3 fats may not only help prevent heart disease and stroke but may also help manage autoimmune illnesses like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and potentially protect against cancer and other conditions, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\"Water is vital to ensuring the body can battle foreign cells and diseases,\" Dr. Sonpal says. \"When a person is sick, their body loses water to things like fever, nasal congestion, diarrhea and vomiting, so it is imperative that these lost fluids are replaced.\"", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Your diet can't prevent or cure COVID, but certain foods can better support your immune system after the vaccine, as it works to form antibodies to the virus.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764018-foods-to-eat-after-vaccine/", "title": "6 Foods to Eat (and 2 to Avoid) After the COVID Shot, According to a Doctor | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty/e3e8a1ef7ff04852bb21f87d0435363e.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.livestrong.com/article/13732163-reasons-to-get-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13721069-anti-inflammatory-foods/", "https://niketsonpal.com/about-me/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13723669-boost-your-immune-system/", "/article/13725589-foods-to-eat-when-sick/", "/article/342656-the-best-foods-to-eat-while-recovering-from-illness/", "/article/194306-the-best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-a-fever/", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "/article/13725589-foods-to-eat-when-sick/", "/article/342656-the-best-foods-to-eat-while-recovering-from-illness/", "/article/194306-the-best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-a-fever/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13732197-foods-high-in-vitamin-c/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/250888-what-foods-drinks-are-high-in-antioxidants/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4997300/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13721062-walnuts-health-benefits/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22187094", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13732199-foods-high-in-omega-3/", "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/omega-3-fats/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725962-protein-and-immune-system/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/194306-the-best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-a-fever/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731636-foods-high-in-zinc/", "https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/oysters-and-vibriosis.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13724994-what-weakens-immune-system/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13729138-boost-immune-system-coronavirus/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763718-covid-vaccine-guilt/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731521-covid-vaccine-facts/"], "authors": ["Jaime Osnato"], "publish_date": null}
