In many cases, they die suddenly within hours of getting the shot. In others, death occurs within the span of a couple of weeks\n\u2022 Ironically, when seniors die before vaccination, it\u2019s due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it, but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventive action is necessary\n\u2022 Several areas have reported that deaths are rapidly increasing after vaccination programs are implemented, including in Gibraltar, which prior to a vaccine had recorded a total of 10 deaths due to COVID-19. Eight days into the vaccination program, the death toll had risen to 45\n\u2022 Norway has recorded 29 senior citizen deaths in the wake of their vaccination push. Most were over the age of 75\n\u2022 Aside from sudden death, examples of side effects include persistent malaise and extreme exhaustion, severe allergic, including anaphylactic reactions, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, psychological disturbances, seizures, convulsions and paralysis, including Bell\u2019s Palsy\n\nAround the world, reports are pouring in of people dying shortly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. In many cases, they die suddenly within hours of getting the shot. In others, death occurs within the span of a couple of weeks.\n\nOne notable case is baseball legend Hank Aaron, 86, who died January 22, 2021, 17 days after publicly getting vaccinated for COVID-19.1,2 He said at the time that he hoped other Blacks would follow his lead and get their vaccines too.\n\nAccording to news reports, he died \u201cpeacefully in his sleep\u201d and no cause of death had been announced. Aaron was famous for being the home-run king of baseball, and broke Babe Ruth\u2019s record when he hit homerun No. 715; he had hit 755 by the time he retired from the sport.\n\nIn related news, Norway has recorded 29 senior citizen deaths in the wake of their vaccination push.3 Most were over the age of 75. A total of 42,000 Norwegians had by that time received the vaccine.\n\nWhile health officials initially downplayed any connection to the vaccine, a report in Bloomberg suggests the Norwegian Medicines Agency are now reconsidering. At the time of the deaths, the Pfizer vaccine was the only COVID-19 vaccine available in Norway, so \u201call deaths are thus linked to this vaccine,\u201d the agency told Bloomberg.4\n\n\u201c\u2019There are 13 deaths that have been assessed, and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed,\u2019 the agency said. All the reported deaths related to \u2018elderly people with serious basic disorders,\u2019 it said.\n\n\u2018Most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition\u2019 \u2026\n\nThe findings have prompted Norway to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines may be too risky for the very old and terminally ill, the most cautious statement yet from a European health authority.\n\nThe Norwegian Institute of Public Health judges that \u2018for those with the most severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences. For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway, the benefit of the vaccine may be marginal or irrelevant.\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, commented that the deaths have to be \u201cput into context with the population they occurred in.\u201d5\n\nIn other words, they were old and old people die. It\u2019s hypocrisy at its finest. When seniors die before vaccination, it\u2019s due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it, but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventive action is necessary.\n\nThe World Health Organization added that since there was \u201cno certain connection\u201d of the vaccines to Norway\u2019s deaths, there is no reason to discontinue giving it to senior citizens.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Race", "Predictions: from the past or for the future", "Coronavirus", "Health", "Commentary", "Israel, 'Anti-Semitism', Zionism and US-UK allies", "Health and the New World Order", "Essential Reading", "Hidden and Revisionist History"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/11/18/first-covid-19-vaccine-90-percent-effective.aspx", "https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/02/02/covid-vaccine-death-seniors.aspx"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
