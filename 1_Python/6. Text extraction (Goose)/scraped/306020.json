They have not. And that they haven\u2019t offers some clarity about the relative effectiveness of different Covid interventions,\u201d David Leonhardt wrote in the NYT newsletter.\n\nRestaurants in America\u2019s most liberal cities are still seating customers at only 40% of pre-pandemic levels, while restaurants in cities like Miami; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina, have fully recovered, according to the NYT.\n\n\u201cNationwide, the number of official Covid cases has recently been somewhat higher in heavily Democratic areas than Republican areas,\u201d the NYT newsletter read. \u201cThere is a strong argument for continuing to remove other restrictions, and returning to normal life.\u201d\n\nUnlike other precautions, vaccination rates were closely related to death rates, and areas that voted for former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election saw approximately double the COVID-19 death rate than areas that voted for President Joe Biden, according to the NYT.\n\n\u201cIf a new variant emerges, and hospitals are again at risk of being overwhelmed, then reinstating Covid restrictions may make sense again, despite their modest effects. But that\u2019s not where the country is today,\u201d the newsletter concluded.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
