Even experimenter Ke Cheng, who conducted these tests, admits that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say [he is] 100% confident\u201d about the way the therapy will fare in human trials. Here\u2019s an inconvenient fact: The National Institutes of Health says that 95% of all new drugs that are shown to be safe and effective in animal tests fail in human trials. If we are serious about effectively and swiftly combatting COVID-19, we need to modernize the stale and inefficient drug-development process by shifting from relying on animal tests to prioritizing human-relevant, non-animal testing strategies. Moderna, Pfizer, and BioNTech didn\u2019t wait for lengthy and unreliable tests on monkeys and mice before initiating human clinical trials on their vaccines, proving that animal tests aren\u2019t needed to develop safe and effective drugs.\n\nIt\u2019s time to shift the focus away from yesterday\u2019s science and to embrace the new model that these COVID-19 vaccine makers have pioneered\u2014and to take it a step further by replacing animal tests with more reliable and human-relevant animal-free ones. For the sake of human health, it\u2019s time for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to replace its lengthy, animal-intensive drug-development process with one that emphasizes human-relevant science.
