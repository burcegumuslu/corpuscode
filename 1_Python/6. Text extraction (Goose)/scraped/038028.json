I am open to getting a job, I am basically disabled with reduced hours, and I am 52 years old. The job I was put into was bathroom cleaning, which is totally back breaking work. It is like nothing you can image. You need to be young to work such a job, to kneel down to scrub the showers and bathtubs that are done daily. To clean filthy toilets. At my age and with my disability, I went along with it without complaint but I was getting more and more exhausted daily to the point I could barely even drive because I was that dizzy. My work would have gotten worse and worse as time went on, but I was saved. Apparently, according to an email from my employer I received on Tuesday, I need to send proof of my vaccination by Friday.\n\nnot to be followed\n\nNazi: I was told to kill several hundred people. It is not my responsibility they were killed at my hand. I was just doing my job. (Didn't work then, won't work now.)\n\nOh Gosh I had to laugh. With my disability that was CAUSED originally by vaccination, a vaccination injury obtained in 1991, I was not having any vaccination. Yes, I'm a hold out, and with SO MANY (alleged) vaccination injuries around, I'm sure many are holdouts as well, because let's face it, being jabbed can sometimes not be for your best health, not that you can ever prove it, but you know. I know. But you suffer in silence for your entire life. Enough said.Now it is very interesting how this happened. I could not say \"no\" to this job, and that is fine. I was hired by a woman on the phone after an 8 minute chat, and never did I meet a single person who worked at this cleaning business including bosses. I was told there was a uniform but it was never given to me. There is a free subsidy that equals my weekly pay given to the employers. I was told they accepted the subsidy. Do you see where this was going? I received no training and I had no experience doing cleaning. Do you see it yet? After these 8 minutes on the phone, I was told where to pick up my equipment - from outside someones house and I never met them.I was not the only person hired. They phoned my employment provider and they hired several women. Despite the fact it was DES, or Disabilty Employment Service provider, I was never asked my age, and they never asked me what disability I had. It is kind of an insult because (1) they are so money hungry they can hardly see straight, (2) you make all these mistakes because you have no training and they don't mind the errors you make, you don't get told off and they entirely forgive you for these mistakes. Well it sounds pretty suspicious, doesn't it? I realise I am a throw away employee. I'm not stupid.This is how it works in Australia. I have seen many people who were forced into jobs they aren't suitable for, forced to work for long hours in something they don't want. And I have seen so many people who walk away from these jobs, included a blind girl with a seeing-eye dog who is forced to work on a computer she can't even see. Of course when you leave this job you are penalised. Big time. This particular girl lost her property and lost her independence and was forced to move home and live in a room there. A grown up woman. She had a nervous breakdown. Maybe this isn't pretty to hear, but this happens constantly to unemployed people in Australia.You cannot use a doctor's certificate to get time off, or for any illness you have. If you give them a doctor's certificate, they will place it face down on the table and ask you who youto get this done. This actually happened to me!! You think there are legal recourses for this treatment? Not unless you are rich enough to fly over to America (Centrelink is an American company and has nothing to do with the Australian government), rich enough to stay in America (it would take years for such a case to be heard). Of course you are unemployed so you have no money. There is nothing you can do.When you do have a medical certificate (and I do), you will undergo an assessment with a woman on the phone. It took 8 weeks to get the appointment, I was assessed by a desk girl with NO MEDICAL EXPERIENCE, who asked me dismissively if that was the only thing I had, and who told me my doctor's certificate wasand who gave me hours of working that far exceeded what I can do. Are you getting it yet? People in this country are tortured often and repeatedly, and you will never hear about it on the news. I HAVE A DOCTOR'S CERTIFICATE. How can a desk girl overturn what a doctor has said, and do it legally? They do it regularly, and there is nothing you can do.By the way, when some Karen tells you it's not her fault and yes you must work these hours, and you are so sick and dizzy (and old) and you can hardly do anything...well, your work is going to suffer. I hear the same excuse given by the Nazis. \"I am doing what I was told to do. It's not me, I'm told to do this.\" And they think they have no karma in this?We are forced to sign a contact with our providers on the first day, and if we don't sign, we will not get unemployment payment. So...obviously we sign it. The system then has us, and we can do nothing to get out of it. If a job comes up, you are forced into it, even if it is not the right job for you.And with the vaccine injury I have (allegedly), I will never be vaxxed. And it is strange that I say this but after being fired from my job for not being vaxxed, I finally get it. This particular employer is now OUT TO GET ME. I did all they said, I turned up on time for every job and I cleaned by heart out, but now that their free money, the subsidy, got cut off, they have reported me, yes, and complained about me. I finally understand. These people are so corrupt themselves I now see clearly what is going on.KARMA. Clear and simple. The people in Australia are so corrupt, it is so damn rude here and you get treated like rubbish so often, people are receiving their own karma!Australia, wake the hell up!\n\nThis article is copyright of AskingAngels.com.
