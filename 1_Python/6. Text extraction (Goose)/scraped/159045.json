The primary outcome was defined as any vaccine-related complaints as defined in the original safety data. Secondary outcomes included specific complaints, COVID-19 screening test, and positive COVID-19 test.\n\nResults Eighty-three vaccinated pregnant persons were age-matched with 166 female controls, all of whom were vaccinated between December 2020 and January, 2021. There was no difference in race or ethnicity between the groups. The mean body mass index of pregnant patients was lower than that of controls (26.1 vs. 29.2, p = 0.002). The frequency of complaints following vaccine administration was not different between pregnant and nonpregnant patients (18.1 vs. 16.9%, p = 0.201). Pregnant individuals were more likely to report fever (4.8 vs. 0.6%, p = 0.044) and gastrointestinal symptoms (4.8 vs. 0%, p = 0.012).\n\nConclusions Side effect profiles of COVID-19 vaccine administration at our institution were relatively similar between pregnant and nonpregnant individuals and no serious complications occurred in either group. As COVID-19 infection in pregnancy can have significant morbidity, our data support the continued use of the vaccine for pregnant patients.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/products/ejournals/buyDocument/10.1055/a-1745-1168", "javascript:;", "https://www.thieme-connect.de/media/ajp/202213/lookinside/10-1055-a-1745-1168_210248-1.jpg"], "authors": ["Ochsner Health, Department of Women's Services, New Orleans, Louisiana", "Angela Nakahara", "0000-0001-8470-2314", "Frank B.
