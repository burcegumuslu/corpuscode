Rochelle Walensky and Robert Califf claimed in the response that Dr. Joseph Ladapo, the surgeon general, was misleading the public by focusing on the increase in adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\n\u201cThe claim that the increase of VAERS reports of life-threatening conditions reported from Florida and elsewhere represents an increase of risk caused by the COVID-19 vaccines is incorrect, misleading, and could be harmful to the American public,\u201d Walensky and Califf said in the missive.\n\nWalensky heads the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Califf heads of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The CDC and FDA co-manage VAERS, which accepts reports from anybody but which is primarily used by healthcare workers.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines were given emergency authorization in late 2020. Under the emergency authorizations, vaccine companies and healthcare workers are required to report certain adverse events through VAERS, \u201cso more reports should be expected,\u201d Walensky and Califf said.\n\n\u201cMost reports do not represent adverse events caused by the vaccine and instead represent a preexisting condition that preceded vaccination or an underlying medical condition that precipitated the event,\u201d they said.\n\nThey did not cite any studies or other research to support the claim.\n\nWhile anyone can lodge reports with the system, authorities request medical records and other documentation in an effort to verify reports of certain events. Out of 1,826 reports of heart inflammation after Pfizer or Moderna vaccination in adults through May 26, 2022, for instance, the CDC verified 72 percent.\n\nThe CDC also identified hundreds of safety signals for the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines through analyzing VAERS data in 2022, according to records obtained by The Epoch Times. A safety signal is a possible sign of a side effect. Only a handful of adverse events are definitely caused by the vaccines, according to the CDC, including myocarditis, or heart inflammation, and severe allergic shock.\n\nLadapo said in February that in Florida, the number of reports to VAERS after the COVID-19 vaccines were authorized spiked by 1,700 percent, while the increase in vaccine administration rose by just 400 percent.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen this type of response following previous mass vaccination efforts pushed by the federal government,\u201d Ladapo said in a letter to Walensky and Califf.\n\n\u201cThese findings are unlikely to be related to changes in reporting given their magnitude, and more likely reflect a pattern of increased risk from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d he added, calling for \u201cunbiased research \u2026 to better understand these vaccines\u2019 short- and long-term effects.\u201d The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.\n\nFlorida officials pointed to a study that found in the original clinical trials that the vaccinated were more at risk of serious adverse events, as well as other papers that found an increased risk of adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nFlorida currently recommends against COVID-19 vaccination for young, healthy males who have been shown to be at the highest risk of myocarditis. Vaccinating the population \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d from a risk-benefit standpoint, Ladapo, appointed by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, told The Epoch Times. The heart inflammation causes serious problems and can even lead to death in some cases.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-fda-respond-to-florida-surgeon-generals-covid-19-vaccine-safety-alert_5119568.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/rochelle-walensky-4-870x522.jpg?itok=_hTviSIh", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23706302-cdc-fda-letter-to-florida-surgeon-general", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/exclusive-cdc-finds-hundreds-of-safety-signals-for-pfizer-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccines_4956733.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/florida-surgeon-general-sends-vaccine-safety-alert-life-threatening-condition-reports-jump-by-4400-percent_5062648.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23706800-florida-surgeon-general-letter-to-cdc-fda", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/vaccinated-at-higher-risk-of-serious-adverse-events-reanalysis-of-original-trial-data_4707356.html", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10928-z", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2793348", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/florida-surgeon-general-recommends-against-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-for-males-aged-18-39_4783372.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/florida-surgeon-general-data-show-messenger-rna-covid-19-vaccines-shouldnt-be-given-to-young-men_4801262.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-fda-respond-to-florida-surgeon-generals-covid-19-vaccine-safety-alert_5119568.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
