Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete, and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders.\u201d\n\nOnly once, or if, a consensus agrees that the effects of AI system implementation \u201cwill be positive and their risks will be manageable\u201d should the world allow for the wide-scale adoption of AI as a welcome addition to the world, the petition concludes.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: the powers that be are only concerned that THEY might become obsolete by AI\n\nAt first glance, the true motivation behind this petition and Musk\u2019s signing of it seems to be more about protecting those \u201cfulfilling\u201d jobs than it is about protecting the non-fulfilling ones.\n\nThe oligarch class has never cared about ordinary people losing their jobs to machines, or any of the other society-destroying technologies that have come to bear. It is only when AI started to become powerful enough to replace Hollywood actors, for instance, or high-level politicians that suddenly AI is a problem.\n\nVoice actors, as another example, are freaking out that their high-paying gigs are drying up the more that AI robots learn how to mimic voices for free. When the millionaires and billionaires start to feel like their positions in society are threatened by AI, in other words, that is when petitions like this suddenly start to circulate.\n\nFor at least the next six months, the petition states, there should be a \u201cpublic and verifiable\u201d pause on all AI systems that are more powerful than the ChatGPT-4 AI robot that is all the rage in recent months.\n\nAn independent oversight board with \u201crigid auditing\u201d capabilities must be able to ensure that these advanced AI robots are \u201csafe beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d before such projects are ever allowed to proceed.\n\nIn addition to Musk, other well-known signatories of the petition include Steve Wozniak (co-founder of Apple), Jaan Tallinn (co-founder of Skype, Future of Life Institute), Evan Sharp (co-founder of Pinterest), Emad Mostaque (CEO of Stability AI), and numerous others, including professors and executives at MIT and Harvard, and even the CEOs of various AI start-up companies.\n\n\u201cI fear that AI may replace humans altogether,\u201d warned the late physicist Stephen Hawking in an interview with Wired magazine that was reportedly seen by Cambridge News.\n\n\u201cIf people design computer viruses, someone will design AI that improves and replicates itself. This will be a new form of life that outperforms humans.\u201d\n\nMusk agrees, having stated that he himself should be \u201con the list of people who should absolutely *not* be allowed to develop digital superintelligence\u201d because of what could come about from his involvement in the industry.\n\nIn the comments, someone wrote that she believes AI will not replace humans so much as it will be used \u201cby horrible humans to control, torment, vaccinate, and / or exterminate other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe human monsters we are dealing with right now are dangerous enough,\u201d this person added.\n\nThe latest news about the AI takeover of the world can be found at Transhumanism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Elon Musk signs Future of Life Institute petition calling for all major AI developments to be PAUSED", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-04-03-elon-musk-petition-major-ai-developments-paused.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "The Future of Life Institute is circulating a petition that calls for an immediate end to all major artificial intelligence (AI) projects, citing their existential threat to human life.
