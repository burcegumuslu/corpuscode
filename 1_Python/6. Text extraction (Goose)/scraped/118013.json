They tested it out on mice already, and it appears to have been a success.\n\n\u201cZhang and colleagues have demonstrated that a shortened mRNA code of 675 base pairs could be loaded into phospholipid packets called exosomes derived from milk and then using that same milk, be fed to mice,\u201d explains Dr. Peter McCullough, MD, MPH, in one of his latest Substack newsletters.\n\n\u201cThe mice gastrointestinal tract absorbed the exosomes and the mRNA must have made it into the blood stream and lymphatic tissue because antibodies were produced in fed mice against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (receptor binding domain).\u201d\n\nUnless you want to consume covid \u201cvaccines,\u201d you\u2019d better start only buying organic, pastured-raised meat and dairy products\n\nThe researchers who undertook this endeavor declared it a \u201csuccess\u201d in that it worked successfully to \u201cvaccinate\u201d the rodents. But is this actually a good thing?\n\nSeeing as how millions of people have been injured or killed by direct injection of mRNA poisons, the prospect of billions more consuming mRNA-tainted milk from conventional cows stands to add even more carnage to the statistics.\n\nThe official figures suggest that one in four Americans remains unvaccinated for covid. Adding mRNA to the food supply via conventional cow\u2019s milk is one way the powers that be aim to reduce the percentage of unvaccinated people both in the United States and around the world.\n\n\u201cThis group would have strong objections to mRNA in the food supply, particularly if it was done surreptitiously or with minimal labelling / warnings,\u201d McCullough writes about the un-jabbed. \u201cChildren could be targeted with easily administered oral vaccine dosing or potentially get mRNA through milk at school lunches and other unsupervised meals.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those who have taken one of the COVID-19 vaccines, having milk vaccines as an EUA offering would allow even more loading of the body with synthetic mRNA which has been proven resistant to ribonucleases and may reside permanently in the human body.\u201d\n\nThe fact that such technology now exists and works as intended, it is safe to assume that mRNA poisons are already in the conventional food supply. As usual, communist China is at the forefront of this new forced vaccination campaign, which just like with GMOs (genetically modified organisms) will be hidden and unknown to the average person.\n\n\u201cAll the more reason to support your local farmer,\u201d one commenter wrote about these horrific developments. \u201cKnow where your food comes from and what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear they have to comply with the FDA in order to have their meat slaughtered,\u201d worried someone else.\n\n\u201cGeez. This is the stuff of horror films but it\u2019s actually true,\u201d lamented another about how it is just one nightmare after another with all this nonstop covid madness.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly insidious,\u201d said another. \u201cFood as a bioweapon. There\u2019s no end to it. I\u2019m already vax-injured and I\u2019m going to change my screen name to Scared S***less. But maybe I should be glad I\u2019m 72 already.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the mRNA contamination of the food supply can be found at FrankenFood.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "China successfully \u201cvaccinates\u201d mice for covid by feeding them mRNA-tainted cow\u2019s milk", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.food.news/2023-04-11-china-vaccinates-mice-covid-mrna-cow-milk.html", "site_name": "Food News", "description": "The genocidal maniacs at the top of the food chain have developed a new way to mass-\u201cvaccinate\u201d the public for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) without people even knowing about it.
