The state won a court order halting a UNICEF tetanus program that was using tetanus vaccine secretly laced with an abortion drug. Anti-hCG-laced vaccines had also been found in at least four other countries.\n\nA Gates Foundation spokesperson declined to comment on the arrest warrant on Thursday, telling local radio: \u201cThis is a misunderstanding that we are going to have ironed out.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
