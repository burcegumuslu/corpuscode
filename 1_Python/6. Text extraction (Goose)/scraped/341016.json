Live In Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nA riveting new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today first noting Chairman Alexei Kudrin of the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation revealing: \u201cAccording to various estimates, the losses of the world economy from the pandemic total from $4 trillion to $10 trillion, with the bulk of those losses accounting particularly for budgets of regions and municipalities...Health, social support systems have demonstrated unreadiness for global shocks\u2026 Today\u2019s task of state bodies and supervisory agencies at all levels is to draft mechanisms that will enable those systems to become more stable and efficient\u201d, says in response to this \u201cglobal shock\u201d, it sees American leftist tech multi-billionaire Bill Gates calling for the United States and United Kingdom to invest billions-of-dollars into a global pandemic task force running \u201cgerm games\u201d to prepare for future outbreaks or biological attacks.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members agreeing that instead of running \u201cgerm games\u201d, the United States would be better served playing a \u201ctruth game\u201d\u2014most particularly like the \u201ctruth game\u201d played by famed National Football League legend Aaron Rodgers this past week, who during what\u2019s called an \u201cexplosive vax interview\u201d laid waste to the Covid scamdemic\u2014was an interview wherein Rodgers said he didn\u2019t need an experimental Covid jab because of his good health, lifestyle and natural immunity\u2014saw Rodgers revealing that he\u2019s been tested over 300 times for Covid, and whose positive test this week came from him being in contact with a vaccinated person\u2014saw Rodgers saying that the idea that \u201cunvaccinated people are the most dangerous people in society\u201d is the leftist media\u2019s \u201cpropaganda narrative\u201d\u2014then it saw Rodgers stating and asking: \u201cThis idea that it\u2019s a pandemic of the unvaccinated, it\u2019s a just a total lie...If the vaccine is so great, then how come people are still getting Covid and spreading Covid and unfortunately dying from Covid?...If the vaccine is so safe, then how come the manufactures of the vaccine have full immunity from lawsuits?\u201d\u2014\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript examining the issue of the socialist Biden Regime giving Covid experimental vaccine makers \u201cfull legal immunity from lawsuits\u201d, note that injury and/or death claims from all vaccines in America are adjudicated through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), that in fiscal year 2021, caused the US government to pay out $246.9-million in claims for vaccine-related injuries and deaths\u2014but for Covid experimental vaccine injuries and deaths, the CICP hasn\u2019t paid anything\u2014a strange occurrence when noticing that the US government logged more than 726,000 Covid vaccine injuries and deaths between 14 December 2020 and 17 September 2021\u2014but whose strangeness disappears because the Biden Regime quietly changed the law, and today sees it being: \u201cThe Covid fund is not authorized to provide reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees...A Covid vaccine-injured child would only be reimbursed for \u201creasonable medical expenses\u201d...Since the child survived and isn\u2019t employed, there\u2019s no other compensation...The Covid fund allows a one-year window to file a claim whereas the regular vaccine fund has a three-year window\u201d.\n\nWhile the socialist Biden Regime was quietly changing US law so those injured or killed by experimental Covid vaccines can\u2019t be fully compensated, this report continues, the investigative journalists at Technofog-Substack uncovered secret US government emails shockingly proving that the CDC changed to definition of vaccine when they discovered that experimental Covid jabs weren\u2019t working\u2014in August-2021, saw the CDC stating: \u201cVaccine\u2013 a PRODUCT that stimulates a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a SPECIFIC DISEASE\u201d\u2014but in September-2021, after the definition was changed, saw the CDC stating; \u201cVaccine\u2013 a PREPARATION that is used to stimulate the body\u2019s immune response against DISEASES\u201d\u2014is a CDC definition change of vaccine designed to protect Covid jab makers, and when noticed by Republican Party leader US Congressman Thomas Massie, saw him posting the message: \u201cCheck out @CDCgov\u2019s evolving definition of \u201cvaccination\u201d\u2026They\u2019ve been busy at the Ministry of Truth\u201d.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members noting that the \u201cnewspaper of record\u201d leftist publication New York Times failed to inform its readers that CDC downgraded its definition of vaccine from \u201cprevent\u201d to \u201cimmunity\u201d to \u201cprevention\u201d to protect experimental Covid jab makers\u2014a failure to inform the New York Times was forced to do, otherwise its readers would rightly accuse the CDC of \u201cmedical quackery\u201d, a term that\u2019s branded on those who pretend, professionally or publicly, to have skill, knowledge, qualification or credentials they do not possess; otherwise called charlatans or snake oil salesman.\n\nAt the same time the New York Times is protecting the \u201cmedical quacks\u201d at the CDC, however, this report notes, it bears noticing that its famed columnist Ross Douthat just published in the New York Times his gobsmacking article \u201cHow I Became Extremely Open-Minded\u201d, wherein he describes his painful multi-year battle with Lyme Disease no medicine or prescribed treatment is able to cure\u2014a battle against this disease Douthat says drove him outside the boundaries of acceptable and approved modern medicine, and into the waiting arms of alternative medicine\u2014specifically a Rife Machine, that after using for the first time saw Douthat proclaiming: \u201cNaturally, it worked\u201d\u2014and in explaining why he\u2019s risking his career by telling a truth being kept hidden, saw Douthat stating: \u201cThere are two good reasons to share this sort of story. The first is that it\u2019s true, it really happened, and any testimony about what it\u2019s like to fight for your health for years would be dishonest if it left the weird stuff out...The second is that this kind of experience \u2014 not the Rife machine specifically, but the experience of falling through the solid floor of establishment consensus and discovering something bizarre and surprising underneath \u2014 is extremely commonplace...And the interaction between the beliefs instilled by these experiences and the skepticism they generate (understandably) from people who haven\u2019t had them, for whom the floor has been solid all their lives, is crucial to understanding cultural polarization in our time\u201d.\n\nInvented by the late American inventor and early exponent of high-magnification time-lapse cine-micrography Royal Raymond Rife, this report explains, the Rife Machine is a device that uses the resonance frequency of a pathogen to destroy it within the human body\u2014and as to why the Rife Machine isn\u2019t more popular, sees it being said:\n\nUnfortunately, research with the rife machine abruptly stopped when the American Medical Association (AMA) refused to publish any paper supporting the rife technology.\n\nIt\u2019s commonly thought that the AMA was directly responsible for the suppression of the rife device, which was considered \u201cnew medical technology.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in 1942 the Court of Appeals found the AMA guilty of suppressing new medical technologies in favor of drug companies.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that research with the rife machine resumed. In 1987, Barry Lynes wrote and published a book titled The Cancer Cure that Worked, which revived the subject in alternative therapy circles.\n\nToday, researchers are still experimenting with the rife machine.\n\nWhile there are no long-term studies on its effects, scientists have concluded that low rife frequency electromagnetic waves do affect tumors while leaving healthy cells untouched.\n\nWhile studies on its effectiveness are still being conducted, the rife machine has become a well-known alternative to traditional cancer therapies.\n\nIn April-2020, this report concludes, the United States Federal Trade Commission began sending out \u201cwarning letters\u201d to Rife Machine makers that had discovered and programmed into their devices the resonant frequency for the Covid virus, and stated: \u201cFor COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the product identified above...Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such product are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence\u201d\u2014US government \u201cwarning letters\u201d that were followed by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in India announcing it had found a way to cure the COVID-19 by using an extraordinary sound therapy using electro-frequency vibration, exactly like the Rife Machine does\u2014and is astonishing research joined with that conducted by Dr. Minghui Yao and Dr. Hongbo Wang at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Tiangong University in Tianjin-China, who in their critical to the world scientific paper being kept hidden from the American people titled \u201cA Potential Treatment For COVID-19 Based On Modal Characteristics And Dynamic Responses Analysis Of 2019-nCoV\u201d, revealed: \u201cThe 2019-nCoV is ravaging the world, taking lots of lives, and it is emergent to find a solution to deal with this novel pneumonia\u2026This paper provides a potential treatment for COVID-19 utilizing resonance to destroy the infection ability of 2019-nCoV\u201d.
