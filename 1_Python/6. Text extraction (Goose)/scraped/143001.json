It\u2019s pretty tough.\n\nA lot of systemic inequality has been exposed as the realities of the pandemic response set in. It\u2019s easier for some people to deal with the crisis than others. So it was great to see the Government step up and deliver a financial assistance package yesterday that had people\u2019s wellbeing at its heart. This is a good first step and we look forward to seeing more support measures rolled out over the coming weeks.\n\nFor example, not everyone has paid sick leave and many \u2018gig economy\u2019 workers don\u2019t have the option to work from home. Consider that if schools and child care spaces close for extended periods, the burden on working parents (especially low-income, single-parent or single-earner households) without flexible work conditions will be extra heavy. People without adequate homes are particularly vulnerable, as are those who have pre-existing health conditions.\n\nFear of a recession, along with the impact of the OPEC dispute that has oil prices tumbling, have also sparked calls on governments not to fund a bail out of the fossil fuel industry.\n\nAs Dame Anne Salmond points out, the coronavirus pandemic will test our values as a society:\n\n\u201cIn New Zealand, will we show aroha, and look out for each other, or will we sacrifice others for personal gain? Will we put the interests of the economy first, or the wider community? Will our leaders rise to the challenge, or play political games?\n\nOver the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen all of this \u2013 panic-buying and hoarding, but also care and compassion, both at home and across the Pacific. We\u2019ve witnessed dedicated leadership, but also petty point-scoring and opportunistic interventions.\n\nOn Monday, for instance, the president of Federated Farmers used a national crisis to try and stop long-awaited action to tackle climate change and clean up lakes, streams and rivers from going ahead. This had little to do with Covid-19; indeed, restoring biodiversity and waterways could provide work for people in industries such as tourism and forestry who have lost their jobs.\u201c\n\nGreenpeace, along with many others are calling for any spending to help build a better society, based on better health care, employment standards, social protections and a Green Stimulus Package\u2014 in short, a society where we truly take care of one another and the only planet Earth we\u2019ve got. And an economy and society transformed to make us more resilient, driving changes in the ways we live, work and get around that promote positive environmental and health outcomes.\n\nWe need systemic solutions to these kinds of protection gaps and problems. In the meantime, we can keep our community connections strong and model the behaviour we want our leaders to adopt and show them that love and compassion are stronger than fear.\n\nHere are eleven ways people are talking about caring for one another while staying safe as our family, friends, colleagues and neighbours navigate COVID-19.\n\n#1) Look after yourself, to look after us all \u2013 flatten the curve!\n\nUse simple social distancing tactics like replacing hugs and handshakes with alternatives \u2026\n\nIf we all do our best to stop the spread, we can flatten the curve!\n\n\n\nAlthough necessary, social isolation can be lonely.\n\nText, phone call, email or, if needed, in person (taking the proper safety measures), especially if they live alone.\n\n#3) Reach out to people in self isolation\n\nSend them funny memes or GIFs to cheer them up. Call them. Video chat them. Don\u2019t forget about them. Make sure they feel less alone and have social support. Offer them help. Some communities have started to use these cards to help neighbours who are in self-isolation.\n\nRight click and save these images to print and use:\n\nKnow someone in self isolation or who needs to limit their public interactions? Offer to pick up and deliver their shopping, treats or other things they might need, while taking precautions to keep yourself safe. Your time and labour could be a big help to someone needing support.\n\nDiseases can make anyone sick regardless of their origin or ethnicity. Yet because the virus originated in China, people of Chinese descent have faced a wave of racism. Help stop the fear and abuse by educating people and correcting racist comments or behaviour when you hear or see them.\n\nUnfortunately, if not unexpected, misinformation on COVID-19 is floating around online. If you see it, report it to your platform and let anyone posting/sharing it know (e.g., via private message or commenting on the post). Get your information from trusted sources like the World Health Organization, New Zealand Ministry for Health, or your doctor/hospital.\n\nIf you\u2019re a landlord and have the extra income, you could consider (as some landlords reportedly have) freezing rent payments and ensuring no evictions occur for any tenants struggling financially due to the pandemic. What do you think?\n\nFundraising platforms like Give A Little can help you organise, but word of mouth, email and text are also tried and true ways to do some grassroots fundraising in support of someone affected by things like missing work, paying for childcare because of school closures, or extra medical costs.\n\nSocial distancing doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t feel close to our loved ones. Get creative. Have a video chat to get together and celebrate birthdays or other occasions using everyday tools like Skype, Hangouts or Zoom. Or, synchronise watching your favourite TV show or movie together while chatting via text or video.\n\n#10) Share positive news and acts of kindness with your community\n\nThere are so many examples out there of people helping one another. Share those. Talk about those. Together we can prevent getting caught in a bad news hopelessness spiral. Spread the word about how you\u2019re making a difference.\n\n#11) And for cripe\u2019s sake stop buying up all the toilet paper!\n\nPrepare for what your household will need if quarantined, but curb the panic-greed reflex. If we want a better world, we have to learn to keep our community\u2019s needs top of mind and share the simple things (seriously, toilet paper?! Soap is shareable and, erm, Indispensable in a time like this!).\n\nAnd remember, wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. It protects you and everyone around you. It only takes 20 seconds.\n\n\n\nNick Young is Head of Communications at Greenpeace Aotearoa", "opengraph": {"title": "11 simple ways to care for each other during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic - Greenpeace International", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/29371/11-simple-ways-to-care-for-each-other-during-the-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic", "description": "Get the COVID-19 coronavirus facts, look after each other and stay safe!
