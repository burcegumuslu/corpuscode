Any other answer you could produce, would be wrong.\n\nThere is a common link between all these athletes and it is not that they are all fabulously wealthy, it is that they all received the experimental gene therapy that has been pushed by governments around the world since the beginning of 2021.\n\nOne America News journalist Pearson Sharp reported that 15 vaccinated tennis players have been forced to drop out of the Miami Open because of cardiac issues.\n\nPaula Badosa of Spain and Jannik Sinner of Italy \u2013 both crowd favorites \u2013 were two of those 15 athletes who had no choice but to quit.\n\nBadosa had to leave the tennis court at one stage because she started experiencing chest pains and Sinner just bent up in pain, also suffering chest pains.\n\nSharp remarked, \u201cThese are just two of more than 769 athletes who have collapsed during a game, on the field, over the last year,\u201d adding, \u201cNearly 800 athletes \u2013 young, fit people in the prime of life \u2013 falling down on the field. In fact, 500 percent more soccer players in the [European Union] are dropping dead from heart attacks than just one year ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many 23-year-old athletes were collapsing and suffering heart attacks before this year? Do you know any 23-year-old people who had heart attacks before now? These are just the ones we know about; how many have gone unreported?\u201d\n\nSharp also reported on the link between these athletes being the Pfizer shot and stated that, \u201cIn fact, many doctors treating these players list their injuries and deaths as being directly caused by the vaccine,\u201d said Sharp.\n\nChest pain and cardiac problems being only two of the adverse side effects that one can experience after taking the vaccine and the more shots you have taken, the more likely it becomes that you could experience a cardiac event.\n\nFormer sports commentator and retired British soccer star, Matt Le Tissier, expressed his concerns at all the sudden deaths occurring.\n\n\u201cI played for 17 years, [and] I don\u2019t think I saw one person in 17 years have to come off the football pitch with breathing difficulties [and] heart problems,\u201d he told Red Voice Media in an interview.\n\n\u201cThe last year, it\u2019s just been unbelievable how many people \u2026 are just keeling over. And at some point, surely you have to say \u2018This isn\u2019t right, this needs to be investigated.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrench tennis player Jeremy Chardy suffered a severe adverse reaction to the Pfizer vaccine in September 2021 \u2013 about a month after he had announced his intent to get injected with it.\n\n\u201cSince I got my vaccine, I have a problem, I have a series of problems. As a result, I can\u2019t train [and] I can\u2019t play. I prefer to take more time to heal myself and be sure that, in the future, I won\u2019t have any problems,\u201d the 34-year-old Chardy told French sports newspaper L\u2019Equipe. \u201cAt the moment, my season is stopped and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll start again. So now, I regret having taken the vaccine \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t have known. It\u2019s the first time that the idea that [the] next [tennis] season might be my last has crossed my mind.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Athletes Are Dropping Dead for No Apparent Reason - Liberty Planet", "description": "There has been a strange phenomenon happening over the past year or so that should cause you at least a small amount of concern, and that would be the number of athletes that are falling dead for no apparent reason, despite being in peak physical condition.
