I wonder what public benefit there is of hiding this data. Why doesn\u2019t anyone want to see it?\n\n\n\n The US Medicare data (which the CDC hides from view) shows that the flu vaccine causes more than 1 death per million vaccinated making it too unsafe to be used.\n\nThe evidence has been in plain sight but nobody seems to care.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not a doctor and doctors don\u2019t have any problem at all with their government hiding safety data. Have you ever seen any of them complain about the lack of transparency? Of course not! None of them want their licenses revoked or their grants canceled.\n\nHowever, since I\u2019m not a doctor, I\u2019m not encumbered.\n\nSo I wanted to let you in on a little secret: the government hides the data from us because the vaccines they\u2019ve been promoting are unsafe.\n\nLet\u2019s take the flu vaccine for example.\n\nHave you noticed that the government NEVER shows you the data from Medicare, VSD, BEST, or any other database?\n\nThe record level data we need to make a proper safety assessment is simply never made publicly available.\n\nThe reason is simple: the shots are deadly and should be pulled. If they released the data, everyone would know this. So they keep the data hidden from public view.\n\nThanks to an anonymous HHS employee, I\u2019ve been provided with the \u201cdays after death\u201d for the flu vaccine.\n\nI\u2019ve already published the flu charts twice before (here and here) and nobody noticed, even though I pointed it out in my Feb 25 Game Over article, so I\u2019m going to point it out once again now\n\nSee the spike on Day 0?\n\nAt least 375 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d on Day 0!\n\nLast I checked, there is no need to vaccinate people for the flu right before they die because the vaccine takes time to have an effect. That\u2019s why there is normally a reduced number of deaths on Day 0 vs. baseline: if you are about to die, they aren\u2019t going to waste time vaccinating you.\n\nBut you can see there are a375 excess deaths on Day 0.\n\nNow consider that this is a subset of all the people who get the flu vaccine in 2021:\n\u2022 It\u2019s only people who got the flu shot in Q1 of 2021\n\n375 excess deaths times 1M is more than the population of the US.\n\nSo over 1 person per million died.\n\nThis is above the safety threshold of a vaccine articulated by vaccine expert Paul Offit.\n\nThis means the flu vaccine should be pulled from the market.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I can make it any clearer than that.\n\nAnd the COVID vaccine? Well, it\u2019s killing people at a 1,000X greater rate than the flu shot. It should have been pulled long ago. Check out this analysis by Denis Rancourt that, after accumulating 100K views, was pulled from ResearchGate. It\u2019s a quality analysis. For example, one of my colleagues who NEVER texts me on ANY papers, texted me to look at this one: \u201cJust published. This data is really stunning.\u201d\n\nBut the health authorities are looking the other way and the doctors just blindly do whatever the CDC says, no matter how many people are killed.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - The Flu Vaccine is Too Deadly to be Used and Should be Pulled From the Market", "description": "The Flu Vaccine is Too Deadly to be Used and Should be Pulled From the Market By Steve Kirsch The Medicare data that the CDC never shows the public makes this crystal clear.
