One views the glass as half empty, and the other sees it as half full. We, of course, look at the brighter side of everything, wanting to make the world a more joyful place. So, here are the best pieces of news we heard in 2022, which warmed our hearts and made us smile.\n\n1. Scientists found a way to break down \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d\n\nThings like pesticides, among other manmade objects, contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, or forever chemicals, given that they are nearly impossible to break down in nature. But now, scientists have found a way to break these chemicals down using nothing more than water, a soap ingredient, and a common solvent.\n\nA team of scientists might have cured a woman of HIV using stem cell transplant technology. Not only that, but scientists believe this treatment could help an expanding pool of people in the future. HIV vaccine trials also continue, showing that there may be a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n5. Plastic bags may soon be recycled.\n\nOne-third of the world\u2019s plastics, like the ones used in plastic bags and shampoo bottles, are considered unrecyclable. But now, they might just get a new lease on life, given that scientists at the University of Berkeley have found a new way to recycle them.\n\n6. Sales of gas-powered cars are in permanent decline.\n\nAfter the sales of gasoline/diesel-powered vehicles (ICEVs) peaked in 2017, they have since been in decline, given that the progress of electric vehicles (EVs) has been faster than the world could predict. While getting clean electricity is also a major goal, as EVs increase on roads, emissions will naturally go down.\n\n7. Single-use plastics are being phased out, globally.\n\nSingle-use plastic is being banned by governments all around the world. In some places, the ban is already in effect, in others, it\u2019s in progress. Since most of these plastic items, like straws, earbud sticks, and more, are not recycled, banning them ensures less waste and pollution.\n\n8. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer teams will now be paid equally.\n\n9. A blood marker in babies who are at higher risk for SIDS has been identified.\n\n10. New solar panels can generate electricity at night too.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University have developed a new kind of solar cell, one that can generate some amount of electricity at night as well. While it may not make the same amount as solar cells do when the sun is up, this simply shows how solar energy is at the precipice of bigger things.\n\n11. Just 2 minutes of walking after eating can help your blood sugar.\n\nIf you want to stave off diabetes and level-out your blood sugar levels, walking for 2-5 minutes after a meal goes a long way, as does any kind of moderate activity. It\u2019s also good to break your sitting time as much as possible \u2014 walking for 2-5 minutes after every 20-30 minutes of sitting improves cardiovascular health.\n\n14. Miss Universe allows married women and mothers to compete.", "opengraph": {"description": "As\u00a0we\u00a0know, there are 2\u00a0kinds of\u00a0thought processes in\u00a0the world.
