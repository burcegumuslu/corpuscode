Posted in Latest news, Videos\n\nClimate Depot founder Marc Morano and Fox News host Dan Bongino slammed U.S. climate czar John Kerry\u2019s \u201csuicidal, climate change, global warming rollout\u201d on Saturday after he boasted to world leaders that his climate scheme would be similar to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe modeled it somewhat on the experience of what happened with vaccines,\u201d Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Change John Kerry proclaimed at the COP27 climate conference in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, in a presentation about the \u201cglobal climate crisis.\u201d\n\nMorano, who authored the 2022 book The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown, blasted Kerry\u2019s climate plan as a thin cover for \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d by using the \u201cCOVID template to fight climate.\u201d [emphasis, links added]\n\nWhat a \u201cCOVID template\u201d really means is that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t have a say\u201d in climate policy, Morano explained. \u201cDemocracy goes to die when they talk like that,\u201d Morano said in the Nov. 12 edition of Unfiltered. \u201cThis is all about control,\u201d he added.\n\nBongino went on to lambaste Kerry\u2019s eco-fanaticism.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with science,\u201d Bongino said. \u201cWhen the vax started to lose effectiveness against transmission, they almost doubled down on mandates. Their push for digital ID, digital currencies, you know, CO2 monitors \u2013 this is just a totalitarian way to control people. This has nothing to do with climate science.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking friendly corporations a bunch of money, mandating people to do stuff, crony capitalism,\u201d Bongino said, summing up Kerry\u2019s climate vision. \u201cSounds to me like The Great Reset.\u201d [Emphasis added].\n\nThe Great Reset is a totalitarian set of policies endorsed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) that advocates for a \u201cCommonPass\u201d vaccine tracking system, woke environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds, and a greater focus on \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nBut similar to the disastrous government policies enacted during the heyday of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 online schooling, forced vaccinations, and social distancing \u2014 the people in charge refuse to take responsibility for any of them, whether it\u2019s COVID-19 or climate change.\n\nAs Morano said: It\u2019s almost like saying that \u201c\u2018socialism never failed; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in the Soviet Union; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in Venezuela; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in Eastern Europe; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in Cuba.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if \u201call the failure we see everywhere\u201d in the wake of destructive climate change policies \u201cis more of a reason to double down,\u201d Morano said.\n\nMorano ripped the World Health Organization for reportedly trying to fuse COVID-19 and climate fear into a hybrid issue: \u201cThe World Health Organization was also here to morph COVID and climate together, by declaring climate a massive public health threat.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s despite the fact that, as Morano criticized, \u201cclimate-related deaths have dropped ninety-nine percent in the last hundred years, and they\u2019ve declined due to wealth creation, and development, infrastructure, and fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore also attended COP27 to push for a \u201cclimate trace app\u201d that will track \u201call individual CO2 contributors globally.\u201d But \u201cremember,\u201d Morano added, \u201cHumans inhale oxygen. We exhale CO2.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "John Kerry Slammed For Vowing To Use 'Covid Template' To Fight Climate Change", "description": "Critics are
