Martin, MD wrote in a 1986 article on his research in the Journal of Virology.\n\nMalcolm A. Martin et al. (Aug. 01, 1986). Production of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome-Associated Retrovirus in Human and Nonhuman Cells Transfected with an Infectious Molecular Clone, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 284-291.

Among other things, this means that their viruses can be introduced through food. He\u2019s celebrating that he found the human cells that are most susceptible to viruses like Coronavirus. This is a virus to assure your death.\n\nS. Prt. 104-NN. (Nov. 04, 1996). Plum Book, Policy and Supporting Positions. Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.

GPO.\n\nThere is an evident FRAUD in the 2000 Plum Book regarding Anthony Fauci\u2019s position.\n\nAn evident SES Deception as the administration transitions to George Bush\n\nAccording to the 1996 Plum Book, there was no \u201cDeputy Director, National\u201d INCUMBENT.\n\nThe only incumbent in that Institute was Anthony Fauci.\n\nS. Prt. 106-54. (Nov. 08, 2000). Plum Book, Policy and Supporting Positions. Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. U.S. Senate, 106th Congress, 2d Session, PDF p. 127.

The last previously identified person in the Plum Books was Anthony Fauci in the 1996 Plum Book.\n\nThis shell game is evident. Fauci\u2019s actual positions are shrouded in shifts of lower positions not previously disclosed, then the director position pops back up in 2008, then passes away or is vacant after that.\n\nThis is certainly suspicious Merry-go-Round executive priority setting by the SES at the NIH in the run up to this alleged pandemic.\n\nS.

He\u2019s tied with all The Pirbright Institute (UK) Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation money that funded the Coronavirus patent.\n\nGiven the weaponized Coronavirus upon us, Martin\u2019s expertise is quite telling.\n\nMalcolm A. Martin, M.D. (Accessed Mar. 18, 2020). Biography et al. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nMartin\u2019s research gets major funding from the largest contributors to The Pirbright Institute, patent holder of the CORONAVIRUS: Wellcome Trust (The Pirbright Institute UK, DARPA, WHO) and Bill Gates.\n\nSee Caltech snippet showing Martin and NIH receive funds from Gates and Wellcome, funders of The Pirbright Institute coronavirus patent holder U.S. Patent. No. 10,130,701\n\nSES Martin was literally the EDITOR on a Virology fundamentals textbook.\n\nMalcolm A. Martin et al. (Aug. 01, 1986).

The word transfection is a portmanteau of trans- and infection.\n\nFor our community of researchers: We will be adding to this post with some other findings, but needed to get this portion out to researchers ASAP.\n\nHere\u2019s what Betsy and Thomas had to say about the situation as of March 18, 2020.\n\nTreason: Who Terrorized Americans and the World on 9-11?", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Dr. Anthony Fauci Wants to Exterminate Your Family by Transfection", "url": "https://aim4truth.org/2020/03/18/dr-fauci-wants-to-kill-your-family/", "description": "Did Anthony Fauci help build Coronavirus with his NIH surrogate Malcolm Martin with Wellcome Trust (Pirbright Institute UK, QinetiQ, WHO, DARPA) and Gate Foundation funding?
