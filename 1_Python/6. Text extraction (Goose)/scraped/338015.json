For concerned parents seeking the truth, it\u2019s worth remembering that the exact same people who own the world\u2019s drug companies also own America\u2019s news outlets. Finding propaganda-free information has been difficult, until now.\n\nAt the center of the fifteen-year controversy is Dr. Andrew Wakefield of Austin, Texas. It was Dr. Wakefield that first publicized the link between stomach disorders and autism, and taking the findings one step further, the link between stomach disorders, autism and the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nFor that discovery way back in 1996, and a subsequent research paper published by the doctor in 1998, Andrew Wakefield has found himself the victim of a world-wide smear campaign by drug corporations, governments and media companies. And while Dr. Wakefield has been persecuted and prosecuted to the extent of being unable to legally practice medicine because of his discovery, he has instead become a best-selling author, the founder of the Strategic Autism Initiative, and the Director of the Autism Media Channel.\n\nBut in recent months, courts, governments and vaccine manufacturers have quietly conceded the fact that the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine most likely does cause autism and stomach diseases. Pharmaceutical companies have even gone so far as to pay out massive monetary awards, totaling in the millions, to the victims in an attempt to compensate them for damages and to buy their silence.\n\nIt was a regular reader named Kathleen that brought this ongoing story to our attention here at Whiteout Press. When asked what her connection to the vaccine-autism battle was, the young reader replied, \u201cI just researched it for a school project a while back and then I stayed on top of it, until I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I\u2019m not a parent, nor do I belong to any organization \u2013 a mere outside observer.\u201d\n\nThis reader isn\u2019t alone. The news that vaccines cause autism has spread across the US despite a coordinated media black-out. She takes her concerns one step further explaining, \u201cAll I want is to see this information where the public can access it. I\u2019ve looked everywhere, and no one gives this dire Wakefield situation even ONE small mention.\u201d She goes on to give us another motivation for her activism, \u201cIn Washington State, where I\u2019m from, vaccines have become mandatory for school children, which is very frightening!\u201d\n\nIn December 2012, two landmark decisions were announced that confirmed Dr. Wakefield\u2019s original concern that there is a link between the MMR vaccine, autism and stomach disorders. The news went mostly unreported, but independent outlets like The Liberty Beacon finally began publishing the groundbreaking news.\n\nThe website wrote last month, \u2018In a recently published December 13, 2012 vaccine court ruling, hundreds of thousands of dollars were awarded to Ryan Mojabi, whose parents described how \u201cMMR vaccinations\u201d caused a \u201csevere and debilitating injury to his brain, diagnosed as Autism Spectrum Disorder (\u2018ASD\u2019).\u201d\u2019\n\nThe Liberty Beacon went on to describe the second court ruling that month, as well as similar previous verdicts writing, \u2018Later the same month, the government suffered a second major defeat when young Emily Moller from Houston won compensation following vaccine-related brain injury that, once again, involved MMR and resulted in autism. The cases follow similar successful petitions in the Italian and US courts (including Hannah Poling, Bailey Banks, Misty Hyatt, Kienan Freeman, Valentino Bocca, and Julia Grimes) in which the governments conceded or the court ruled that vaccines had caused brain injury. In turn, this injury led to an ASD diagnosis. MMR vaccine was the common denominator in these cases.\u2019\n\nThe report echoes the exact same sentiment that our reader conveyed \u2013 Dr. Wakefield has had his career and reputation destroyed over the past 15 years, but has just been vindicated. The account reports, \u2018While repeated studies from around the world confirmed Wakefield\u2019s bowel disease in autistic children and his position that safety studies of the MMR are inadequate, Dr. Wakefield \u2019s career has been destroyed by false allegations. Despite this he continues to work tirelessly to help solve the autism catastrophe.\u2019\n\nThe article from The Liberty Beacon closes with a direct quote from Dr. Wakefield himself to the independent grassroots outlet, \u201cThere can be very little doubt that vaccines can and do cause autism. In these children, the evidence for an adverse reaction involving brain injury following the MMR that progresses to an autism diagnosis is compelling. It\u2019s now a question of the body count. The parents\u2019 story was right all along. Governments must stop playing with words while children continue to be damaged. My hope is that recognition of the intestinal disease in these children will lead to the relief of their suffering. This is long, long overdue.\u201d\n\nSince the world has slowly become aware of the dangers of the MMR vaccine, parents around the globe have refused to get their children vaccinated. Earlier this year, the UK government singled out Dr. Wakefield and blamed him for the rising number of measles outbreaks in the country. In an April 2013 interview, he responded publicly.\n\nThe website TheRefusers.com published both the video, as well as the written transcript, of Dr. Wakefield\u2019s public response. Below are some excerpts of the doctor\u2019s remarks:\n\n\u201cThe important thing to say is that back in 1996-1997 I was made aware of children developing autism, regressive autism, following exposure in many cases to the measles mumps rubella vaccine. Such was my concern about the safety of that vaccine that I went back and reviewed every safety study, every pre-licensing study of the MMR vaccine and other measles-containing vaccines before they were put into children and after. And I was appalled with the quality of that science. It really was totally below par and that has been reiterated by other authoritative sources since.\n\nAll I could do as a parent was to say, \u2018what would I do for my child?\u2019 That was the only honest answer I could give. My position on that has not changed. So, what happened subsequently? At that time the single measles vaccines were available freely on the National Health Service. Otherwise, I would not have suggested that option. So parents, if they were legitimately concerned about the safety of MMR could go and get the single vaccines. Six months later, the British government unilaterally withdrew the importation license for the single vaccines, therefore depriving parents of having these on the NHS; depriving parents who had legitimate concerns about the safety of MMR from a choice; denying them the opportunity to protect their children in the way that they saw fit.\n\nThe news shouldn\u2019t be left wing or right wing, conservative or liberal. It should be the news. It should be independent \u2013 Whiteout Press\n\nAnd I was astonished by this and I said to Dr Elizabeth Miller of the Health Protection Agency, \u2018why would you do this, if your principal concern is to protect children from serious infectious disease? Why would you remove an option from parents who are legitimately concerned about the safety of MMR?\u2019 And her answer was extraordinary. She said to me, \u2018if we allow parents the option of single vaccines, it would destroy our MMR program.\u2019 In other words, her principal concern seemed to be full protection of the MMR program and not protection of children.\u201d\n\nDr. Wakefield himself reiterates the final conclusion of the courts in various countries, but censored by the world\u2019s media outlets saying:\n\n\u201cNow this question has been answered not by me, but by the courts, by the vaccine courts in Italy and in the United States of America where it appears that many children over the last thirty years have been awarded millions of dollars for the fact that they have been brain-damaged by MMR vaccine and other vaccines and that brain damage has led to autism. That is a fact.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Courts quietly confirm MMR Vaccine causes Autism | We Are Change", "description": "By Mark Wachtler, whiteoutpress.com After decades of passionate debate, parents probably missed the repeated admissions by drug companies and governments", "url": "https://wearechange.org/courts-quietly-confirm-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2016-01-15T16:53:32+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2016-04-05T14:32:37+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Syringe_with_Green_Fluid-300x225.jpg", "image:width": "300", "image:height": "225", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.trueactivist.com/courts-quietly-confirm-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism#at_pco=tst-1.0&at_si=5696829fcfe1b463&at_ab=per-2&at_pos=0&at_tot=2", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Phillips"], "publish_date": "2016-01-15T16:53:32+00:00"}
