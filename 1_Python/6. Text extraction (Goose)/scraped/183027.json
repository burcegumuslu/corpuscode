With a leaflet, \"Alexander Hamilton's Credit Principle,\" LaRouche's movement will hit Wall Street and New York again this week to follow through on the Jan. 17 breakout event in New York, \"BRICS Nations Revive Dr. Martin Luther King's Dream.\"\n\nBut because of the bankruptcy of Wall Street and the City of London, they continue to drive for war against Russia and China: provocations against Russia in Eastern Europe, war again raging in Ukraine, sanctions and financial warfare overtly aimed at bringing down the Putin government.\n\nEIR Founding Editor LaRouche had a firm message on this today, which must be understood.\n\n\"If the United States launches attacks on Russia,\" LaRouche said, \"then Russian weapons will hit the United States before it knows what has happened. If you represent Wall Street, if you participate in its policies, then you're already dead if the United States goes to war with Russia.\"\n\nThe Wall Street and London banks are reeling, showing all signs of another oncoming, well-deserved breakdown. The Wall Street megabanks are on the hook for the \"shale oil bubble\" now undergoing collapse, and exposed to it by $20 trillion in derivatives contracts now going bad. They've just reported their worst earnings since the Great Depression and laid off 50,000 employees. The European megabanks, under City of London's dictate, are so bankrupt they are desperate to get a $1-2 trillion bailout from the European Central Bank started this week; and were just shocked by big losses when Switzerland cut its ties with the sinking euro currency. As one Wall Street Journal writer expressed it Monday,\n\n\"the Davos conference is opening with the world on the edge of a nervous breakdown.\"\n\nThat is, the world of Wall Street.\n\nIt is this desperate City of London/Wall Street regime which threatens war \u2014 even global thermonuclear war \u2014 thinking to save itself by the capitulation of just those nations whose policies threaten it with a new order: China and Russia in particular; the BRICS-allied nations generally.\n\nLaRouche's warning is directed precisely at that insane delusion of a collapsing Wall Street order.\n\nThe Schiller Institute's petition calling for the United States and Europe to join with the BRICS nations, is crucial in this situation.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "page URL https://larouchepac.com/20150120", "title": "A Warning On Wall Street's Insane War Against Russia", "description": "The Wall Street and London banks are reeling, showing all signs of another oncoming, well-deserved breakdown.
