Odd vote out shows the dilemma\u2019 in which Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, cautions that vaccines don\u2019t work as well on the frail and elderly compared to healthy people. \u201cWhen shots begin to go into arms of residents, Moore said Americans need to understand that deaths may occur that won\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine,\u201d states the report. \u201cWe would not at all be surprised to see, coincidentally, vaccination happening and then having someone pass away a short time after they receive a vaccine, not because it has anything to do with the vaccination but just because that\u2019s the place where people at the end of their lives reside,\u201d Moore said. She then said Americans shouldn\u2019t be alarmed to see people dying a day or two after receiving the COVID vaccination. \u201cOne of the things we want to make sure people understand is that they should not be unnecessarily alarmed if there are reports, once we start vaccinating, of someone or multiple people dying within a day or two of their vaccination who are residents of a long-term care facility. That would be something we would expect, as a normal occurrence, because people die frequently in nursing homes.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["News", "Headline"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://medicalkidnap.com/2020/12/10/cnn-dont-be-alarmed-if-people-start-dying-after-taking-the-vaccine/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
