Hassett on . Posted in Latest news\n\nThe recent European riots in response to COVID shutdowns reminded us that pandemic disruptions are far from being behind us, especially now with the Omicron variant among us.\n\nDespite having two vaccinations and a booster shot, I still find myself wearing a mask whenever I visit an indoor space. I dutifully wear the mask when entering a restaurant and then take it off after sitting down to eat a few feet away.\n\nHow it could help anyone to force me to mask up when I am standing a foot from my table is beyond me, but I comply because I don\u2019t want to cause a scene.\n\nIt seems unbelievable that this virus could continue interfering with our lives in such a Kafkaesque fashion nearly a year after vaccinations began.\n\nIf it\u2019s a pandemic of the unvaccinated, then should my virtuous self be allowed to go about my business without a mask?\n\nIf the vaccine is so effective, with hospitalization probabilities near zero for people in my age group who are vaccinated, then how can it be that the scolds continue to hold so much power over me?\n\nThe answer of course is that the section of our ruling class (a notion that, broadly defined, expands far beyond our legislatures) that wants to take away our freedoms and control our lives found, in Tony Fauci, the perfect device for mass oppression.\n\nShut things down, smother people\u2019s faces with masks, make grandparents die alone \u2014 all in the name of science. Of course, a power grab in the name of science is something that the Left has been attempting for years in the name of climate change.\n\nThe similarities between the apocalyptic rhetoric about COVID and that about climate change, often spouted by the same people, should not evade the attention of conservatives.\n\nAs terrible as the virus has been, nobody has claimed that it will destroy the earth as we know it. The same cannot be said for the climate.\n\nI do not intend to dispute anything about climate science in this space, but it is striking how extreme the statements of mainstream progressive politicians have been about the consequences of doing nothing on climate.\n\nIn 2009, for example, Al Gore told us, \u201cSome of the models suggest to Dr. (Wieslav) Maslowski that there is a 75 percent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years.\u201d\n\nSuch an eventuality, of course, would flood many of the world\u2019s population centers. If that were to happen, it would not be an exaggeration to state, as Gore did in his Nobel acceptance speech, that \u201cWe, the human species, are confronting a planetary emergency \u2014 a threat to the survival of our civilization that is gathering ominous and destructive potential even as we gather here.\u201d\n\nIn that speech, Gore went as far as to compare those who oppose his preferred policies to, yes, those who enabled Adolf Hitler.\n\n\u201cDespite a growing number of honorable exceptions,\u201d said the former vice president, \u201ctoo many of the world\u2019s leaders are still best described in the words Winston Churchill applied to those who ignored Adolf Hitler\u2019s threat: \u2018They go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf you do not agree with the Left\u2019s policy actions, you are analogous to the enablers of a mass murderer. And the alarmism does not stop with Gore.\n\nLook at Joe Biden\u2019s recent talk in Glasgow: \u201cClimate change is already ravaging the world. We\u2019ve heard from many speakers. It\u2019s not a hypothetical; it\u2019s not a hypothetical threat. It\u2019s destroying people\u2019s lives and livelihoods and doing it every single day.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t wear a mask, you are killing people; folks will get in your face and bully you into submission. In the minds of these people, what should be done if you drive a car, or heat your house with oil, consume meat from a flatulent cow, or hop on an airplane?\n\nIf we can shut down the economy and force people to isolate [themselves] because of a virus that threatens a small percentage of humanity, what can we do when the entire Earth is threatened?\n\nMy fear is that the Left has found in the totalitarian Fauci state the playbook that takes this entire COVID farce to the next level.\n\nIf we can shut down everything, even churches, for 30 days to \u201cstop the spread,\u201d why not shut the entire economy down for half a year to save the planet?\n\nAnd between now and then, widespread public shaming of anyone who dares to contribute to climate change in any way seems as inevitable as the phases of the moon.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Death By 1,000 Climate Faucis", "description": "The government's pandemic power grab should make us more skeptical of climate policy.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2021-12-01T14:40:31+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fauci.jpg?fit=1847%2C1232&ssl=1", "image:width": "1847", "image:height": "1232", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-fail-arctic-sea-ice-growing-nearing-highest-extent-in-two-decades/", "https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1953/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/biden-tells-cop26-he-will-remake-american-economy-in-net-zeros-image/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/quarantines-lockdowns-no-impact-global-co2-levels/", "https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/12/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?utm_source=recirc-desktop&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=river&utm_content=more-in&utm_term=first", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Death%20By%201%2C000%20Climate%20Faucis&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fdeath-by-1000-climate-faucis%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/death-by-1000-climate-faucis/#print"], "authors": ["Thomas Richard"], "publish_date": "2021-12-01T14:40:31+00:00"}
