They dread re-adopting past norms and bristle at the re-opening that everyone else seems to embrace \u2013 this, in turn, creates feelings of guilt and/or confusion about life after the pandemic.\n\nDespite obvious pandemic drawbacks, there were benefits to staying and working from home with ADHD (for those who were able to) \u2014 most notably, relief from the pressures of everyday life. Many women with ADHD have experienced more than a year without the demands of executive function, coordination, logistics, and social pressures. And, for them, returning to life as it was before the pandemic is both terrifying and exhausting to even consider.\n\nSo as pandemic-related restrictions continue to lift, women with ADHD need transition strategies to begin to peek out and move forward. Here are some of my favorites.\n\nAfter the Pandemic: 4 Guiding Rules for Women with ADHD\n\n1. Be Gentle with Yourself\n\nA lot of women with ADHD feel guilty now, or they feel depressed and disappointed that they didn\u2019t accomplish all they thought they should have during the pandemic. We didn\u2019t go through all of our boxes and didn\u2019t clear out all our clutter. We didn\u2019t write the great American novel.\n\nFirst and foremost, women with ADHD need to understand that the pandemic was not a vacation and it was not a sabbatical. It was a trauma. As a result, our psyches have changed. Be gentle with yourself in this re-emergence process, and realize that we\u2019ve all collectively gone through something unprecedented. Millions of people have lost loved ones and/or had the disease themselves, suffering terrible losses.\n\n[Take This Self-Test: ADHD Symptoms in Women]\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of \u201cvaccine hesitancy?\u201d What about returning-to-normal-life hesitancy? Many women with ADHD feel that going back will be too much for them to handle because they devised creative (and now comfortable) ways of living with social distancing.\n\nI see women with ADHD who would never have thought of ordering groceries doing that now. They enjoyed not having to say \u201cno\u201d to things like dinner parties because there weren\u2019t any! They didn\u2019t have to worry about makeup, accessorizing, and getting dressed because friends weren\u2019t dropping in.\n\nThey didn\u2019t feel the pressure to go to the gym because gyms weren\u2019t open! A lot of people saved money because there was virtually no travel or entertainment to spend it on. They didn\u2019t have to go to doctors\u2019 appointments in person, thanks to telemedicine. They didn\u2019t have to schedule carpools. They didn\u2019t have to make small talk. Day-to-day, moment-to-moment demands were reduced for women with ADHD.\n\nBut now we\u2019re faced with giving that back up \u2013 and it won\u2019t be an easy transition. We\u2019ve spent a year learning to view people and places as dangerous, and it will take time to overcome that. In the meantime, say \u201cno\u201d more often, and practice setting boundaries that protect your mental and physical health.\n\n[Read: What If \u2018Back to Normal\u2019 Is Terrifying?]\n\n3. Dip Your Toe in the World\n\nThere won\u2019t be a big opening day when everything suddenly goes back to normal. We have to plan our first small steps.\n\nI encourage women with ADHD to ask themselves:\n\u2022 \u201cWhat new experiences have I discovered that I value during this time out that I want to continue when the pandemic is over?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhat have I discovered as a result of this time away from my pre-pandemic life that I want to discard or modify?\u201d\n\nAs for me, I discovered the river close by my home, and I now go there every day. I never did that before. I have groceries delivered now, and I may never go back to the grocery store. I discovered that I love being in nature. I started listening to classical music.\n\nThe answers to these questions can also influence your symptom management. I\u2019ve heard from many women that they were able to see firsthand the true challenges of their life with ADHD during the pandemic.\n\nStart to think about what might make you excited in life after the pandemic. Seeing a person you love? Visiting a certain place? What will help you take small steps toward your own new normal?\n\nI am personally motivated to become comfortable in public again. I want to do an internal inventory to discover which people are important enough to make me push a little further out of my comfort zone.\n\nSome people are not ready to go back their old lives. When you go through something difficult, make it count for something. Use this experience to think about who you are now.\n\nOnce you know what you want to discard and what you want to move toward, take that first step.\n\nAfter the Pandemic for Women with ADHD: Next Steps\n\u2022 Read: How Could This Pandemic Change Me for Good?\n\u2022 Read: Healthy Habits Forged in a Pandemic: The Lifestyle Changes We Will Keep\n\nSUPPORT ADDITUDE\n\n Thank you for reading ADDitude.
