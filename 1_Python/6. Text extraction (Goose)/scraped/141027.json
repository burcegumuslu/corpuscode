She cited Chris Pandolfo of Blaze Media, who revealed in March 2022 that his organization has filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to HHS. The requests, she said, sought to find out if the Biden administration was covertly funding corporate media to push the lethal Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines on the population.\n\nAccording to the independent journalist, Pandolfo found that almost all corporate media outlets took the money from the administration to push the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMajor news channels such as ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and fake news network CNN were named as recipients of the \u201cadvertising\u201d money from HHS. Legacy media publications \u2013 including the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post \u2013 were also named in response to the FOIA requests. Aside from national media outlets, local newspapers and TV stations received money to publish articles and air video segments regarding the vaccine\u2019s purported \u201cefficacy and safety.\u201d\n\nEven worse, the HHS also paid off so-called conservative media outlets such as Fox News and Newsmax to spin positive stories about deadly and ineffective vaccines to their \u201csuspicious\u201d conservative viewers.\n\nRobinson pointed out that the two conservative news outlets \u201ctook the money and said nothing to [their] conservative viewers,\u201d which was confirmed by a whistleblower from inside Newsmax who reached out to her. (Related: Revealed: Big Tech paid off \u201cconservative\u201d media outlets in an effort to wipe out criticism for CENSORING conservatives.)\n\nThe independent journalist added personal details to the scheme involving Newsmax\u2018s promotion of COVID-19 vaccines. Top executives of the outlet contacted Robinson and told her to stop any negative coverage of the vaccines in 2021, as they were \u201cproblematic.\u201d She received this warning multiple times, albeit worded differently in each instance.\n\nWhile the majority of corporate media employees kept their mouths closed, Robinson did not. She discussed the ban on negative vaccine coverage with other Newsmax producers and top anchors at the time. Both the producers and anchors she talked to expressed awareness of the fact that they could not provide negative coverage of the vaccines lest they suffer repercussions from the network.\n\nFurthermore, public relations experts who worked with Newsmax told Robinson that medical experts and doctors who might say negative things about the new vaccines would not be booked as guests at all.\n\nIn other words, the independent journalist pointed out that the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cadvertising\u201d money did not just pay for a pro-vaccine propaganda campaign at MSM outlets. It also paid for an outright ban on any sort of negative coverage on the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest and most comprehensive breach of journalistic ethics that has ever occurred. Almost all these media practitioners took the money, and everyone lied about the vaccines. Most of them also refused to report anything negative about the vaccines because they had been paid to close their eyes.\u201d\n\nCorporate news executives with no medical training and no expertise began making ludicrous announcements that were essentially blanket endorsements of deadly and untested vaccines. Some publications even featured advice from experts about how readers could convince vaccine-hesitant people in their lives to change their minds.\n\nMSM outlets have been justifying their bias to report only one side of the narrative because they believe they are doing no harm by reporting only one side of the story. From their point of view, everything looks OK \u2013 but at the expense of one side being suppressed.\n\n\u201cWe have just lived through the most extensive propaganda campaign in the history of the world,\u201d concluded Robinson. \u201cIt was paid for with taxpayer dollars. You \u2026 [and] I paid for it. We will probably never know how much money was spent.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below for more information about how mainstream media is handling the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis video is from the Red Pilled channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nExclusive: The federal government paid hundreds of media companies to advertise the COVID-19 vaccines while those same outlets provided positive coverage of the vaccines.\n\nELEPHANT in the ROOM: Five billion dollars paid out for vaccine-induced injuries in two decades, but nobody ever casts proper blame in mainstream media.\n\nNewspapers being paid by UK govt to publish \u2018news\u2019 on their positive COVID response.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2022-08-25 00:18:48", "title": "VACCINE PIMPS: Biden administration has been paying MSM to push COVID vaccines that are killing and injuring millions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2022-08-24-biden-administration-paying-msm-to-push-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "The Biden\u00a0administration \u2013 through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is paying mainstream media (MSM) companies to promote vaccines and suppress stories that could increase vaccine hesitancy.
