We all still get nervous, even if we\u2019ve done this before.\n\u2022 You don\u2019t need to have all the answers. If you are unsure of an answer, be honest. Tell the person asking that you are a volunteer, and you will take down their question so that a health department staff person can get them the correct answer.\n\u2022 Inform, don\u2019t convince. Your job is to equip the person at the door with the information/resources they need to make an informed decision about their health. You are not trying to convince anyone to do something they don\u2019t want to do.\n\u2022 Ignore no soliciting signs. You\u2019re not soliciting! You\u2019re offering critical information and resources. What you are doing is not illegal.\n\u2022 Knock and then back up [zh: so you don\u2019t get shot?]. Follow COVID-19 distancing protocols and speak clearly. If someone is uncomfortable with you being there in person, offer to give them more distance or leave them a flyer.\n\u2022 Use your script. This will give you the basics. Once you get comfortable with it, feel free to make it sound more like you as long as all the key information is there. Make clear up front that the building has let you in and you\u2019re from the health department.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, volunteers are told to keep a list of who\u2019s been naughty or nice.\n\u2022 Report on your work! Be sure to fill out the Doorknocking Spreadsheet with the counts of who still needs a vaccine, who is already vaccinated, who needs more info, etc . This is important information that the Health Department is relying on!\n\nThe door knockers are then given various scenarios in an attached script. For example:\n\nPM (property manager) /CAM (community association manager): We don\u2019t allow solicitation on our property. CHM (community health ambassador): I understand but I am not selling anything, we want to provide accurate information to the seniors in your community. Our goal is to maximize the vaccination effort so that ALL of your seniors receive the COVID vaccine when the clinic comes on-site. All I want is to see your seniors protected against COVID.\n\nSenior: I\u2019ve had allergic reactions to medications and foods years ago, is this vaccine safe for me? CHA: The only true contraindication to this vaccine is a severe (anaphylactic) reaction to an injectable/vaccine in your past [ZH: *cough* what?]. Or an allergy to an ingredient in the vaccine, like polysorbate. After your vaccination, they will observe you for 15 minutes to be sure you\u2019re doing well. With a history of other allergic reactions, they may want to watch you for a total of 30 minutes, instead of the standard 15 minutes, just to be sure you\u2019re feeling ok. But if you have any question about your past allergies and vaccine compatibility, you should ask your doctor/healthcare provider.\n\nApparently door knockers are already operating in various towns.\n\nAnd to nobody\u2019s surprise, concern is growing over the sudden surge in vaccine \u2018awareness\u2019 campaigns.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\"Ignore No Soliciting Signs, Use Your Script\": Vaccine Door-Knocking Documents Revealed", "description": "White House-coordinated FEMA \"surge teams\" are being assembled to reinforce local efforts on the ground.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/ignore-no-soliciting-signs-use-your-script-vaccine-door-knocking-documents-revealed/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-07-11T15:32:57+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AHJSKDHSAKJD-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BIDEN ADMINISTRATION VACCINE DOOR TO DOOR SALES PITCH SCRIPT <a href=\"https://t.co/yiMqrKIxiv\">pic.twitter.com/yiMqrKIxiv</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 The_Real_Fly (@The_Real_Fly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_Real_Fly/status/1413635305521963011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You don't have to be selling something to be soliciting. <a href=\"https://t.co/HaUaBq0pee\">pic.twitter.com/HaUaBq0pee</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 AJA4 (@j_aja4) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_aja4/status/1413722851283189762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/i1YTknsMtT\">pic.twitter.com/i1YTknsMtT</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 The_Real_Fly (@The_Real_Fly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_Real_Fly/status/1413635395506561029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">HEADS UP!
