The article detailed a paper published by a courageous doctor and investigative medical researcher, Lucija Tomljenovic, who dug up the dirt on 30 years of secret official transcripts of meetings of UK government vaccine committees and the supposedly independent medical \u201cexperts\u201d sitting on them with their drug industry connections.\n\nLucija Tomljenovic, PhD, is a research scientist with the Neural Dynamics Research Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Colombia, Canada. She has extensive experience investigating the safety of vaccine adjuvants.\n\nAs Food Freedom News\u2019 Andrew Baker noted in an article the following year, the secret official documents show that government experts have:\n\u2022 Known they cause the diseases they are supposed to prevent.\n\u2022 Known they are a hazard to children.\n\u2022 Colluded to lie to the public.\n\n\u201cThose are the same vaccines that are mandated to children in the US,\u201d Baker wrote.\n\nWe have republished Child Health Safety\u2019s article below.

Thank you to Lioness of Judah Ministry for bringing these valuable articles to attention.\n\n30 Years of Secret Official Transcripts Show UK Government Experts Cover Up Vaccine Hazards\n\n[ED: Readers should note that a paper presented at a scientific conference is a citable reference for publication purposes. That applies to Dr Lucija Tomljenovic\u2019s paper discussed in this article.]\n\nAn extraordinary new paper published by a courageous doctor and investigative medical researcher has dug the dirt on 30 years of secret official transcripts of meetings of UK government vaccine committees and the supposedly independent medical \u201cexperts\u201d sitting on them with their drug industry connections.\n\nIf you want to get an idea of who is responsible for your child\u2019s condition resulting from a vaccine adverse reaction then this is the paper to read. What you have to ask yourself is if the people on these committees are honest and honourable and acting in the best interests of British children, how is it this has been going on for at least 30 years?\n\nThis is what everyone has always known but could never prove before now. Pass this information on to others so they can see what goes on in Government health committees behind locked doors.\n\nWe quote here from the author\u2019s summary and the paper:\n\nThe 45-page paper with detailed evidence can be downloaded here: The vaccination policy and the Code of Practice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI): are they at odds? Lucija Tomljenovic, Neural Dynamics Research Group, Dept. of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. It was presented at and forms part of the proceedings of The 2011 BSEM Scientific Conference now published online here: The Health Hazards of Disease Prevention BSEM Scientific Conference, March 2011*.\n\n[ED: BSEM HAVE REORGANISED THEIR WEBSITE AND THIS PAGE NO LONGER EXISTS THERE \u2013 Note Added 8 May 2014]\n\nThere are other papers also found at that link which you will find an excellent read.\n\nHere I present the documentation which appears to show that the JCVI made continuous efforts to withhold critical data on severe adverse reactions and contraindications to vaccinations to both parents and health practitioners in order to reach overall vaccination rates which they deemed were necessary for \u201cherd immunity\u201d, a concept which with regards to vaccination, and contrary to prevalent beliefs, does not rest on solid scientific evidence as will be explained. As a result of such vaccination policy promoted by the JCVI and the DH, many children have been vaccinated without their parents being disclosed the critical information about demonstrated risks of serious adverse reactions, one that the JCVI appeared to have been fully aware of. It would also appear that, by withholding this information, the JCVI/DH neglected the right of individuals to make an informed consent concerning vaccination. By doing so, the JCVI/DH may have violated not only International Guidelines for Medical Ethics (i.e., Helsinki Declaration and the International Code of Medical Ethics) [2] but also, their own Code of Practice.\n\n[ED: THE UK DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH APPEARS TO HAVE CHANGED ALL THE LINKS TO THEIR DOCUMENTS BY ARCHIVING THEM WITH THE UK NATIONAL ARCHIVE \u2013 IF READERS WOULD LIKE TO ATTEMPT TO FIND THE CORRECT LINKS ON THE UK NATIONAL ARCHIVE AND POST THEM IN A COMMENT HERE THAT WOULD BE WELCOME \u2013 Note Added 9 May 2014]\n\nThe transcripts of the JCVI meetings also show that some of the Committee members had extensive ties to pharmaceutical companies and that the JCVI frequently co-operated with vaccine manufacturers on strategies aimed at boosting vaccine uptake. Some of the meetings at which such controversial items were discussed were not intended to be publicly available, as the transcripts were only released later, through the Freedom of Information Act (FOI). These particular meetings are denoted in the transcripts as \u201ccommercial in confidence\u201d, and reveal a clear and disturbing lack of transparency, as some of the information was removed from the text (i.e., the names of the participants) prior to transcript release under the FOI section at the JCVI website (for example, JCVI CSM/DH (Committee on the Safety of Medicines/Department of Health) Joint Committee on Adverse Reactions Minutes 1986-1992).\n\nIn summary, the transcripts of the JCVI/DH meetings from the period from 1983 to 2010 appear to show that:\n\u2022 Instead of reacting appropriately by re-examining existing vaccination policies when safety concerns over specific vaccines were identified by their own investigations, the JCVI either a) took no action, b) skewed or selectively removed unfavourable safety data from public reports and c) made intensive efforts to reassure both the public and the authorities in the safety of respective vaccines;\n\u2022 Significantly restricted contraindication to vaccination criteria in order to increase vaccination rates despite outstanding and unresolved safety issues;\n\u2022 On multiple occasions requested from vaccine manufacturers to make specific amendments to their data sheets, when these were in conflict with JCVI\u2019s official advices on immunisations;\n\u2022 Persistently relied on methodologically dubious studies, while dismissing independent research, to promote vaccine policies;\n\u2022 Promoted and elaborated a plan for introducing new vaccines of questionable efficacy and safety into the routine paediatric schedule, on the assumption that the licenses would eventually be granted;\n\u2022 Deliberately took advantage of parents\u2019 trust and lack of relevant knowledge on vaccinations in order to promote a scientifically unsupported immunisation program which could put certain children at risk of severe long-term neurological damage.\n\nNotably, all of these actions appear to violate the JCVI\u2019s own Code of Practice.\n\nRead the paper here for the full evidence to back up these conclusions in its 45 pages.

[ED: BSEM HAVE REORGANISED THEIR WEBSITE AND THIS PAGE NO LONGER EXISTS THERE \u2013 Note Added 8 May 2014]\n\n*Note from The Expos\u00e9 on the British society for Ecological Medicine (\u201cBSEM\u201d) Scientific Conference in March 2011\n\nThe below is extracted from the archive of BSEM which can be found HERE.\n\nThe BSEM Scientific Conference in March 2011 with this title was organised by Dr David Freed. We resolved to publish the proceedings online, and David worked with the speakers to put papers into an agreed and acceptable format, and wrote a personal introduction. The next day he died suddenly. What follows are the last words that he wrote. He speaks from the heart about science, about corruption in high places, about the ethics of patient care, and above all about truth.\n\nThe issue of vaccination and its risks arouse strong emotions, not least of fear \u2013 fear of public attack for speaking out, for one. These are the conference presentations that we are permitted to publish. Several booked speakers withdrew, for various reasons, so are not posted. Some speakers were unable to attend, but were keen for their papers to be included in the proceedings; they are posted here.\u201d", "opengraph": {"image": "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FSep21.png?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.vaccinechoiceprayercommunity.org/lucija-tomljenovic-phd.html", "https://archive.ph/A4pKe", "https://archive.ph/o/A4pKe/https:/web.archive.org/web/20130701115440/http:/childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/government-experts-cover-up-vaccine-hazards/", "https://lionessofjudah.substack.com/p/a-valuable-article-from-2013-the", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/nsnbc.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BSEM-2011.pdf", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/www.ecomed.org.uk/publications/the-health-hazards-of-disease-prevention", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@ab/documents/digitalasset/dh_115363.pdf", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/FreedomOfInformation/Freedomofinformationpublicationschemefeedback/FOIreleases/DH_4135306", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@ab/documents/digitalasset/%20dh_115363.pdf", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/nsnbc.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BSEM-2011.pdf", "https://archive.ph/o/r2YQ9/www.ecomed.org.uk/publications/the-health-hazards-of-disease-prevention", "https://sanevax.org/british-society-for-ecollogical-medicine-the-health-hazards-of-disease-prevention/", "https://www.scribd.com/document/236151178/VACCINATION-DANGERS-The-Health-Hazards-of-Disease-Prevention-BSEM-2011"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
