Among these vaccines we find the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria\u201d Cuadernos De Bioetica 2008 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18611078/\n\n\u201cThese scientific and medical advances are dependent on the use of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses. While the practice of induced abortion despite societal benefit may be theologically objectionable to some, these practices are professionally responsible. Federal regulations exist to discourage patients from being influenced by the societal benefit of fetal research in arriving at the decision to terminate as well as to prevent researchers from influencing a patient\u2019s decision.\u201d American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology 2015 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26432465\n\n\u201cResearch using fetal tissue has allowed for development of vaccines for numerous diseases including polio, rubella, and measles.\u201d\n\n\u201cVaccines manufactured in human fetal cell lines contain unacceptably high levels of fetal DNA fragment contaminants.

A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide. Behavioural analyses in these mice revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity. The demonstrated neurotoxicity of aluminum hydroxide and its relative ubiquity as an adjuvant suggest that greater scrutiny by the scientific community is warranted.

Misconceptions about Al bioavailability may have misled scientists regarding the significance of Al in the pathogenesis of AD. The hypothesis that Al significantly contributes to AD is built upon very solid experimental evidence and should not be dismissed. Immediate steps should be taken to lessen human exposure to Al, which may be the single most aggravating and avoidable factor related to AD.

Although this relationship was independent of measured confounders, it could be due to differences in other unmeasured lifestyle factors or systematic bias. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674905000266\n\nThe relationship between vaccine refusal and self-report of atopic disease in children\n\nThe Christchurch Health and Development Study comprises 1,265 children born in 1977. The 23 children who received no diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus (DPT) and polio immunizations had no recorded asthma episodes or consultations for asthma or other allergic illness before age 10 years; in the immunized children, 23.1% had asthma episodes, 22.5% asthma consultations, and 30.0% consultations for other allergic illness. Similar differences were observed at ages 5 and 16 years. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9345669/\n\n\u201cThe odds of having a history of asthma was twice as great among vaccinated subjects than among unvaccinated subjects.
