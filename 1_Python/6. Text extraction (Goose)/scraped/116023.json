Stop The Routine Use Of Antibiotics.", "cleaned_text": "Today, I\u2019m launching a major petition and I need your help.\n\nThis issue is deeply personal. A couple of years ago my Dad was infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and was hospitalized as a result.\n\nNeedless to say, it was one of the most stressful and scary times of my life. Thankfully with good medical care, my Dad survived but the antibiotics he was supposed to be given to treat the infection were deemed useless.\n\nAs you may know, I\u2019m known for getting the yoga mat chemical \u2013 azodicarbonamide \u2013 out of Subway\u2019s famous bread last year. Over 100 thousand of us signed this petition (1), and without you Subway would have never made this change.\n\nI thank you so much for making that happen.\n\nBut today I\u2019m not talking about yoga mats and shoe rubber.\n\nThere\u2019s an even bigger issue that we need to address at Subway.\n\nI have been working with several experts and consumer advocacy groups (2) for the past year on this very important issue, and we now need your voice.\n\nSubway is one of the largest fast food chains in the world and is serving us meat that is raised with antibiotics. This is irresponsible because:\n\u2022 Antibiotics are being routinely fed to farm animals \u2013 not to treat diseases \u2013 but to fatten them up and make them grow bigger on less food (4).\n\u2022 Almost all of the antibiotics used in the U.S. are fed to farm animals and the amount continues to rise (5).\n\u2022 This misuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population (6). When animals are constantly fed low levels of antibiotics, they become a breeding ground for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and it\u2019s spreading to humans (7).\n\u2022 We now have bacterial infections that only a few years ago could be cured and are now not responsive to any known antibiotics. Thousands of people are dying every year and experts believe it\u2019s going to get worse (8).\n\nWe sent two letters earlier this year (9) to the CEO of Subway asking him to engage with us to discuss opportunities for them to step up as leaders and commit to eliminating these antibiotics from their chicken suppliers, and eventually to eliminate these antibiotics across all supply chains.\n\nSubway has failed to take a stand and hasn\u2019t made a formal commitment.\n\nOther major food companies have publicly committed to stop this practice (10), and it\u2019s time to demand that Subway do the same!\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m petitioning Subway to formally prohibit the routine use of antibiotics for growth promotion and disease prevention in the production of meat across all supply chains, including their turkey, chicken, beef, and pork.\n\nJoin me and sign this petition here.\n\nLet\u2019s create a safer food system together. Do this for you, your children and the human races.\n\nI\u2019m doing it for my Dad.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Subway: We Want Subs Not Drugs!
