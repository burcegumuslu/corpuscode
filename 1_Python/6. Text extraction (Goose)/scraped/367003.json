In no event will the Chopra Parties be liable to you or anyone else for loss, damage or injury relating to any third-party providing you with services, including, but not limited to, Chopra Partners and Chopra Certified (Meditation and Health) Teachers and Chopra Certified Health and Wellness Coaches. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply. In no event will the Chopra Parties\u2019 total liability to you for all damages, loss, or causes of action, if any, exceed the amount you have paid to Chopra for the product or service giving rise to the claim.\n\nThe limitation of liability set out above does not apply to liability resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nYou shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Chopra and its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, licensors, suppliers, service providers, employees, and representatives (the \u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, expenses, damages and/or liabilities, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs, incurred by the Indemnified Parties in any way related to your (a) acts and/or omissions on or off the Digital Properties or while otherwise using or accessing our Services; (b) violation of any rights of another party, including without limitation any alleged infringement of intellectual property or other right of any person or entity relating to the Digital Properties, Services, or User Generated Material; (c) breach of these Terms; (d) disputes with or between other users; (e) use and/or misuse of the Digital Properties or Materials; (f) violation of any applicable law or regulation; (g) submitting inaccurate, untimely, incomplete or misleading User Generated Material; (h) misstatements and/or misrepresentations; or (i) contracts or arrangements made or provided based on any Materials provided via the Services.

Chopra reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by, and you shall not, in any event, settle any claim or matter on behalf of Chopra without the written consent of Chopra. This indemnification obligation shall survive the cessation of your use of the Services.\n\nIf applicable, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\u201d\n\nIf any controversy, allegation or claim arises out of or relates to the Services, Materials, your access or use of the Digital Properties, or these Terms, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution thereto. If we do not have a current physical or email address for you, then we have no obligation under this section. Your notice to us must be sent to us at our contact details below. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, we will engage in a dialogue with you in order to attempt to resolve the dispute though nothing will require either of us to resolve the dispute on terms with respect to which either you or we, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable. If you have any concerns or objections regarding any financial charges, you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card or third-party payment processing charges until and unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter directly with us.\n\nAll disputes arising out of or relating the Services, Materials, your access or use of the Digital Properties, or these Terms that remain unresolved following the dialogue described above will be exclusively resolved under confidential binding arbitration held in New York County, New York in accordance with the applicable Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator\u2019s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, disputes will be mediated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any mediator selected pursuant to this section holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to mediate in this section will not apply and the dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to the following paragraph.\n\nExcept to the extent that mediation is required, any action or proceeding relating to any dispute may only be instituted in federal court in New York County, New York. Accordingly you and we consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in New York County, New York to enforce these Terms or to prevent an infringement of a third party\u2019s rights. In the event equitable relief is sought, each party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such court.

If you choose not to receive push notifications, you may still receive in-app notifications.\n\nNotwithstanding your indicated email marketing preferences, we may send you administrative emails regarding Chopra, including, for example, order confirmations or information about Services you have purchased as well as notices of updates to the Privacy Policy or these Terms if we choose to provide such notices to you in this manner.

You may purchase a full package for a retreat including event tickets, hotel accommodations and certain value-added products and services. In certain circumstances we may offer the opportunity for you to separately purchase event tickets or subsequently add value-added products and services or additional nights hotel stay to your retreat reservation.

We also recognize that due to the lifting of mask mandates in public spaces, such as airplanes and hotels, more stringent safety requirements that we might seek to enforce at Chopra events regarding COVID would be insufficient to fully control the environment at our events.\n\nConsequently, as of August 10, 2022, we are no longer requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination or negative testing prior to attendance at Chopra events. In addition, although we highly encourage guests to continue to wear masks indoors at our events, we will not be enforcing a mask mandate unless required by local regulations.\n\nPlease note that our policies and procedures continue to be based on the current nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health guidance, among other factors. Accordingly, this policy is subject to change.

Following the date that is 45 days prior to the retreat, the amount of your PV will be reduced by a cancellation fee: please refer to your confirmation e-mail for the applicable cancellation fee. No PV will be provided in the event of a cancellation on or after the day the retreat starts.\n\u2022 PVs may be used to purchase any other Chopra product or service, expressly excluding attendance at the Chopra Health Retreat at CIVANA Resort & Spa. Please note that due to the pending cessation of Chopra retreats, your PV may only be eligible for use in connection with Chopra digital products, including our Meditation, Health and Coaching Certification programs, and any consumer products we may offer. All PVs expire eighteen (18) months following their issuance.\n\u2022 For double occupancy packages where one guest cancels, the remaining guest is responsible for paying the balance due for a single occupancy package.\n\u2022 If you cancel your attendance after the start of the retreat, do not show up at a retreat you are scheduled to attend, or leave an event early for any reason, no refunds or Program Vouchers will be issued.\n\u2022 In the event we determine, in our sole reasonable discretion, that a retreat must be postponed due to factors beyond our control, we will automatically enroll you in the rescheduled retreat; in the event you choose not to attend the rescheduled retreat, we will issue you a Program Voucher for the full amount of your purchase, excluding any administrative fees associated with payment plans.\n\u2022 In the event we need to cancel a retreat, we will immediately refund the full purchase price to you.\n\u2022 In order to cancel an event please contact your dedicated Chopra Program Consultant or contact us by phone at 888.736.6895 or email at .\n\u2022 \u201cVirtual Retreats\u201d which offer similar programming as in-person retreats but are conducted entirely online may be cancelled in exchange for a full refund within seven (7) days of purchase or until the start of the retreat, if earlier, by contacting us by phone at 888.736.6895 or email at .\n\nSpecial policies applicable to the Chopra Health Retreat at CIVANA\n\nThe Chopra Health Retreat is a highly structured and more personalized retreat with five (5) day program sessions offered at CIVANA on an ongoing basis, usually twice monthly.
