With an average sale price of around $300 per share in Q3 of 2021, this means that the Gates Foundation banked roughly $260 million in cash from the sale, with $242 million being untaxed profit, given that the money was invested through the foundation. And that doesn\u2019t account for the additional 2 million shares that the Gates Foundation sold prior to that from its original pre-IPO equity investment. In the Q3 2021 sale, the Gates Foundation secured a return of over 15 times more than its initial investment.\n\nOver the next quarter, Gates unloaded 1.4 million shares of Curevac, another Germany-based mRNA company that has partnered with several mRNA shot manufacturers, banking an estimated $50 million.\n\nAfter selling his mRNA company shares, Gates changed his tune on the tech behind the \u201cmiracle cure.\u201d Gates, who once claimed that vaccination with mRNA shots had a preventive effect and \u201chelps your heart,\u201d began to criticize the experimental injections.\n\nIn November of 2021, Gates, after dumping 86 percent of his BioNTech bag, shockingly declared that \u201cwe need a new way of doing the vaccines.\u201d\n\n\"We didn't have vaccines that block transmission,\" Gates said, contradicting all of his previous interviews in which he continuously claimed the shots were safe and significantly block transmission. \"We got vaccines that help you with your health, but they only slightly reduce the transmission,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd last week, Gates amped up his doubtful rhetoric about mRNA, continuing to distance himself from the once hyped technology that he used to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in pandemic profits.\n\n\u201cWe also need to fix the three problems of [mRNA] vaccines,\u201d Gates said in an interview with an Australian think tank. \u201cThe current vaccines are not infection blocking. They\u2019re not broad, so when new variants come up you lose protection, and they have very short duration, particularly in the people who matter, which are old people.\u201d\n\nBill Gates has never publicly commented, as far as The Dossier is aware, on his BioNTech cash out.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99b8f11-48cf-4fed-a74f-4aa166efbc79_1200x800.jpeg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1776985/000119312519241112/d635330dex1037.htm", "https://twitter.com/KanekoaTheGreat/status/1610380950768345088?s=20&t=qfDGQns2bseDVkRMcRCu7A", "https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-scientists-say-vaccines-slash-infection-as-bill-gates-insists-the-end-to-the-pandemic-will-come-12284080"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
