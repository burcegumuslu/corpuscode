He was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998.\n\nTAMPA, Florida (CNN) \u2014 The sick men are Marines, or sons of Marines. All 20 of them were based at or lived at Camp Lejeune, the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 training base in North Carolina, between the 1960s and the 1980s.\n\nThey all have had breast cancer, a disease that strikes fewer than 2,000 men in the United States a year, compared with about 200,000 women. Each has had part of his chest removed as part of his treatment, along with chemotherapy, radiation or both.\n\nAnd they blame their time at Camp Lejeune, where government records show drinking water was contaminated with high levels of toxic chemicals for three decades, for their illnesses.\n\n\u201cWe come from all walks of life,\u201d said Mike Partain, the son and grandson of Marines, who was born on the base 40 years ago. \u201cAnd some of us have college degrees, some of us have blue-collar jobs. We are all over the country. And what is our commonality? Our commonality is that we all at some point in our lives drank the water at Camp Lejeune. Go figure.\u201d\n\nStarting in 1980, tests showed drinking water at Camp Lejeune had been \u201chighly contaminated\u201d with solvents. Several wells that supplied water to the base were found to have been contaminated in 1984 and 1985, and were promptly taken out of service after the pollutants were found, the Marine Corps told CNN.\n\nAmong the chemicals later identified in the drinking water were trichloroethylene, a degreaser; benzene; and the dry cleaning solvent perchloroethylene. Two \u201cindependent studies\u201d have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses, according to the Marine Corps.
