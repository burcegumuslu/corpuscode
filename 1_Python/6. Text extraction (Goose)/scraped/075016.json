PPE (personal protective equipment) was always in short supply and the rules changed almost daily, making it difficult to make sense of the situation.\n\nAlmost right off the bat, Wright could see that things did not make sense. The face masks staff were given, for instance, clearly stated on the box that they were \u201cnot for medical use.\u201d It was also clearly written that these coverings did not protect against the Wuhan Flu.\n\nEven so, Wright and her coworkers were forced to wear them for 12 hours every day, which made it difficult to breathe and stay oxygenated. On top of that, many workers decided to quit long before the vaccines were even released, putting additional strain on an already difficult situation.\n\n\u201cI remember one morning in particular administrators met us at the door to give us small bags of candy just before Christmas 2020, then we were delivered a $15 gift card through the mail at home but paid our own taxes on our paychecks,\u201d Wright recalled about some of the other strange things that were happening at the time.\n\n\u201cHonestly why did you not keep your candy, cheering, and signs and just pay the small taxes for each gift card? I did not feel like a hero at all, I felt expendable just as I do now.\u201d\n\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, though, was when the facility demanded that Wright and all of her colleagues take one of Donald \u201cfather of the vaccine\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d injections in order to remain employed.\n\nAs a medical professional with a strong educational background, Wright could not reconcile being told that she must take an experimental medication against her will in order to remain part of the operation.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is educated and informed enough to make a conscious decision of medical treatment, vaccination, or health plan I am 100% qualified to make that decision for myself and my children,\u201d Wright says.\n\n\u201cI am a patient and staff advocate. We at the bedside educate each patient, as it is their right, of their care plan and medications. Our patients have a RIGHT to refuse any treatment or medication for whatever reason they choose, and I will stand beside them on their educated decision. If a patient chose to refuse lifesaving treatment and would rather go home to pass peacefully then I support their decision, this is what we do! I do not force treatment on patients against their will because this is against the law, unethical and immoral. I must also advocate for myself too because no one else obviously will.\u201d\n\nEspecially since the risks of taking these injections are high, Wright was not about to comply just because it was being demanded of her. She is concerned about what mRNA genetic reprogramming might do to her body, not to mention the fact that the jabs are made from aborted human fetal tissue.\n\nAs part of Wright\u2019s op-ed, The Chattanoogan included multiple responses from readers who understand Wright\u2019s position and support her fully in it. It turns out that freedom of choice in medicine is popular among ordinary people, if only politicians and \u201cpublic health\u201d officials felt the same way.\n\nThe latest news about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d tyranny can be found at Fascism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "MEDICAL EXODUS: Nurse quits over tyrannical covid vaccine mandates", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2021-09-24-exodus-nurse-quits-tyrannical-covid-vaccine-mandates.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "The Chattanoogan recently published the resignation letter of a Tennessee nurse who quit her job due to the creeping onslaught of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) tyranny.
