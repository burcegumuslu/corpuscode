He knows people who were subject to Moscow\u2019s coerced vaccine scheme personally. Some of whom may be related to him.\n\nBy their deeds you will know them.\n\nVladimir Putin has heroically quarantined himself, purportedly after \u201cseveral\u201d people in his inner circle tested positive for Covid-19. Is he hiding from Covid or the fact that his openly pro-mandatory vax political party, United Russia, is expected to get hammered in the upcoming Duma elections on September 19?\n\nThe Russian president is doubled-jabbed with Sputnik V and has tested negative for The Virus. Still, one can never be too careful, especially when your unchallenged Uniparty is polling at 27% among likely voters less than a week away from parliamentary elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how Sputnik V works in practice,\u201d the Russian leader said on Tuesday. \u201cI hope that everything will be as it should, and Sputnik V will show its high levels of protection against Covid in real life.\u201d\n\nWhat the heck is going on here?\n\nWhat is the point of being vaccinated if it is necessary to self-isolate after interacting with a PCR-positive individual, even though you\u2019ve tested negative? How is that even logical? And hasn\u2019t Putin been in a weird Zoom Meeting Bubble for a year? What exactly does \u201cself-isolate\u201d mean in this context?\n\nThis is the same guy who has never been photographed wearing a mask in public.\n\nIt\u2019s not logical, of course. It\u2019s Bio-Security Theater. Not to be confused with its identical twin, Terrorism-Security Theater.\n\nJust to reiterate: Putin\u2019s party, United Russia, is not doing too great in the polls. The party currently holds 334 of 450 seats in parliament, but its comfortable majority could evaporate if it doesn\u2019t find a way to remedy its plunging political support, estimated at 27% by pollsters.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly an inspiring figure when you consider Russia\u2019s \u201copposition\u201d parties are either co-opted by the Kremlin or can have their candidates barred from running on spurious grounds. [Such as several Communist candidates this year.] Only widescale voter apathy can save United Russia now. Or maybe sympathy for their Quarantined Great Leader.\n\nThe nosedive in popularity is fully deserved, by the way:\n\nWe tried to warn you people but you didn\u2019t listen. We practically wrote a book about how Russia\u2019s upper management is infested by Forced Vax Fanatics who are indistinguishable from their unsavory Western peers \u2013 and that it was the Russian people, not their horribly tragic government, who should be celebrated for resisting the worst impulses of Covid-fueled degeneracy.\n\nRussians are done with Covid. Their \u201cleaders\u201d? Not so much. Everyone must be injected.\n\nNew narratives are being weaved. Brace yourself for a smorgasbord of new Highly Transmissible, More Severe Strains.\n\nCelebrity doctor Denis Protsenko, who was urged by Putin to run for parliament after calling for mandatory vaccination, is now predicting that Russia will be hit by a wave of Covid Terror in the coming weeks. You better believe him! This brave, clairvoyant medical expert \u201ccoincidentally\u201d called for compulsory vaccination on the same day that Moscow secretly adopted its forced jab decree.\n\nMore coercive vaccination policies are on their way. They are pretty open about it:\n\nIsn\u2019t it time to confront the truth, no matter how unappetizing it may be?", "opengraph": {"title": "Russia Is in Trouble", "description": "Editor's note: If Slavsquat sounds bitter here, it's because he is, and he has the right to be.
