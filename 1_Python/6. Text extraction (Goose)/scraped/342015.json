The indictment is sure to ripple through his latest presidential campaign,\u201d Axios reported, adding context to the charges.\n\nThe charges against Trump come more than four years after his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for his role in the scheme. Cohen has been cooperating with authorities and serving as a witness against Trump, but there have been some who have called Cohen\u2019s testimony into question.\n\n\u201cThis evening we contacted Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s Office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal,\u201d a spokesperson for Bragg told Axios. \u201cGuidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected.\u201d\n\nBut few people other than brainwashed Democratic voters believe Trump is guilty of anything. And some of his political rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, his most serious challenger for the 2024 presidential nomination, is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Trump, pledging non-cooperation with any extradition order, should one be issued.\n\n\u201cThe weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. It is un-American,\u201d DeSantis tweeted following the indictment.\n\n\u201cThe Soros-backed Manhattan District Attorney has consistently bent the law to downgrade felonies and to excuse criminal misconduct. Yet, now he is stretching the law to target a political opponent. Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda,\u201d he added.\n\nExtradition would only be required if the former president refused to leave his Mar-a-Lago home in the Sunshine State to attend an arraignment hearing in New York.\n\n\u201cThey just indicted President Trump. Unfortunately for them, this will only make him\u2026stronger. I didn\u2019t think I could possibly support him more, but this political Witch Hunt only strengthens our resolve to fight. We\u2019ve got your back, Mr. President,\u201d 2022 Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake \u2014 whose name has been mentioned as a potential Trump running mate \u2014 tweeted.\n\nDuring an interview Thursday evening with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said he had spoken to Trump earlier following news of the indictment.\n\n\u201cRemember, Soros gave Alvin Bragg a million dollars. We\u2019re used to seeing these things. Government printing money till it goes out of style in third world countries, and that\u2019s being visited in the United States of America. I spoke with President Trump moments ago, and he\u2019s resolute and concerned about what this does to America\u2019s brand around the world,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\n\u201cI think a motion to dismiss will happen next. If this were ever to be tried, you could not do it in Manhattan. You would see a change of venue in upstate New York. Maybe it\u2019s the only place Donald Trump could get a fair trial. I expect this will be resolved well before that by any court that looks at the way that the law is being tortured in the absence of any charge that would be maintainable against any human being on the Planet Earth other than Donald Trump and against Trump it\u2019s clearly political,\u201d he concluded.", "opengraph": {"title": "Trump, Republicans respond after Soros-backed Manhattan district attorney announces former president has been indicted", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2023-04-02-trump-republicans-respond-after-soros-backed-manhattan-district-attorney-trump.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "The witch hunts against former President Donald Trump are continuing despite the fact that he\u2019s been out of office now for more than two years after the deep state stole his reelection in 2020.
