Albany is moving on a long-sought bill (S1531) that makes mandatory the existing voluntary adult vaccine database. The only reason to do this is that at some point they intend to enforce compliance \u2013 exactly like the State uses the childhood database to deny children access to school. The adult database will provide the necessary information to enforce vaccine passports and will be used to deny you the right to work, practice your profession, go to college, access healthcare, access public places, travel, and all the other repressive measures they already used with COVID passports, and are still using, like denying access to SUNY and CUNY, healthcare professionals, etc. And they are doing this at the same time that Governor Hocul and Attorney General are appealing the court decision that threw out their draconian quarantine-camp regulation.\n\nCall your New York State Senator and politely but firmly ask that he or she oppose S1531 and mandatory adult vaccine databases. Please get back to us at: jgilmore@autismactionnetwork.org with what you learn.\n\nWe need to have 32 out of the 63 State Senators opposed to block it. You can look up your State senator here:\n\nHere are some talking points you can use on your phone calls.\n\u2022 What is the need? There are no required vaccines for general population adults,\n\u2022 The database will be used to identify and punish people. It is COVID now, it will be other disorders in the future,\n\u2022 This is the first step to statewide vaccine passports,\n\u2022 Opens the door to demanding all medical records, psychiatric drug, HIV and other STDs, contraceptive use, etc.,\n\u2022 This is taxpayer subsidized marketing for drug companies,\n\u2022 Immigrant rights advocates are concerned it will be used to track and locate undocumented people for deportation,\n\u2022 This bill will disproportionately impact black and brown people who have the lowest rate of COVID vaccine uptake of any racial groups,\n\nThe sponsor is Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan). Co-sponsors include Senate Health Committee Chair Gustavo Rivera (D-Bronx), Sen. Roxanne Persaud (D-Brooklyn), and Sen. Leroy Comrie (D-Queens).\n\nPlease share this message with friends and family and please use the link below to spread the word.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
