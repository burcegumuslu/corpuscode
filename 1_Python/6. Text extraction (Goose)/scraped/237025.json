Moreover, Ukawa said the conference sought to offer them guidance and support.\n\n\u201cGiven the wide range of adverse events, billions of lives could ultimately be in danger,\u201d said Fukushima. Some of these adverse events he cited were \u201ccardiovascular disease,\u201d \u201cautoimmune disease\u201d and \u201csusceptibility to infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those who have fallen ill after being vaccinated should not delay informing their medical institution,\u201d the expert advised. \u201cDon\u2019t be slow.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fukushima, \u201cvaccine damage is now a global problem.\u201d However, he rebuked the central government in Tokyo for \u201cforcefully ignoring\u201d the dangers of the injections, spending \u201ctrillions of yen importing vaccines\u201d and \u201cinciting the population\u201d to get injected.\n\n\u201cLast year, I thought it would be a problem if this vaccine spread \u2013 and I decided it was delusional to think a vaccine would fix the pandemic. In professional magazines, the misunderstanding has finally come to light, and now it is understood how dangerous it is.\u201d\n\nFukushima added that the damage caused by the COVID-19 injections is a form of drug harm.\n\n\u201cThis country has learned its lesson about drug harm, and has become a country that will never suffer drug harm again,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we will eradicate drug harm risks at all costs.\u201d\n\nThe expert asserted during the press conference that the COVID-19 vaccines undermine natural immunity.\n\n\u201cIt can suppress natural immunity. COVID-19 didn\u2019t spread [among the] Japanese at first because they have immunoglobulin A (IgA) in their saliva and they have this kind of resistance to [SARS-CoV-2],\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cHowever, due to vaccination \u2013 natural immunity has been suppressed. This is what happened. I don\u2019t think it will subside at all; it will spread more and more. Most people already have post-vaccination infections.\u201d\n\nFukushima reiterated that \u201cthe people who have the disease right now are not the ones who haven\u2019t been vaccinated, but the ones who have been vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe expert also zeroed in on the mRNA technology used in the COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. (Related: NO QUALITY CONTROL: Three lots of Moderna\u2019s covid \u201cvaccine\u201d pulled from Japan for stainless steel contamination.)\n\n\u201c[When you] wrap the mRNA into nanoparticles, every single cell engulfs it and the cells transform. This is what I know now; the mechanism is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nanoparticles are [also] absorbed by the brain. A stupid scientist would say \u2018they can\u2019t cross the [blood-brain] barrier, so it\u2019s OK.\u2019 I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d\n\nOne of the attendees who lost his wife from the COVID-19 vaccine spoke out during the conference, directing his comments at the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW).\n\n\u201cHow many people are you guys going to kill [with the COVID-19 vaccines]? We The People are neither toys nor guinea pigs. You use mass communications to incite us to [get vaccinated, and] the result is \u2026 we lost our family [members].\u201d\n\nThe participant also issued a challenge to officials of the Japanese health ministry.\n\n\u201cI know that most of you guys [from the MHLW] are not vaccinated. You have said that you have gotten vaccinated, but I heard only 10 percent of you have gotten it. Since you guys have said that the vaccine is undoubtedly safe, would you please demonstrate it by getting your shot first?\u201d\n\nVaccineDamage.news has more stories about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch Dr. Masanori Fukushima as he warns against the COVID-19 vaccine during the Nov. 25 press conference below.\n\nThis video is from the In Search Of Truth channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSpike proteins administered intravenously are engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier, can cause cerebral hemorrhage.", "opengraph": {"title": "Japanese expert warns: COVID-19 injections endanger BILLIONS of lives", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pandemic.news/2022-12-05-japanese-expert-covid-injections-endanger-billions-lives.html", "site_name": "Pandemic News", "description": "A Japanese expert warned against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, arguing that \u201cbillions of lives could ultimately be in danger\u201d due to the experimental injections.
