After the pandemic ends and \u201cnormal market conditions\u201d arrive, he noted the window would open for a \u201csignificant opportunity\u2026from a pricing perspective.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of additional applications for the COVID vaccine may also present itself. A third dose could be needed for variants and regular booster shots, D\u2019Amelio said.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s becoming increasingly likely that an annual revaccination is going to take place,\u201d he said. \u201cFactors like efficacy, booster ability, clinical utility will basically become very important.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Amelio also mentioned that Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine production is exceeding forecasts.\n\n\u201cFor the full year, we had originally said we thought we could do 1.3 billion doses. We\u2019re now at 2 billion doses. And obviously, we\u2019re working to improve upon that number as well.\u201d\n\nIn a February earnings call, D\u2019Amelio said the current vaccine cost is unrepresentative of the company\u2019s pricing model.\n\n\u201cSo the one price that we published is the price with the U.S. of $19.50 per dose. Obviously, that\u2019s not a normal price like we typically get for a vaccine, $150, $175 per dose,\u201d he said, \u201cSo pandemic pricing.\u201d", "opengraph": {"description": "- While the whole world is trying to put an end to the pandemic, a top Pfizer executive told shareholders the company is looking at a \u201csignificant", "title": "Pfizer wants to raise the price of its Covid-19 vaccine", "article_publisher": "dailyhealthpost", "image": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pfizer-vaccine-raise-price-ft.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/pfizer-wants-to-raise-the-price-of-its-covid-19-vaccine/", "site_name": "DailyHealthPost", "article:published_time": "2021-03-18T21:12:47-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-03-18T21:12:48-04:00", "updated_time": "2021-03-18T21:12:48-04:00", "locale": "en_US", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost", "article:section": "Wellness", "image:secure_url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pfizer-vaccine-raise-price-ft.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Pfizer wants to raise the price of its Covid-19 vaccine", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://investors.pfizer.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Barclays-Global-Healthcare-Conference/default.aspx", "mailto:?subject=Pfizer%20wants%20to%20raise%20the%20price%20of%20its%20Covid-19%20vaccine&body=While%20the%20whole%20world%20is%20trying%20to%20put%20an%20end%20to%20the%20pandemic%2C%20a%20top%20Pfizer%20executive%20told%20shareholders%20the%0D%0A%0D%0ARead More Here: %20https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fpfizer-wants-to-raise-the-price-of-its-covid-19-vaccine%2F%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Pfizer+wants+to+raise+the+price+of+its+Covid-19+vaccine&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fpfizer-wants-to-raise-the-price-of-its-covid-19-vaccine%2F%3Futm_source%3Dflipboard%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fpfizer-wants-to-raise-the-price-of-its-covid-19-vaccine%2F%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://dailyhealthpost.com/widely-used-painkiller-may-reduce-likelihood-of-covid-19-infection/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-03-18T21:12:47-04:00"}
