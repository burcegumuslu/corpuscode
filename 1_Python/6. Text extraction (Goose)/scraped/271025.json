Just look all around the world and we see gay parades and homosexuals coming out of the closet with massive support for it.\n\nNo one today is interpreting these prophecies.\n\nFor decades, I listened to American preachers and biblical so-called doctors and scholars claiming to be \u2018watchmen\u2019 acting courageously while rattling their tongues about unfulfilled allegoric prophecies they interpreted as being Rome\u2019s revival.\n\nThey never once quoted this prophecy by Isaiah or the ones regarding the rise of homosexuality by Ezekiel, Jude, Paul, John and even Christ Himself who warned about a revival of \u201cSodom\u201d.\n\nAnd just like the ignorance of Israel, prior to Christ\u2019s First Coming, these unpopular prophecies are being fulfilled right in front of their very eyes and will become the foundation stone after they are fulfilled.\n\nIn all of their schools, government buildings and cities, even at their football stadiums and sports arenas they see all the sodomites \u201cparade their sin like Sodom does and they do not even try to hide it\u201d.\n\nIn other words, God says that the homosexuals have come out of the closet.\n\nEveryone sees all the displays and banners proudly hovering everywhere and not a single human being is pointing to the Scriptures and warning the world.\n\nWhere are all these preachers, doctors of theology and \u2018prophecy\u2019 teachers now?\n\nWhy are they so silent?\n\nThe answer to our question is simple: unlike the Christians of ancient Rome who were slaughtered and were eaten alive and shredded by wild beasts for standing up for what they believed in, these modern preachers like that of ancient Rome, which they proclaimed that one day will revive, they themselves swallowed their own tongues, for they too fear yet love the coliseum.\n\nIn this volume, get ready to spend many months studying what you have never studied before.\n\nI have been working on this volume for three years to only discover what I have never imagined myself to discover\u2013prophecy finally unlocked.\n\nTo read this lengthy volume in a more complete PDF format, click here to upload the book.\n\nIf not, you can read the book on this attachment here:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Keys To Unlock The Signs Of The End, And Why You Must Get Ready To Leave Your Cities - Walid Shoebat", "description": "By Walid Shoebat (Shoebat Sunday Special) St. Jerome of Bethlehem explained that Isaiah, Daniel and the Apocalypse were sealed until the future when: \u201cthat book can be opened by one who has learned the mysteries of Scripture and understands its hidden truths, and its words which seem dark because of the greatness of the secrets [\u2026]", "url": "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/", "site_name": "Walid Shoebat", "article:published_time": "2021-05-10T03:07:29+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-03T17:29:47+00:00", "image": "https://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/My-Post-2021-05-09T195347.361.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://shoebat.com/?attachment_id=143703", "https://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/book-final.pdf", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=facebook", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=twitter", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=reddit", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=linkedin", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/#print", "#", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=skype", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=telegram", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=pocket", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=pinterest", "https://shoebat.com/2021/05/09/the-keys-to-unlock-the-signs-of-the-end-and-why-you-must-get-ready-to-leave-your-cities/?share=tumblr", "https://shoebat.com/donation/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-05-10T03:07:29+00:00"}
