Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief litigation counsel for Children\u2019s Health Defense, during an episode of \u201cRFK Jr. The Defender Podcast.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s much, much bigger than that.\u201d\n\nLatypova said we have government reports describing the COVID-19 vaccines as a biological weapon. \u201cI have a question to our government,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is it that they\u2019re exactly forcing on us?\u201d\n\nThe DOD is \u201cfully in charge\u201d of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and the vaccine\u2019s manufacturing and distribution, and it owns the vaccine \u201cuntil it is injected into a person,\u201d she said.\n\nBy creating a \u201cpseudo-legal structure\u201d over time that included Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and other transaction authority agreements \u2014 called OTAs \u2014 the U.S. government allowed the military to take over the distribution of vaccines without adhering to historical safety testing guidelines or product recall procedures.\n\nAccording to Latypova, the notion that the COVID-19 vaccines met regulatory standards for safety and effectiveness was the \u201cbiggest lie that was sold to the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am describing a very illegal structure that\u2019s made legal on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlawful. They \u2014 the government \u2014 are driving this.\u201d\n\nKennedy agreed with Latypova and pointed out that OTA was designed to allow the Pentagon to quickly buy weapons and weapons systems without paying attention to any existing regulatory authorities.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve taken that authority and they\u2019ve applied it to the vaccines so they\u2019re purchasing the vaccines under OTA as a demonstration product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a huge military operation and the involvement of the drug companies is a kind of window dressing.\u201d\n\nThe DOD paid the pharmaceutical companies for their brand names so people would think they were getting something from Pfizer or Moderna \u2014 but all of the distribution and manufacturing is done by the military, Kennedy said. The pharmaceutical companies were brought in to put their name on it and then to pretend to do clinical trials, he said.\n\nLatypova and Kennedy discussed how the military accomplished this without most workers involved in the production and distribution of the vaccine catching on.\n\nThey also discussed how citizens and lawyers might effectively challenge the Pentagon\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination project in the court system.\n\nRead More: U.S. MILITARY RUNS COVID VACCINES, FORMER PHARMA EXEC TELLS RFK JR.", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VACCINE-MASS-MURDER.jpeg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VACCINE-MASS-MURDER.jpeg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "506", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/03/31/u-s-military-runs-covid-vaccines-former-pharma-exec-tells-rfk-jr/", "description": "The U.S. government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination effort is a biological weapon project run by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), according to Alexandra Latypova, a former pharmaceutical research and development executive with 25 years of industry experience.
