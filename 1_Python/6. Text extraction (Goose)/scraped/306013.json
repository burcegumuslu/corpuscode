Porzio wrote in his ruling that if the vaccine mandate was about \u201csafety and public health, unvaccinated workers would have been placed on leave the moment the order was issued.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was about safety and public health, the Health Commissioner would have issued city-wide mandates for vaccination for all residents,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn a City with a nearly 80% vaccination rate, we shouldn\u2019t be penalizing the people who showed up to work, at great risk to themselves and their families, while we were locked down.\u201d\n\nPorzio\u2019s ruling states that the Oct. 20, 2021, and Dec. 13, 2021, rulings from the commissioner of health and mental hygiene ordering that all employees get vaccinated are \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d ordering that the petitioners be reinstated to their full employment status, and entitled to back pay in salary from date of termination.\n\n\u201cYesterday marked a historic victory for sanitation workers, all the brave NYC employees who serve the public and our representative democracy,\u201d attorney Chad LaVeglia told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe court struck down NYC\u2019s draconian, arbitrary, vaccine mandate on multiple constitutional and legal grounds. The thousands of city employees who were ignored now have a voice. And as the court recognized, they deserve better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court also recognized a commonsense principle that has somehow eluded politicians like Eric Adams: Forcing one \u2014 and only one \u2014 segment of the population to get vaccinated during a worldwide outbreak is unconstitutional and arbitrary,\u201d he added. \u201cSixteen sanitation workers fought back against tyranny. And won. This is a historic victory for individual rights, and the system of government mandated by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Signal. According to the court filing, the Department of Sanitation employees were terminated in February 2022 for \u201cfailure to comply with vaccination requirements\u201d after the health commissioner of the City of New York, David Chokshi, issued a vaccination mandate requiring all city employees to show \u201cproof of at least one dose of vaccination against COVID-19\u201d by Oct. 29.\n\n\u201cOn March 24, 2022, Mayor Adams enacted Executive Order No. 62, which provided blanket exemptions from the private employers\u2019 vaccine mandate for athletes, performers, and other artists,\u201d the ruling said. The judge highlighted the petitioners\u2019 central argument that Adams\u2019 order \u201crendered the public employee vaccination mandate arbitrary and capricious or unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore,\u201d the judge wrote, \u201cthe Petitioners all claim, and provided laboratory documentation, that they have natural immunity to COVID-19 from prior infection(s). Respondents\u2019 central argument is that the private employers\u2019 exemption order and the public employee vaccination mandates were \u2018created separately, and exist independently, of each other.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city strongly disagrees with this ruling as the mandate is firmly grounded in law and is critical to New Yorkers\u2019 public health,\u201d a New York Law Department spokesman said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have already filed an appeal. In the meantime, the mandate remains in place as this ruling pertains solely to the individual petitioners in this case. We continue to review the court\u2019s decision, which conflicts with numerous other rulings already upholding the mandate.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New York Supreme Court Reinstates Unvaccinated Employees With Back Pay: \u2018It Was About Compliance\u2019 - The Stream", "description": "A New York\u00a0judge ordered Monday\u00a0that Department of Sanitation employees terminated for refusing to get vaccinated be reinstated to their full employment status, writing that the\u00a0vaccination mandate\u00a0for city employees was \u201cnot just about safety and public health; it was about compliance.\u201d", "url": "https://stream.org/new-york-supreme-court-reinstates-unvaccinated-employees-with-back-pay-it-was-about-compliance/", "site_name": "The Stream", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheStream.org/", "article:published_time": "2022-10-26T15:36:51+00:00", "image": "https://stream.org/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406960186-1.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "506", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Russia-Ukraine War", "Religious Liberty", "Abortion", "Biden Scandal", "Banking Crisis", "Revival", "China", "Transgender"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://stream.org/author/mary-olohan/", "https://stream.org/author/mary-olohan/", "http://www.daisurvey.com/StreamWebsite", "https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/85163_2022_George_Garvey_et_al_v_City_of_New_York_et_al_DECISION___ORDER_ON_38.pdf", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/02/02/big-board-dc-bar-defies-vaccine-mandate-rand-paul/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/85163_2022_George_Garvey_et_al_v_City_of_New_York_et_al_DECISION___ORDER_ON_38.pdf", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/26/grappling-with-dc-vaccine-mandate-capitol-hill-restaurant-owner-pleads-for-decency/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/09/22/as-vaccine-mandates-increase-religious-exemptions-come-under-fire/", "https://stream.org/donate/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/23/biden-voter-explains-her-stand-against-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/10/25/new-york-supreme-court-reinstates-unvaccinated-employees-with-backpay/"], "authors": ["Mary Margaret Olohan"], "publish_date": "2022-10-26T15:36:51+00:00"}
