The shockwaves that it sent through the world as the mortality rate grew almost exponentially were palpable. Its reach was keenly felt not just economically, but also emotionally and psychologically as well.\n\nBecause of this, it\u2019s safe to say that there is no one in the world right now who wants the events of 2020 to repeat itself. Yet, thanks to the continuing spikes in cases of COVID variants there may still be serious cause for concern. If recent studies and stats are to be believed, we inch ever closer to repeating 2020 once again.\n\nThankfully, not only are we not quite there yet, there are ways to ensure that we pull back from the brink and put all the sordid experiences of the past in our rearview!\n\nWe\u2019ll be sharing crucial tips on how to make that happen now.\n\nWhile there are treatments in use for COVID, there\u2019s currently no cure for the virus. And, if for no other reason than the fact that this virus has proven to be remarkably adept at mutating, the chances are high that this will remain the case for a while into the future.\n\nIn the meantime, some of the best ways that we can forestall another pandemic are to;\n\nGet Vaccinated as Soon as Possible\n\nEven though quite a lot of people have acknowledged the potential benefits of the COVID vaccine and have taken their shots, a lot more people still hold deep reservations about getting vaccinated.\n\nSome of the most common reasons that people shy from the COVID vaccine include;\n\u2022 None They believe that COVID hasn\u2019t been around long enough for a viable vaccine to be produced.\n\u2022 None They believe the vaccine doesn\u2019t work because even people who took it still contract COVID.\n\u2022 None They believe it isn\u2019t worth the risk of harmful potential side effects.\n\u2022 None They believe the vaccine is defective otherwise it wouldn\u2019t need a booster.\n\nWhile all of these reasons may be valid in their own right, it\u2019s important to remember that, ultimately, this is medicine, and the mechanics behind dealing with a virus as deadly as the coronavirus is extremely complex.\n\nSo even though the vaccine may have some kinks that still need to be worked out, you should still consider taking it as studies confirm that it saves lives and, in many instances, prevents critical illnesses.\n\nEven though things have calmed down considerably now, it\u2019s never a bad idea to maintain safety protocols like washing your hands and sanitizing frequently, maintaining a good distance from other people, and even wearing nose masks.\n\nThe thing about these practices is that they don\u2019t only help curb COVID, but they can also reduce the infection rate of a host of other diseases as well!\n\nLast but not least, leveraging reliable COVID self-testing kits like Flowflex antigen test can do a lot to prevent another major outbreak. This is because, with these tools, you can monitor your health more efficiently so you know when to quarantine and, by extension, reduce the number of people you infect if you contract the virus.\n\nYou\u2019ll also know when to seek proper treatment, increasing your chances of beating COVID.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no disputing the fact that a lot will have to be done if we\u2019re to stay safe, implementing these measures is without a doubt a good place to start!", "opengraph": {"description": "The effects of the pandemic of two years ago were epic, to say the least.
