Realistically, if we\u2019re going to return to normal, we need to develop a safe, effective vaccine. We need to make billions of doses, we need to get them out to every part of the world, and we need all of this to happen as quickly as possible. \u2014 Bill Gates, GatesNotes, April 30, 2020\n\nThere are three key elements to Gates\u2019 perspective captured in his blog from April 2020 that we\u2019re now in a position to evaluate retrospectively. These elements relate to his call for 1) the need for broad immunity, 2) a safe and effective vaccine and 3) mass and rapid deployment of these vaccines.\n\nThe top line evaluation looks something like this:\n\nThe COVID-19 jabs have comprehensively failed to do deliver \u201cbroad immunity.\u201d They deliver narrow and short-lived, non-durable immunity that is inferior to the more robust, durable and broader-based immunity acquired following infection by SARS-CoV-2. Please read on.\n\nThe illusory claim of \u201csafe and effective\u201d COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d still perpetuated by health authorities, vaccine manufacturers and the mainstream media is now severely battered. There is now overwhelming evidence of the failure of the jabs to prevent transmission (the primary purpose of conventional vaccines), most notably the omicron variant, the highest infection rates are consistently found in the countries with the greatest jab coverage, rapidly waning effectiveness in reducing risk of hospitalization and death, and an emerging picture of significantly under-reported and widespread vaccine injuries and disruption of the immune response (here, here and here).", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "6 Big Differences Between Natural Vs.
