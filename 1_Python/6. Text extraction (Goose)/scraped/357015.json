Nations felt the pangs of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this pressured and motivated scientists to develop a vaccine. Fortunately, the vaccine quest was successful, and it is now available to the public from a few different manufacturers.\n\nThere are many reasons surrounding the pandemic that one may consider wanting to sue the state government \u2013 from botched handling of lockdown restrictions, vaccine rollout, needless hospitalizations and deaths, working conditions, etc \u2013 but unfortunately, due to the unprecedented nature of this unforeseen event, many of these pandemic-related lawsuits are unlikely to hold water.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine is accepted by a majority of individuals who can\u2019t wait to get back to normal life. Most vaccines come in two doses, about four weeks apart. As with most vaccines, they come with a host of potential side effects. Below are some of the COVID-19 side effects that scientists have documented.\n\n1. Pain and/ or Swelling at the Injection Site\n\nThe administering of the COVID-19 vaccine is mainly through an injection into the biceps. The injected area may later swell or keep feeling pain. According to specialist doctors, this is normal and should shortly subside.\n\nDon\u2019t get surprised if you start feeling tired after getting the immunization, as it is considered normal. This can happen anywhere from a few hours after the immunization to a few days following it. This is caused by your body being busy trying to build up a proper immune response.\n\nEmerging COVID-19 vaccine trends prove that most people get migraines after their first shot of the immunization drug. However, the headaches last for a short while and are mostly mild.\n\nChills mainly occur after the second immunization. It\u2019s one of the reasons that people have considered the vaccine to cause flu-like symptoms. Fortunately, observations show that the chills do not last long, and doctors have advised people to use anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nLike the chills, the fever will pop up due to the antibodies fighting the newly registered stranger in the body. Taking anti-inflammatory drugs will help reduce these effects since the antibodies will reduce. The fever will therefore subside after a short while.\n\nAccording to records, joint pain is experienced by a few people; therefore, it is not a cause for alarm. However, if you feel joint pain, you are advised to use over-the-counter drugs to counteract this side effect.\n\nThere is also a probability that you may start developing a small rash after the injection. Doctors state that this is another rare side effect among those who have taken the vaccine.\n\nWhat to Know About the Side Effects\n\nHaving these side effects after getting the immunization is a normal occurrence. Moreover, the chances that an individual will experience all the seven side effects are close to zero, and they will disappear in 48 hours or less. In most cases, the side effects affect the person after a second shot.\n\nIf you feel like the side effects are getting severe, it is advisable to visit a doctor for further instruction. However, if it\u2019s just a normal uncomfortable feeling, then you could use over-the-counter drugs. If the symptoms last for more than two days or get severe, you need to visit a hospital.\n\nWhatever the case, these mild side effects are still not nearly as bad as the effects of actually getting Covid-19 could be, and hospital records are indicating that nearly all Covid-related hospitalizations are unvaccinated patients.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "7 Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccines", "description": "As with most vaccines, they come with a host of potential side effects.
