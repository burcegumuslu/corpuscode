To fix it, Oswald wants unvaccinated people to be added to the country\u2019s terrorism watchlist.\n\nOswald made these remarks during a speech by Home Secretary Suella Braverman about plans for \u201cmajor reform\u201d to the Prevent program. Braverman told the room full of MPs (members of parliament) that the new-and-improved Prevent program must focus \u201con security, not political correctness.\u201d\n\nOswald welcomed these statements and an associated \u201clong-awaited and damning report\u201d about the subject, to quote Newspunch\u2018s coverage of the matter \u2013 though Oswald added that \u201cthere do remain questions about the focus of what we see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also wonder if she feels a shift in focus is needed to take into account more recent forms of extremism that have emerged since the report was commissioned, things like the QAnon ideology imported from the United States or incels or the anti-vax movement that sprung up during the pandemic,\u201d she added about Braverman\u2019s major reform plans.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we need to see this report in the context of the Met\u2019s head of counterterrorism pointing out that three in four advanced terror plots disrupted in 2021, actually involved right-wing extremists and 41% of counterterrorism arrests in 2021 were of extreme right-wing suspects,\u201d Oswald went on to declare.\n\nIt would thus \u201cbe wrong,\u201d she proceeded to state, \u201cand indeed damaging to stigmatize or marginalize Muslim communities, and that the risks posed by ideologies such as right-wing extremism, and antisemitism, as well as Islamic extremism, must all remain central to any UK counter-terror strategy.\u201d\n\nLeft-wing globalist politicians want the unvaccinated, conservatives, and Christians to be demonized as \u201cterrorists\u201d\n\nAccording to Oswald, focusing primarily on radical Muslims is a bit outdated in light of this new spate of right-wing terror that she claims is sweeping across the UK and putting herself and other globalists at risk.\n\nIn the comments, one person suggested that Oswald is the one who really belongs on the terror watchlist. After all, she and her fellow left-wing globalists are responsible for, or are at the very least complicit in, \u201cthe murder, corruption, de-dollarization, and high inflation\u201d that is occurring right now on the back of the covid scamdemic.\n\n\u201cAll of them are criminals,\u201d this same person added about Oswald et al.\n\nAnother warned that Americans had better defend their Second Amendment rights or else the same type of thing is soon to come to the United States. Brits do not maintain the same right to bear arms that Americans do, and are thus more prone to this type of tyranny because they have fewer means with which to fight back.\n\n\u201cGod forbid they focus on the true terrorists: globalists in places of authority, such as her,\u201d wrote another about Oswald and her evil agenda.\n\n\u201cNow we know why the Mayflower was overcrowded,\u201d expressed another about why people fled the UK in the first place in order to start a new \u201cfree\u201d society in the New World.\n\n\u201cSomeone famous in scientific circles once said that all political parties are terrorist organizations,\u201d wrote another. \u201cThis is quite true regardless of their composition, from monarchists to anarchists and everything in between, because they all get greedy.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the government\u2019s assault on health freedom can be found at HealthFreedom.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "PUREBLOOD WITCH HUNT: British politicians want police to add \u201cunvaccinated people\u201d to terrorism watchlist", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2023-02-13-british-politicians-police-unvaccinated-terrorism-watchlist.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "A counter-terrorism program in the United Kingdom that was originally designed to focus on stopping radical Muslim jihadists from terrorizing the country could soon be modified to also include the \u201cunvaccinated\u201d as targets.
