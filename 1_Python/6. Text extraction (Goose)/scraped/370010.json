It can lead to damage of tissue of the esophagus, alter its structure or cause problems with its normal function. Homeopathic Remedies for Esophagitis help to reduce the inflammation of esophagus and effectively manage its symptoms. It can have various causes. The most common cause behind it is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this condition there is backflow of stomach acid in the food pipe that can irritate its lining and lead to inflammation. Next it can arise from infections. Another reason behind it is use of certain medicines (NSAIDs , some antibiotics, steroids). Apart from this risk factors for it includes alcohol abuse, excessive cigarette use, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, chemical injury by alkaline or acid solutions, physical injury, weak immune system, stress, allergies, crohn\u2019s disease (an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and damage to gastrointestinal system), chronic vomiting, obesity, hiatal hernia (condition in which stomach bulges out from hiatus opening in diaphragm into chest), intense use of Vitamins and supplements, surgery in the chest area. This type usually results from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this disease there is backflow of stomach acid upwards in the food pipe. There is a valve known as LES \u2013 lower esophageal sphincter, that keeps the stomach acid in the stomach and prevents its back flow. This valve opens only when food has to enter the stomach from the food pipe and is closed at all other times. When this valve opens at times other than eating or doesn\u2019t close rightly then the stomach contents can get back in the food pipe. If this occurs frequently for a long time then acid content from the stomach can inflame and damage the lining of the food pipe and this condition is known as reflux esophagitis. There are some factors that increase the chance of GERD and inflammation of esophagus due to stomach acid. This includes taking excessive alcohol, coffee, chocolate, smoking, eating excessive fat and going to bed immediately after eating. This type occurs from an excessive number of eosinophils (a type of WBC \u2013 white blood cell that plays a role in allergic reactions) in the esophagus usually from an over reactive response to an allergen or acid reflux. There are some of the common food triggers for it, for eg, foods such as milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, wheat and shellfish. It can also result from inhaling an allergen like pollen. It is a rare type that occurs from an excessive number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) in the esophageal lining. Crohn\u2019s disease, GERD are some diseases associated with it. This results from taking some of the oral medicines with a very little amount of water. It increases the contact time of medicine with the lining of the food pipe. Some of the examples of these medicines include pain relievers (aspirin,ibuprofen), antibiotics (tetracycline), bisphosphonates, quinidine and potassium chloride. It is rare and can occur from a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection in the esophagus. This type mostly affects people having weak immune systems. Among infections fungus called Candida albicans is common cause of this type. These fungal infections are common in people with low immunity, people who are diabetic, have cancer or those who use steroids. Its symptoms include difficulty swallowing, pain while swallowing, heartburn, pain in the chest behind the breastbone while eating, food getting stuck in the food pipe. Other symptoms that can occur includes nausea, vomiting, decrease in appetite, epigastric pain, sore throat, hoarse voice and cough. Young children may have feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. If not treated well in time there can occur changes in the structure and function of the esophagus. Firstly it can lead to scarring, narrowing (stricture) in the esophagus. Next there can occur ulcers in the esophagus. Another complication is tearing or perforation of the esophagus. Lastly it can lead to Barrett\u2019s esophagus (it is a precancerous condition in which there occurs damage to esophageal lining and changes in cells that line the esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal cancer). Homeopathy offers a very effective treatment for cases of esophagitis. Homeopathic medicines help to reduce the inflammation of esophagus and effectively manage its symptoms.

Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Albuminuria refers to a condition in which albumin (a type of protein) abnormally passes in the urine. Albumin is a major type of protein made in the liver that normally circulates in the blood. Homeopathic medicines for albuminuria mainly play a supportive role in managing such cases. Albumin is the most abundant and significant protein in the blood circulation. It helps in maintaining the right amount of fluid flowing throughout the body and acts as a carrier for fatty acid, thyroid hormones and steroids. The protein should remain in blood and never enter urine under normal circumstances. But when the protein albumin abnormally seeps in the urine it is referred to as albuminuria. The kidneys function to filter the blood in the body. When blood passes through the kidneys it keeps the things required by the body like protein but eliminates the things not needed out of the body as urine. The kidneys have got glomeruli which act as filters. When functioning normally, the protein cannot pass through the filter and enter urine or a very little trace of protein can pass in urine. But in case of damaged kidney excessive albumin can leak out of the kidneys into urine. Some of the conditions that cause a temporary increase of albumin in urine includes dehydration, stress, intense physical activity, cold weather, fever and side effects of some medications. Furthermore, the medical conditions that can lead to rise of albumin levels in the urine. First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. Homeopathic medicines mainly play a supportive role in managing cases of albuminuria. These medicines can be used along with conventional treatment for halting its further progression. Additionally they help in reducing oedema (swelling ) linked with it.

Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Angioedema refers to edema or swelling underneath the skin that can become severe. It usually occurs from an allergic reaction.

Hives also known as urticaria refers to itchy, elevated, red welts/wheals or bumps on the skin surface that occur mostly from an allergic reaction. Homeopathic Remedies for Angioedema are beneficial in all types of angioedema with symptoms having mild to moderate intensity. Angioedema is a harmless condition in most cases and gets well in a few days. However, in serious cases the tongue that can cause blockage of airways and difficulty in breathing that needs prompt medical help. Severe angioedema may be a part of a dangerous medical condition called anaphylaxis needing emergency treatment. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction in which there appears swelling of lips, tongue and throat that blocks airways and leads to breathing problems, rapid heartbeat, sudden drop of blood pressure, dizziness and sometimes fainting. Anaphylaxis is a severe life threatening condition that should be urgently treated with conventional treatment. It most commonly arises from an allergic reaction and this type is known as allergic angioedema. The allergic reaction can occur from certain foods like eggs, peanuts, fish, shellfish and milk. This reaction can also occur from insect bites, pollen, animal dander, latex and poison ivy. The body detects a substance (like any of the above) as something dangerous. Following this there is release of histamine by the body that causes dilatation of the blood vessels and fluid leakage. In severe cases of allergic angioedema, anaphylaxis can occur with swelling of throat, difficulty in breathing and sudden drop in blood pressure. It is a medical emergency needing immediate medical help. It can also arise from the use of certain medicines called drug \u2013 induced angioedema. Few medicines that can lead to it include aspirin, NSAID\u2019s (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs), penicillin, antibiotics and some of the medicines used to control high BP (blood pressure). Thirdly, it may occur after an infection or with illnesses like SLE (It is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and damages healthy tissues of the body. It can affect skin, kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, heart, nervous system, muscles, bones, eyes). Another medical condition linked with it is leukaemia (cancer of blood cells). Other than this a medical condition lymphoma is associated with it. Lymphoma refers to a cancer beginning in lymphocytes which are cells of the immune system that help to fight with infection. In case of lymphoma these lymphocytes change and keep multiplying out of control. Rarely it can occur in people having a family history of it where it is called as hereditary angioedema. Here a person has inherited this condition from a parent through genetic transmission. In hereditary angioedema the body is unable to make a blood protein called C1 esterase inhibitor in the right amount that results in fluid movement from the blood into tissues resulting in swelling. Other than this it can arise if a person has a weak immune system where it is called as acquired angioedema. Lastly, it can be idiopathic type where no cause is ruled out behind swelling. Some factors linked with it include stress, anxiety, intense exercise, exposure to heat and cold and minor infection. Its main sign is swelling below the skin. The swelling can develop suddenly or gradually in a few hours. Sometimes it may be attended with swelling and welts on the surface of the skin (hives) that may be painful and itchy.

They are learning many sorts of new skills during their growth and development phase and can easily become frustrated trying to learn so many things and may blow out aggressively on occasions. With the use of homeopathic remedies for aggression in kids, a gradual decrease in the intensity and frequency of aggressive episodes has been noted. Kids are too young to learn how to control their impulse and have no understanding about which behaviour is right or wrong. A child in aggression may be disobedient, show temper tantrums, may get violent, hit or bite others, use bad language and cause destruction of things. As they grow they eventually outgrow it. But frequent aggressive behaviour which causes interference in school, results in hitting or harming children / adults or causes destruction of things need to be addressed by a doctor to find out if it\u2019s linked to some medical reason or not. Firstly there are certain environmental factors that influence a child and raises the risk of aggressive behaviour in a child. Stressful environment in family, living in environment where child abuse or spouse abuse occurs, where drugs / alcohol is used and socio \u2013 economic factors like poverty are some of the examples of these factors that put an impact on child\u2019s mind and result in aggressive behaviours. In some cases children may mimic aggressive behaviour of some of the family members or sometimes what they see on TV and may get adapted to this habit from there. They can also learn such behaviour from environment like neighbourhood, peers, teachers. Next history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, being got bullied or intense punishment to children can mark the beginning of aggressive and violent behaviour in them. Emotional factors like neglect from family, being raised by a single parent, being left in the hand of a caretaker by parents may also trigger such behaviour in children. Some of the disorders in children can have aggression as one of its attending symptoms. First among them is ADHD which refers to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder characterized by hyperactivity, difficulty in concentration, inattentiveness and impulsiveness. Usually it begins at the age of 3 to 6 yrs and sometimes may tend to continue into adulthood. Second is ODD that refers to oppositional defiant disorder. It is a behavioural disorder in which a child shows persistent patterns of anger, irritability and is argumentative, disobedient or shows vindictiveness towards authority figures. Third is BPD means Bipolar Disorder which is a psychological disorder in which a child has extreme mood swings from feeling high (excitement / mania phase) to feeling low (depression phase). In the excitement phase, a child is happy, shows high energy levels, is very restless, talkative, sleepless, and has aggressive, impulsive behaviour. The symptoms in the depressive phase include sadness, hopelessness, low energy levels, tiredness, loss of interest in daily activities, anxiety. Next is Asperger\u2019s syndrome that is a neurological disorder characterized by difficulties in communication and social interaction; and repetitive behaviour. Another is autism \u2013 a neurodevelopmental disorder occurring in early childhood. In this a child has difficulty with social communication and interaction and shows restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests. Last one is depression which is a psychological condition in which a person persistently feels excessively sad and has a low mood with no interest in doing any work. Other than above factors genetics also play a role in causing aggressive behaviour in children. Family history of aggression, antisocial behaviour raises risk of aggressive behaviour in children. History of brain injury is also linked with aggression in kids. Apart from above some ongoing emotional conflict in mind, lots of stress in early life, anxiety, suppressed emotions in children, frustration, feeling of helplessness in some situations, inability to verbalize the feelings can sometimes explode in aggression and violence when it is too much for a child to handle. Complaint of aggression in kids can be effectively managed with homeopathic medicines. Before giving any medicine it is very important to differentiate if the behaviour is indicating a normal part of a child\u2019s development or if some medical reason is linked with it that needs to be treated. \n\n Mild aggressive episodes that occur as a part of child development can be managed by parents themselves by teaching following a polite and calm approach and avoiding yelling, hitting or punishing. But when the aggression is intense and frequent that is interfering in school, causing destruction of things and harm to others then it needs to be evaluated by a doctor to find the reason behind it and treat it timely to stop it from getting worse. In such cases homeopathic medicines can be of great help. \n\n These medicines are selected individually for every case and work on the root cause behind it to manage this behaviour effectively. \n\n The symptoms of the child are the key to select the medicine that will suit him / her.

Since it is a serious condition that can have severe complications, homeopathic remedies for temporal arteritis should be considered along with conventional treatment Another name for this condition is giant cell arteritis. In this condition, when the cells of the inflamed arteries are looked under microscope they look giant that\u2019s why it is called giant cell arteritis. Though temporal arteritis most commonly affects temporal arteries but it can also occur in other arteries like thoracic arteries. Serious complications can occur in this condition if it is not treated quickly, so immediate medical help should be seeked in these cases. In this condition there occurs inflammation and swelling of the lining of arteries. As a result the blood vessels get narrow due to which there is a decrease in amount of blood flow to body tissues. When blood flow is reduced the tissues get deprived of oxygen and nutrients. It can occur in any medium or large artery but the most commonly involved artery is arteries in the temple region. The exact reason that leads to inflammation of arteries is not known yet. However it is thought that it occurs from autoimmune response of the body in which the immune cells of the body attack and inflame the walls of artery by mistake from a misdirected response.

It has multiple types and among them the most common form is AIDP (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy). In AIDP the protective covering of the nerves known as myelin sheath is damaged. Due to this damage the nerves are not able to send proper signals to the brain and weakness , numbness and paralysis can arise. It has been found that in most cases it occurs some days or weeks after a respiratory illness or a digestive tract infection. Persons of any age group can be affected with this but the risk increases with advancing age. Its chances are more in males as compared to females.

Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin condition in which small, inflamed painful lumps form under the skin. The lumps can break open and release fluid or pus that can have an offensive smell. The tunnels can also form under the skin from connection of these lumps. This skin condition usually occurs in areas where the skin tends to rub together like in armpits, the area under breast or groin (the crease area where the upper part of the thigh and the lower part of the abdomen meet). Homeopathic Treatment for Hidradenitis Suppurativa helps in healing the lumps, nodules, cysts and boils in acute cases as well as chronic cases. This condition is also known as acne inversa. It is a non contagious condition which means it doesn\u2019t spread through direct skin to skin contact. The exact reason behind this condition is not yet clear. It is not caused by an infection and it doesn\u2019t arise from poor hygiene. This condition is known to begin from blockage of hair follicles. It is thought that genetics play a role in it as it is seen to run in families. Next hormonal changes are also thought to have a role in its development as it tends to start after puberty. Another factor that is linked with this condition is an overactive immune system that becomes over responsive to little infections in the clogged hair follicles. Apart from above other factors that are thought to be associated with development of it includes smoking, being overweight and having acne (pimples). Women are at more risk to develop this condition as compared to men. Having a family history of this condition also increases the risk. Persons in the age group of 20 to 39 yrs are at risk. In addition to above having there are certain medical conditions that raises its risk. The first among them is metabolic syndrome that refers to a group of five conditions which increases risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke. These conditions include increased blood pressure, excess fat around the waist, high blood sugar, high levels of triglyceride and low level of good cholesterol. The other two are diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a term to describe two disorders in which there occurs chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. First among these disorders is ulcerative colitis and another is crohn\u2019s disease. This condition can appear in one or several areas of the body. The most common areas involved in it includes armpits, area under breast, groin, inner thighs, anal area and between buttocks. In case of hidradenitis suppurativa red, pimple \u2013 like bumps on skin, painful lumps, deep nodules (solid, elevated under the skin), cyst ( a lump containing fluid or other substance) under skin and boils ( pus filled bumps) can develop. The bumps can be itchy. The boil can drain fluid, pus or blood with an offensive smell. With passing time tunnels (sinus tract) that connect lumps may form under the skin. In this condition the lumps tend to occur on both sides of the body . The bumps keep going away and coming back. The bumps may occur on the same site every time or they may keep changing location. This condition may get worse from stress, being overweight, hormonal changes, heat and smoking. This condition is classified into three stages (called Hurley stages) depending upon its severity. Stage 1 \u2013 In this stage there is single or multiple nodules / boil with little scarring and no sinus tract Stage 2 \u2013 In this stage there are more than one bump with little scarring and limited tunnelling. Stage 3 \u2013 in this stage multiple bumps with extensive scarring and tunnelling appear involving entire area of the body In severe cases or the cases that are left untreated some complications can arise. First among them is infection on the affected skin area. Second is scarring / pitting on the healed part of skin and thickening of the scar. Next is restriction of movement from painful lesions and scar mainly when it affects the axilla. In some cases fistula ( a hollow passage) can form inside the body. Another complication is swelling in arms or legs when the lumps or scars (that occurs in body areas that are near lymph nodes) obstruct the drainage of lymph. Depression can occur in the person with this condition when they avoid going out in public and self isolate them due to draining from the lesion and offensive smell from it. Severe and advanced cases carry a very rare chance of squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancer type). Homeopathy offers a very effective treatment for complaints of hidradenitis suppurativa.

We do not claim to cure any disease which is considered' incurable ' on the basis of scientific facts by modern medicine .The website\u2019s content is not a substitute for direct, personal, professional medical care and diagnosis. . It can have various causes. The most common cause behind it is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this condition there is backflow of stomach acid in the food pipe that can irritate its lining and lead to inflammation. Next it can arise from infections. Another reason behind it is use of certain medicines (NSAIDs , some antibiotics, steroids). Apart from this risk factors for it includes alcohol abuse, excessive cigarette use, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, chemical injury by alkaline or acid solutions, physical injury, weak immune system, stress, allergies, crohn\u2019s disease (an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and damage to gastrointestinal system), chronic vomiting, obesity, hiatal hernia (condition in which stomach bulges out from hiatus opening in diaphragm into chest), intense use of Vitamins and supplements, surgery in the chest area. This type usually results from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this disease there is backflow of stomach acid upwards in the food pipe. There is a valve known as LES \u2013 lower esophageal sphincter, that keeps the stomach acid in the stomach and prevents its back flow. This valve opens only when food has to enter the stomach from the food pipe and is closed at all other times. When this valve opens at times other than eating or doesn\u2019t close rightly then the stomach contents can get back in the food pipe. If this occurs frequently for a long time then acid content from the stomach can inflame and damage the lining of the food pipe and this condition is known as reflux esophagitis. There are some factors that increase the chance of GERD and inflammation of esophagus due to stomach acid. This includes taking excessive alcohol, coffee, chocolate, smoking, eating excessive fat and going to bed immediately after eating. This type occurs from an excessive number of eosinophils (a type of WBC \u2013 white blood cell that plays a role in allergic reactions) in the esophagus usually from an over reactive response to an allergen or acid reflux. There are some of the common food triggers for it, for eg, foods such as milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, wheat and shellfish. It can also result from inhaling an allergen like pollen. It is a rare type that occurs from an excessive number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) in the esophageal lining. Crohn\u2019s disease, GERD are some diseases associated with it. This results from taking some of the oral medicines with a very little amount of water. It increases the contact time of medicine with the lining of the food pipe. Some of the examples of these medicines include pain relievers (aspirin,ibuprofen), antibiotics (tetracycline), bisphosphonates, quinidine and potassium chloride. It is rare and can occur from a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection in the esophagus. This type mostly affects people having weak immune systems. Among infections fungus called Candida albicans is common cause of this type. These fungal infections are common in people with low immunity, people who are diabetic, have cancer or those who use steroids. Its symptoms include difficulty swallowing, pain while swallowing, heartburn, pain in the chest behind the breastbone while eating, food getting stuck in the food pipe. Other symptoms that can occur includes nausea, vomiting, decrease in appetite, epigastric pain, sore throat, hoarse voice and cough. Young children may have feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. If not treated well in time there can occur changes in the structure and function of the esophagus. Firstly it can lead to scarring, narrowing (stricture) in the esophagus. Next there can occur ulcers in the esophagus. Another complication is tearing or perforation of the esophagus. Lastly it can lead to Barrett\u2019s esophagus (it is a precancerous condition in which there occurs damage to esophageal lining and changes in cells that line the esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal cancer). Homeopathy offers a very effective treatment for cases of esophagitis. Homeopathic medicines help to reduce the inflammation of esophagus and effectively manage its symptoms.

Albumin is a major type of protein made in the liver that normally circulates in the blood. Homeopathic medicines for albuminuria mainly play a supportive role in managing such cases. Albumin is the most abundant and significant protein in the blood circulation. It helps in maintaining the right amount of fluid flowing throughout the body and acts as a carrier for fatty acid, thyroid hormones and steroids. The protein should remain in blood and never enter urine under normal circumstances. But when the protein albumin abnormally seeps in the urine it is referred to as albuminuria. The kidneys function to filter the blood in the body. When blood passes through the kidneys it keeps the things required by the body like protein but eliminates the things not needed out of the body as urine. The kidneys have got glomeruli which act as filters. When functioning normally, the protein cannot pass through the filter and enter urine or a very little trace of protein can pass in urine. But in case of damaged kidney excessive albumin can leak out of the kidneys into urine. Some of the conditions that cause a temporary increase of albumin in urine includes dehydration, stress, intense physical activity, cold weather, fever and side effects of some medications. Furthermore, the medical conditions that can lead to rise of albumin levels in the urine. First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. Homeopathic medicines mainly play a supportive role in managing cases of albuminuria. These medicines can be used along with conventional treatment for halting its further progression. Additionally they help in reducing oedema (swelling ) linked with it. Other than these homeopathic medicines also work towards managing associated symptoms like burning / painful urine, frequent urine, scanty urine, kidney pain.

Severe angioedema may be a part of a dangerous medical condition called anaphylaxis needing emergency treatment. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction in which there appears swelling of lips, tongue and throat that blocks airways and leads to breathing problems, rapid heartbeat, sudden drop of blood pressure, dizziness and sometimes fainting. Anaphylaxis is a severe life threatening condition that should be urgently treated with conventional treatment. It most commonly arises from an allergic reaction and this type is known as allergic angioedema. The allergic reaction can occur from certain foods like eggs, peanuts, fish, shellfish and milk. This reaction can also occur from insect bites, pollen, animal dander, latex and poison ivy. The body detects a substance (like any of the above) as something dangerous. Following this there is release of histamine by the body that causes dilatation of the blood vessels and fluid leakage. In severe cases of allergic angioedema, anaphylaxis can occur with swelling of throat, difficulty in breathing and sudden drop in blood pressure. It is a medical emergency needing immediate medical help. It can also arise from the use of certain medicines called drug \u2013 induced angioedema.

Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Aggression in Kids \u2013 Homeopathy Can Help Some aggression and temper tantrums once in a while is normal in kids and is a normal part of a child\u2019s development. They are learning many sorts of new skills during their growth and development phase and can easily become frustrated trying to learn so many things and may blow out aggressively on occasions. With the use of homeopathic remedies for aggression in kids, a gradual decrease in the intensity and frequency of aggressive episodes has been noted. Kids are too young to learn how to control their impulse and have no understanding about which behaviour is right or wrong. A child in aggression may be disobedient, show temper tantrums, may get violent, hit or bite others, use bad language and cause destruction of things. As they grow they eventually outgrow it. But frequent aggressive behaviour which causes interference in school, results in hitting or harming children / adults or causes destruction of things need to be addressed by a doctor to find out if it\u2019s linked to some medical reason or not. Firstly there are certain environmental factors that influence a child and raises the risk of aggressive behaviour in a child. Stressful environment in family, living in environment where child abuse or spouse abuse occurs, where drugs / alcohol is used and socio \u2013 economic factors like poverty are some of the examples of these factors that put an impact on child\u2019s mind and result in aggressive behaviours. In some cases children may mimic aggressive behaviour of some of the family members or sometimes what they see on TV and may get adapted to this habit from there. They can also learn such behaviour from environment like neighbourhood, peers, teachers. Next history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, being got bullied or intense punishment to children can mark the beginning of aggressive and violent behaviour in them. Emotional factors like neglect from family, being raised by a single parent, being left in the hand of a caretaker by parents may also trigger such behaviour in children. Some of the disorders in children can have aggression as one of its attending symptoms. First among them is ADHD which refers to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder characterized by hyperactivity, difficulty in concentration, inattentiveness and impulsiveness. Usually it begins at the age of 3 to 6 yrs and sometimes may tend to continue into adulthood. Second is ODD that refers to oppositional defiant disorder. It is a behavioural disorder in which a child shows persistent patterns of anger, irritability and is argumentative, disobedient or shows vindictiveness towards authority figures. Third is BPD means Bipolar Disorder which is a psychological disorder in which a child has extreme mood swings from feeling high (excitement / mania phase) to feeling low (depression phase). In the excitement phase, a child is happy, shows high energy levels, is very restless, talkative, sleepless, and has aggressive, impulsive behaviour. The symptoms in the depressive phase include sadness, hopelessness, low energy levels, tiredness, loss of interest in daily activities, anxiety. Next is Asperger\u2019s syndrome that is a neurological disorder characterized by difficulties in communication and social interaction; and repetitive behaviour. Another is autism \u2013 a neurodevelopmental disorder occurring in early childhood. In this a child has difficulty with social communication and interaction and shows restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests. Last one is depression which is a psychological condition in which a person persistently feels excessively sad and has a low mood with no interest in doing any work. Other than above factors genetics also play a role in causing aggressive behaviour in children. Family history of aggression, antisocial behaviour raises risk of aggressive behaviour in children. History of brain injury is also linked with aggression in kids. Apart from above some ongoing emotional conflict in mind, lots of stress in early life, anxiety, suppressed emotions in children, frustration, feeling of helplessness in some situations, inability to verbalize the feelings can sometimes explode in aggression and violence when it is too much for a child to handle. Complaint of aggression in kids can be effectively managed with homeopathic medicines. Before giving any medicine it is very important to differentiate if the behaviour is indicating a normal part of a child\u2019s development or if some medical reason is linked with it that needs to be treated. \n\n Mild aggressive episodes that occur as a part of child development can be managed by parents themselves by teaching following a polite and calm approach and avoiding yelling, hitting or punishing. But when the aggression is intense and frequent that is interfering in school, causing destruction of things and harm to others then it needs to be evaluated by a doctor to find the reason behind it and treat it timely to stop it from getting worse. In such cases homeopathic medicines can be of great help. \n\n These medicines are selected individually for every case and work on the root cause behind it to manage this behaviour effectively. \n\n The symptoms of the child are the key to select the medicine that will suit him / her. The best thing about these medicines is that they are prepared from naturally occurring substances and don\u2019t cause any side effects and hence are very safe to use among children.

Since it is a serious condition that can have severe complications, homeopathic remedies for temporal arteritis should be considered along with conventional treatment Another name for this condition is giant cell arteritis. In this condition, when the cells of the inflamed arteries are looked under microscope they look giant that\u2019s why it is called giant cell arteritis. Though temporal arteritis most commonly affects temporal arteries but it can also occur in other arteries like thoracic arteries. Serious complications can occur in this condition if it is not treated quickly, so immediate medical help should be seeked in these cases. In this condition there occurs inflammation and swelling of the lining of arteries. As a result the blood vessels get narrow due to which there is a decrease in amount of blood flow to body tissues. When blood flow is reduced the tissues get deprived of oxygen and nutrients. It can occur in any medium or large artery but the most commonly involved artery is arteries in the temple region. The exact reason that leads to inflammation of arteries is not known yet. However it is thought that it occurs from autoimmune response of the body in which the immune cells of the body attack and inflame the walls of artery by mistake from a misdirected response. Other than this some genes and environmental factors are also thought to play a role that increase the risk of this condition. Next high doses of antibiotics and some intense infections are also associated with temporal arteritis. People above the age of 50 yrs are at more risk to develop this condition as compared to younger people. Females are also at more risk of it as compared to males.

First among them is sudden vision loss / blindness due to reduced blood flow to the eyes from narrow arteries.

It usually occurs in children between the ages of 3 months to 6yrs. They can be frightening but most times are harmless and don\u2019t point towards any serious health issue. Homeopathic Medicines for Febrile Seizures can be taken as a supportive help along with conventional mode of treatment. An increase of body temperature (mostly higher than 38 \u00b0C or 100.4 \u00b0F) usually can trigger a febrile seizure. Sometimes a low \u2013 grade fever can also trigger a febrile seizure. Most of the time the fever which lead to febrile seizures result from a viral infection and sometimes from bacterial infection. Virus which causes roseola ( also called as sixth disease is an infectious disease caused by human herpesvirus 6 and 7 and usually spreads through saliva. It occurs in children before age of three and causes fever and skin rash), chicken pox, influenza and upper respiratory tract infection that are accompanied with high fevers are mostly linked with febrile seizures. Other infections linked with febrile seizures are middle ear infections, shigellosis (an infection of intestines caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella) and salmonellosis (a bacterial disease caused by bacteria of the Salmonella type affecting the intestinal tract causing diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps). Next, fever that follows immunizations mainly the MMR (measles, mumps rubella vaccine), DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccine) can also cause febrile seizures. A child who has some family member having febrile seizure is at risk of it suggesting a link of genetics with this. These seizures mainly occur in children between the age group of 3 months and 6 years and the children between 12 months and 18 months of age are at the highest risk of it. In most cases febrile seizures don\u2019t cause any complication. But some children get the complication of recurrent febrile seizures. Few children who had a febrile seizure have a chance of getting another seizure from some future infection usually within the year of first seizure. The chances of recurrence is more if the first febrile seizure occurred before age of 18 months, the first febrile seizure occurred from a low fever, the time span between the fever onset and seizure was short and there is a family history of febrile seizures and if the child goes to day care that increase the chances to contract infections common in childhood like influenza, chicken pox.

Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin condition in which small, inflamed painful lumps form under the skin. The lumps can break open and release fluid or pus that can have an offensive smell. The tunnels can also form under the skin from connection of these lumps. This skin condition usually occurs in areas where the skin tends to rub together like in armpits, the area under breast or groin (the crease area where the upper part of the thigh and the lower part of the abdomen meet). Homeopathic Treatment for Hidradenitis Suppurativa helps in healing the lumps, nodules, cysts and boils in acute cases as well as chronic cases. This condition is also known as acne inversa. It is a non contagious condition which means it doesn\u2019t spread through direct skin to skin contact. The exact reason behind this condition is not yet clear. It is not caused by an infection and it doesn\u2019t arise from poor hygiene. This condition is known to begin from blockage of hair follicles. It is thought that genetics play a role in it as it is seen to run in families. Next hormonal changes are also thought to have a role in its development as it tends to start after puberty. Another factor that is linked with this condition is an overactive immune system that becomes over responsive to little infections in the clogged hair follicles. Apart from above other factors that are thought to be associated with development of it includes smoking, being overweight and having acne (pimples). Women are at more risk to develop this condition as compared to men. Having a family history of this condition also increases the risk. Persons in the age group of 20 to 39 yrs are at risk. In addition to above having there are certain medical conditions that raises its risk. The first among them is metabolic syndrome that refers to a group of five conditions which increases risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke. These conditions include increased blood pressure, excess fat around the waist, high blood sugar, high levels of triglyceride and low level of good cholesterol. The other two are diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a term to describe two disorders in which there occurs chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. First among these disorders is ulcerative colitis and another is crohn\u2019s disease. This condition can appear in one or several areas of the body. The most common areas involved in it includes armpits, area under breast, groin, inner thighs, anal area and between buttocks.

This condition may get worse from stress, being overweight, hormonal changes, heat and smoking. This condition is classified into three stages (called Hurley stages) depending upon its severity. Stage 1 \u2013 In this stage there is single or multiple nodules / boil with little scarring and no sinus tract Stage 2 \u2013 In this stage there are more than one bump with little scarring and limited tunnelling. Stage 3 \u2013 in this stage multiple bumps with extensive scarring and tunnelling appear involving entire area of the body In severe cases or the cases that are left untreated some complications can arise. First among them is infection on the affected skin area. Second is scarring / pitting on the healed part of skin and thickening of the scar. Next is restriction of movement from painful lesions and scar mainly when it affects the axilla. In some cases fistula ( a hollow passage) can form inside the body. Another complication is swelling in arms or legs when the lumps or scars (that occurs in body areas that are near lymph nodes) obstruct the drainage of lymph.

First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. Homeopathic medicines mainly play a supportive role in managing cases of albuminuria. These medicines can be used along with conventional treatment for halting its further progression. Additionally they help in reducing oedema (swelling ) linked with it.

They are learning many sorts of new skills during their growth and development phase and can easily become frustrated trying to learn so many things and may blow out aggressively on occasions. With the use of homeopathic remedies for aggression in kids, a gradual decrease in the intensity and frequency of aggressive episodes has been noted. Kids are too young to learn how to control their impulse and have no understanding about which behaviour is right or wrong. A child in aggression may be disobedient, show temper tantrums, may get violent, hit or bite others, use bad language and cause destruction of things. As they grow they eventually outgrow it. But frequent aggressive behaviour which causes interference in school, results in hitting or harming children / adults or causes destruction of things need to be addressed by a doctor to find out if it\u2019s linked to some medical reason or not. Firstly there are certain environmental factors that influence a child and raises the risk of aggressive behaviour in a child. Stressful environment in family, living in environment where child abuse or spouse abuse occurs, where drugs / alcohol is used and socio \u2013 economic factors like poverty are some of the examples of these factors that put an impact on child\u2019s mind and result in aggressive behaviours. In some cases children may mimic aggressive behaviour of some of the family members or sometimes what they see on TV and may get adapted to this habit from there. They can also learn such behaviour from environment like neighbourhood, peers, teachers. Next history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, being got bullied or intense punishment to children can mark the beginning of aggressive and violent behaviour in them. Emotional factors like neglect from family, being raised by a single parent, being left in the hand of a caretaker by parents may also trigger such behaviour in children. Some of the disorders in children can have aggression as one of its attending symptoms. First among them is ADHD which refers to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder characterized by hyperactivity, difficulty in concentration, inattentiveness and impulsiveness. Usually it begins at the age of 3 to 6 yrs and sometimes may tend to continue into adulthood. Second is ODD that refers to oppositional defiant disorder. It is a behavioural disorder in which a child shows persistent patterns of anger, irritability and is argumentative, disobedient or shows vindictiveness towards authority figures. Third is BPD means Bipolar Disorder which is a psychological disorder in which a child has extreme mood swings from feeling high (excitement / mania phase) to feeling low (depression phase). In the excitement phase, a child is happy, shows high energy levels, is very restless, talkative, sleepless, and has aggressive, impulsive behaviour. The symptoms in the depressive phase include sadness, hopelessness, low energy levels, tiredness, loss of interest in daily activities, anxiety. Next is Asperger\u2019s syndrome that is a neurological disorder characterized by difficulties in communication and social interaction; and repetitive behaviour. Another is autism \u2013 a neurodevelopmental disorder occurring in early childhood. In this a child has difficulty with social communication and interaction and shows restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests. Last one is depression which is a psychological condition in which a person persistently feels excessively sad and has a low mood with no interest in doing any work. Other than above factors genetics also play a role in causing aggressive behaviour in children. Family history of aggression, antisocial behaviour raises risk of aggressive behaviour in children. History of brain injury is also linked with aggression in kids. Apart from above some ongoing emotional conflict in mind, lots of stress in early life, anxiety, suppressed emotions in children, frustration, feeling of helplessness in some situations, inability to verbalize the feelings can sometimes explode in aggression and violence when it is too much for a child to handle. Complaint of aggression in kids can be effectively managed with homeopathic medicines. Before giving any medicine it is very important to differentiate if the behaviour is indicating a normal part of a child\u2019s development or if some medical reason is linked with it that needs to be treated. \n\n Mild aggressive episodes that occur as a part of child development can be managed by parents themselves by teaching following a polite and calm approach and avoiding yelling, hitting or punishing. But when the aggression is intense and frequent that is interfering in school, causing destruction of things and harm to others then it needs to be evaluated by a doctor to find the reason behind it and treat it timely to stop it from getting worse. In such cases homeopathic medicines can be of great help. \n\n These medicines are selected individually for every case and work on the root cause behind it to manage this behaviour effectively. \n\n The symptoms of the child are the key to select the medicine that will suit him / her.

Since it is a serious condition that can have severe complications, homeopathic remedies for temporal arteritis should be considered along with conventional treatment Another name for this condition is giant cell arteritis. In this condition, when the cells of the inflamed arteries are looked under microscope they look giant that\u2019s why it is called giant cell arteritis. Though temporal arteritis most commonly affects temporal arteries but it can also occur in other arteries like thoracic arteries. Serious complications can occur in this condition if it is not treated quickly, so immediate medical help should be seeked in these cases. In this condition there occurs inflammation and swelling of the lining of arteries. As a result the blood vessels get narrow due to which there is a decrease in amount of blood flow to body tissues. When blood flow is reduced the tissues get deprived of oxygen and nutrients. It can occur in any medium or large artery but the most commonly involved artery is arteries in the temple region. The exact reason that leads to inflammation of arteries is not known yet. However it is thought that it occurs from autoimmune response of the body in which the immune cells of the body attack and inflame the walls of artery by mistake from a misdirected response.

In PMR, pain and stiffness occurs mainly in the shoulders, arm, neck, thigh, hip and lower back. If this condition is not treated quickly then serious complications can occur. First among them is sudden vision loss / blindness due to reduced blood flow to the eyes from narrow arteries. Next complication is development of aortic aneurysm (enlargement and bulging of an artery from weakness in wall of artery.) This aortic aneurysm has chances to get burst and cause excessive internal bleeding which is life-threatening if not attended immediately.

It has multiple types and among them the most common form is AIDP (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy). In AIDP the protective covering of the nerves known as myelin sheath is damaged. Due to this damage the nerves are not able to send proper signals to the brain and weakness , numbness and paralysis can arise. It has been found that in most cases it occurs some days or weeks after a respiratory illness or a digestive tract infection. Persons of any age group can be affected with this but the risk increases with advancing age. Its chances are more in males as compared to females.

The lumps can break open and release fluid or pus that can have an offensive smell. The tunnels can also form under the skin from connection of these lumps. This skin condition usually occurs in areas where the skin tends to rub together like in armpits, the area under breast or groin (the crease area where the upper part of the thigh and the lower part of the abdomen meet). Homeopathic Treatment for Hidradenitis Suppurativa helps in healing the lumps, nodules, cysts and boils in acute cases as well as chronic cases. This condition is also known as acne inversa. It is a non contagious condition which means it doesn\u2019t spread through direct skin to skin contact. The exact reason behind this condition is not yet clear. It is not caused by an infection and it doesn\u2019t arise from poor hygiene. This condition is known to begin from blockage of hair follicles. It is thought that genetics play a role in it as it is seen to run in families. Next hormonal changes are also thought to have a role in its development as it tends to start after puberty. Another factor that is linked with this condition is an overactive immune system that becomes over responsive to little infections in the clogged hair follicles. Apart from above other factors that are thought to be associated with development of it includes smoking, being overweight and having acne (pimples). Women are at more risk to develop this condition as compared to men. Having a family history of this condition also increases the risk. Persons in the age group of 20 to 39 yrs are at risk. In addition to above having there are certain medical conditions that raises its risk. The first among them is metabolic syndrome that refers to a group of five conditions which increases risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke. These conditions include increased blood pressure, excess fat around the waist, high blood sugar, high levels of triglyceride and low level of good cholesterol. The other two are diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a term to describe two disorders in which there occurs chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. First among these disorders is ulcerative colitis and another is crohn\u2019s disease. This condition can appear in one or several areas of the body. The most common areas involved in it includes armpits, area under breast, groin, inner thighs, anal area and between buttocks. In case of hidradenitis suppurativa red, pimple \u2013 like bumps on skin, painful lumps, deep nodules (solid, elevated under the skin), cyst ( a lump containing fluid or other substance) under skin and boils ( pus filled bumps) can develop. The bumps can be itchy. The boil can drain fluid, pus or blood with an offensive smell. With passing time tunnels (sinus tract) that connect lumps may form under the skin. In this condition the lumps tend to occur on both sides of the body . The bumps keep going away and coming back. The bumps may occur on the same site every time or they may keep changing location. This condition may get worse from stress, being overweight, hormonal changes, heat and smoking. This condition is classified into three stages (called Hurley stages) depending upon its severity. Stage 1 \u2013 In this stage there is single or multiple nodules / boil with little scarring and no sinus tract Stage 2 \u2013 In this stage there are more than one bump with little scarring and limited tunnelling. Stage 3 \u2013 in this stage multiple bumps with extensive scarring and tunnelling appear involving entire area of the body In severe cases or the cases that are left untreated some complications can arise. First among them is infection on the affected skin area. Second is scarring / pitting on the healed part of skin and thickening of the scar. Next is restriction of movement from painful lesions and scar mainly when it affects the axilla. In some cases fistula ( a hollow passage) can form inside the body. Another complication is swelling in arms or legs when the lumps or scars (that occurs in body areas that are near lymph nodes) obstruct the drainage of lymph. Depression can occur in the person with this condition when they avoid going out in public and self isolate them due to draining from the lesion and offensive smell from it.
