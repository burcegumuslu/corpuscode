But while Biden\u2019s approach to the virus \u2014 frank warnings about the pandemic, mask mandates on federal property \u2014 is a reversal from Trump\u2019s policies, his administration\u2019s distribution of vaccines so far looks little different from that of its predecessor. Before Biden was sworn in, vaccines already were being delivered at a pace to meet his goal of 100 million doses in his first 100 days as president. The Biden administration has said they\u2019ll order new doses, but will do so by exercising options in contracts negotiated by the previous administration, which thought it premature to do so. They say they\u2019ll use the Defense Production Act, which Trump used repeatedly. Rather than a total overhaul, they have otherwise made course corrections and modest shifts. Data released Friday by Johnson & Johnson will fuel hopes that a third vaccine soon could hit the U.S. market. \u2013Bloomberg\n\nBiden \u2013 who has a history of plagiarism \u2013 was essentially lying, especially when one considers the mammoth effort involved in distribution efforts which would make major changes costly and risk setbacks to the program. adds that \u201csome aspects of the program don\u2019t offer much wiggle room to begin with, while the trickiest part are yet to come.\u201d\n\ndoes toss Biden a bone, however, reporting that Trump \u2018undercut\u2019 Biden\u2019s efforts to shape the program by delaying the transition while disputing the results of the election. Trump\u2019s team, however, says they had over 300 transition briefings with health officials \u2013 which Biden officials claim contained little useful information until just days before the inauguration.\n\nMeanwhile, officials from the Operation Warp Speed \u2013 the joint effort between the Trump administration\u2019s Departments of Health and Human Services and DoD, say the partisan sniping from Biden\u2019s team is hurting morale among career staff who are handling the vaccine rollout.\n\n\u201cThe transition is happening less well than I, and my team, had been hoping,\u201d said Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed. \u201cThe team doesn\u2019t understand why the Operation is being criticized as it is. It is so unfair and unjustified.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this Operation, we may not have as many vaccines as we will now.\u201d\n\nAlso pushing back against the Biden team\u2019s besmirchments is Anthony Fauci, the highest-paid employee in the federal government and ongoing COVID-19 advisor to the Office of the President.\n\n\u201cWe certainly are not starting from scratch,\u201d Fauci said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s taking what\u2019s gone on, but amplifying it in a big way,\u201d he added. Even Biden said that \u201ccredit is absolutely due\u201d to the Trump administration for launching the vaccine program.\n\nAccording to , \u201cBiden is endorsing federally run community vaccination centers and mobile clinics,\u201d and will attempt to provide states with a three-week supply, along with an increase in the number of people who can administer it. Trump officials, however, say the limitation is the number of vaccines, not healthcare professionals.\n\nBiden is also focusing on communities of color instead of devoting all resources to first vaccinating essential workers and those at most risk of dying from the virus. According to Biden, communities of color have been disproportionately affected by the virus.\n\nYet, most of the plan remains unchanged .\n\n[T]he biggest pieces of the distribution effort remain unchanged, undercutting claims from some Biden advisers that they inherited no plan. Many of the most stubborn bottlenecks don\u2019t stem from the federal government\u2019s decisions: Companies simply can\u2019t produce vaccines fast enough and supplies are scarce; even if distribution goes smoothly, the administration of doses gets backed up at the local level. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is them marching through the playbook of Operation Warp Speed,\u201d added Michael Pratt, a former Health and Human Services official under Trump. \u201cSomething cannot simultaneously be a dismal failure and have already accomplished the \u2018ambitious goal\u2019 you set.\u201d Nearly every industrialized nation has been beset by vaccine delays. The European Union has moved to restrict vaccine exports. The U.S. has administered 8.3 doses per 100 people, trailing the U.K. and Israel yet outpacing Germany, Canada, France and the EU overall, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Vaccine Tracker. \u2013Bloomberg\n\nThe Biden team has also retained many key Trump personnel, including the co-leader of Operation Warp Speed, General Gustave Perna.\n\nFurthermore, one of Biden\u2019s key tools to move quickly on the virus response is the use of the Defense Production Act to prioritize the availability of certain materials and supplies \u2013 which the Trump administration used extensively.\n\n\u201cIt is really incorrect to say there was no plan \u2014 because we\u2019re already achieving 1.3 million doses in arms per day, which exceeds the first goal President Biden had,\u201d said Brett Giroir, who led the Trump administration\u2019s program to ramp up widespread virus testing.\n\nOne wild card is whether another vaccine will hit the market anytime soon. Late Friday, Johnson & Johnson announced that its single-dose vaccine generated strong protection against COVID-19 in a large, late-stage trial. The company expects it to be \u2018quickly brought to market without the missed delivery timelines of the Pfizer shots.\u2019 If authorized for use, the J&J vaccine could allow the Biden team to reach 2 million total doses per day according to a former Trump official.\n\nAnd that\u2019s, the rest of the story\u2026\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 Biden Needs War On Iran To Address Internal Crises", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Biden Plagiarizes Again After Bloomberg Points Out Virus Plan Is Basically Trump's", "description": "Originally appeared at ZeroHedge While President Biden has done nothing but disparage President Trump\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination plan \u2013 while promising...", "url": "https://southfront.org/biden-plagiarizes-again-after-bloomberg-points-out-virus-plan-is-basically-trumps/", "site_name": "South Front", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontEnTwo", "article:published_time": "2021-02-01T09:30:50+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-01T09:31:08+00:00", "image": "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-13.jpg", "image:width": "665", "image:height": "340", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://southfront.org/donate/", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/biden-plagiarizes-again-after-bloomberg-points-out-virus-plan-basically-trumps", "https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/biden-counters-trump-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-plan-his-own", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/biden-covid-team-derides-trump-plan-while-borrowing-its-playbook?sref=ZMFHsM5Z", "https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/sad%20biden_3.jpg?itok=n4ViXrCj", "https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JNJ:US", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/biden-covid-team-derides-trump-plan-while-borrowing-its-playbook?sref=ZMFHsM5Z", "https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-06-11/biden-cant-stop-plagiarizing-time-rips-michael-avenatti-slogan?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "https://www.zerohedge.com/political/not-again-joe-biden-accused-plagiarizing-canadian-politician-dnc-speech", "https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/dr-anthony-fauci-highest-paid-employee-entire-us-federal-government", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/europe-opens-door-to-vaccine-export-ban-risking-global-backlash", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/biden-covid-team-derides-trump-plan-while-borrowing-its-playbook?sref=ZMFHsM5Z", "https://southfront.org/biden-needs-war-on-iran-to-address-internal-crises/", "https://southfront.org/white-house-briefings-for-children-jen-psaki-circles-back/", "https://southfront.org/donate/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-02-01T09:30:50+00:00"}
