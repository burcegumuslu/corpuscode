As it turns out, they also have ownership stakes in technology companies developing vaccine passports and digital wallets.\n\nCombined, BlackRock and Vanguard manage more than $15 trillion in global assets.\n\nTo put this figure into perspective, that amounts to more than three-fourths of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and more than triple the GDP of the European Union\u2019s economic powerhouse, Germany.\n\nBlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager, with more than $9.5 trillion in assets as of July 2021, while Vanguard held more than $7 trillion in assets as of January 2021.\n\nNotably, Vanguard is the largest stockholder in BlackRock (7.61%), while BlackRock is the biggest stockholder in Vanguard (13.06%) \u2014 though the actual ownership structure of these companies has been described as \u201cdark.\u201d\n\nIn an August 2021 article about the two firms, Dr. Joseph Mercola pointed out that, far from the appearance of competition promised by capitalism, BlackRock and Vanguard own significant shares in companies that ostensibly compete directly with each other, such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, or Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.\n\nThis influence extends to the media. BlackRock alone owns significant shares in supposed \u201ccompetitors\u201d such as Fox News, CBS, Comcast (NBC), CNN, Disney (ABC), Gannett (USA TODAY and 250 daily newspapers throughout the U.S.), Sinclair Media (whose television stations reach 72% of the American public), and the Graham Media Group (Slate, Foreign Policy).\n\nBlackRock is also politically influential and well-connected, having been chosen by the Obama administration to buy up toxic assets following the 2007-2008 financial collapse.\n\nIn 2020, BlackRock received a no-bid contract from the U.S. Treasury Department to manage a $454 billion fund, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), for businesses adversely impacted by the COVID lockdowns early that year. It wasn\u2019t the first time BlackRock had been granted a no-bid contract from the federal government.\n\nBlackRock along with other firms also is engaged in a real estate purchasing spree, buying up entire neighborhoods of single-family homes and converting them to rentals, driving up home prices by reducing supply on the marketplace.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s real estate strategy echoes the words of the World Economic Forum: \u201cYou\u2019ll own nothing, and you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nThis level of power and influence promoted none other than Bloomberg in 2020 to characterize BlackRock as the \u201cfourth branch of government.\u201d\n\nBlackRock, Vanguard among top 10 stockholders in most companies mandating vaccines\n\nIt is unclear to what extent BlackRock and Vanguard are able to dictate the vaccination policies of the companies in which they hold a stake \u2014 but what is clear is that the two investment firms are among the top 10 stockholders in most of these companies.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of major U.S. employers that continue to mandate COVID vaccines for their employers, and these companies\u2019 relationships with BlackRock and/or Vanguard (all ownership figures are accurate as of this writing):\n\u2022 Abbvie, a U.S.-based pharmaceutical company, mandated its employees either get vaccinated or undergo weekly tests and continue to follow anti-coronavirus measures.

(22nd, 1.1%), BioNTech (29th, 0.9%), Mastercard (39th, 0.6%), DoorDash (45th, 0.6%), Salesforce (53rd, 0.5%), and Lyft (93rd, 0.2%).\n\nBaillie Gifford, through its Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, also maintains a significant stake in Palantir (0.2% of the firm\u2019s net asset value, or NAV).\n\nAs reported by The Defender, Palantir developed the Tiberius vaccine allocation planning system operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nPeter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal (which terminated the contracts of nonprofits opposed to vaccine mandates) and a Facebook board member, also is a co-founder of Palantir and serves on its board of directors.\n\nPalantir\u2019s top two stockholders are Vanguard (6.08%) and BlackRock (3.31%).\n\nIn turn, the top stockholders of BioNTech, Pfizer\u2019s partner in the development of its COVID vaccine, include Baillie Gifford (biggest stockholder, 2.69%) and BlackRock (seventh highest, 0.59%), while Vanguard manages the top mutual fund with holdings in BioNTech (0.92%), and Baillie Gifford the ninth biggest (0.23%).\n\nBlackRock and Vanguard are poised to continue expanding\u2013 as far back as 2017, Bloomberg predicted that by 2028, these two companies would be managing $20 trillion worth of investments.\n\nThe size and scope of the firms\u2019 investments raise questions about how much influence BlackRock and Vanguard can wield over the formulation of corporate policies by the companies in which the two firms are heavily invested.\n\nThis ever-growing influence has led some analysts to describe the two firms as \u201ckingmakers,\u201d arguing their growing voting share in an increasing number of corporations would \u201chand them a de-facto veto on all major corporate decisions by 2040.\n\nTo what extent do companies mandating COVID vaccines have the best interest of their employees in mind? Or are these companies implementing policies under the guise of \u201cprotecting\u201d employees, when in fact they are more concerned about appeasing major investors?\n\nWhat else might these companies do, if \u201cencouraged\u201d in some way by major stockholders?\n\nMoreover, do mandatory (or strongly encouraged) vaccination policies reflect the worldview of funds such as BlackRock and Vanguard, and their managers \u2014 in much the same way major corporations have embraced purportedly \u201cgreen\u201d policies which only barely cloak potentially totalitarian restrictions on civil liberties, such as \u201cpersonal carbon allowances\u201d and digital \u201cvaccine passports\u201d?\n\nThe answers may lie, in part, in the words of BlackRock CEO and chairman, Larry Fink.\n\nIn his 2022 annual letter to CEOs, Fink wrote that \u201cemployees are increasingly looking to their employer as the most trusted, competent and ethical source of information \u2014 more so than government, the media and NGOs.\u201d\n\nFink said, \u201cworkers demanding more from their employers is an essential feature of effective capitalism\u201d \u2014 an interesting viewpoint given that the BlackRock and Vanguard strategy to control as many corporations as possible, including competing ones, would seem to contradict the principles of capitalism, competition, and a free market.\n\nFink also warned that \u201ccompanies not adjusting to this new reality and responding to their workers do so at their own peril.\u201d\n\nIn other words, employees and workers of companies that have imposed vaccine mandates should take comfort in such policies, as their employer appears to know what\u2019s best for them \u2014 at least according to Fink.", "opengraph": {"title": "Corporate Vaccine Mandates and
