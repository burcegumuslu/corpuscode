I\u2019m sort of the leftist version of \u201canti-vaxer\u201d in that I\u2019m worried about weird chemicals entering my body. I\u2019m NOT worried that Bill Gates is evil and wants to take over the planet and install a new world order of the devil. It\u2019s really just for health issues. I mean, isn\u2019t fighting viruses supposed to be tackling the root issues like bad eating habits, leading a sedentary lifestyle, shallow breathing, the stressful lives we lead in modern times, wrong thought patterns etc etc. Isn\u2019t tackling those root issues better than being injected with chemicals? Or is all I\u2019m saying just stage green, hippie nonsense and vaccines are actually extremely important and necessary? What do you think?\n\nmean, isn\u2019t fighting viruses supposed to be tackling the root issues like bad eating habits, leading a sedentary lifestyle, shallow breathing, the stressful lives we lead in modern times, wrong thought patterns etc etc. This isn't left-wing. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's not even stupid. Most stupid people do not believe this sort of thing. It's simply ignorance. Obviously I've \"taken\" vaccines against viruses before, and would again.\n\nDefinitely don't be getting common flu vaccines every year. That's just silly. Vaccines should be for the most serious diseases. And you can follow them up with a mercury detox protocol. It should only be a problem when you have no detox protocols. You are God. You are Love. You are Infinity. You are Leo.\n\nMercury in vaccines is definitely not good for your brain health. This is not speculation. It is obvious as day. No amount of mercury is good. But you must weigh this against the risks and dangers of catching the virus. I'm sure the side effects of traces of mercury from a dose of a vaccine would be completely negligible and absolutely impossible to notice in day to day life. There are a million other things about diet and health to manage that have MUCH more immediate impact on quality of life. Even just the reality of living in a city for most people shortens their life span via damaged/weakened lungs to pollution, or drinking alcohol, smoking, etc. Obvious dangers that most people completely take for granted. If I gotta take a needle to protect me 90% + from a once in lifetime pandemic disease, I'm gonna take it. I'm not sure why everyone would be more terrified of a vaccine than the disease itself which is well on it's way to upwards of killing 5+ million people. Wouldn't NOT taking it be irresponsible and low consciousness? You're basically keeping yourself a vector for the spread of the virus, endangering other people. \" Given enough explosives any moron can blow up a building, don't YOU wanna be that moron ?\"\n\nI'm sure the side effects of traces of mercury from a dose of a vaccine would be completely negligible and absolutely impossible to notice in day to day life. Don't be so sure about that. There might be a lot of mercury in there and it goes straight into your veins and brain. It really depends on how well your body is able to naturally detox it. Genetics determines how well people are able to detox mercury. Some people can detox 90% of mercury. Others only 10%. You'd want to check your genes for the MTHFR mutations. Wouldn't NOT taking it be irresponsible and low consciousness? You're basically keeping yourself a vector for the spread of the virus, endangering other people. Not if it hurts your brain. You can't assume everyone is the same. It depends on your health condition. @Leo Gura would you get the coronavirus vaccine I'm unsure. I have serious health problems due to poor natural detox functions due to genetics and other factors. So I am not a good typical example. If I take it I will doing some serious detoxing immediately afterward. Usually I would not touch anything with heavy metals in it. But Covid is an exceptional case which needs to be taken seriously. You are God. You are Love. You are Infinity. You are Leo.\n\nThat\u2019s crazy. I grew up in U.K. and only recall About 3 vaccines as a kid, no idea what I had as a baby. We only got the serious ones. Maybe it\u2019s changed now? That was the 90s tbf. I remember that the last vaccine I was supposed to get was when I was 14/15 and the BCG one. Anyway, I was sick that day so I missed the vaccination. My mam planned to give me it at home (she\u2019s a nurse) but then life happened and we forgot about it. So I never got that one. whether I take the corona depends on if it\u2019s a one time vaccine or a yearly one. I don\u2019t like the idea of taking something every year that may or may not work. Like the flu shot. People I know that I took the flu shot got real sick afterwards, and they had never been that sick before. I\u2019m all for the vaccines for serious diseases. If I were to travel to a country which was a high risk for certain diseases I would take the necessary injections before going. But I believe first and foremost health and immunity should be stronger and there needs to be more emphasis on that in society, for young and old. Not just masking symptoms with a vaccine. \n\n Older people especially don\u2019t know how to strengthen their immune system. I\u2019m telling my mam all the time different foods to eat and what she should avoid, she is clueless when it comes to mind & body health. I don\u2019t know enough about corona and the vaccine yet to decide if I would get one.", "opengraph": {"image":
