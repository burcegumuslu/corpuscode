The available COVID-19 vaccines have performed increasingly worse against Omicron and its subvariants, providing little or even negative protection against infection and quickly waning shielding against severe disease.Swiss authorities nodded to the short-lived protection as they noted that people designated at high risk from COVID-19 can still receive a vaccine, despite the lack of recommendation, after consultation with their doctor.People at high risk include those aged 65 or older and pregnant women.In cases where a doctor recommends a vaccine, a shot should be given at least six months after the last shot or at least six months after the last known COVID-19 infection.Because the vaccines are no longer being recommended, they're no longer covered by the government. Instead, people will have to pay a fee to get vaccinated.People who aren't determined to be at high risk from COVID-19 can also get a COVID-19 vaccine but will have to pay a fee since they're getting a vaccine that isn't recommended, authorities said. Those at high risk who receive a shot recommended by the doctor won't have to pay, as the vaccination will be covered by health insurance.The move by Switzerland follows a number of other countries that have stopped recommending COVID-19 vaccination for many people.The World Health Organization in March stated that countries should consider factors such as cost-effectiveness when boosting certain populations, including healthy children, considering the \"low burden of disease\" presently seen.Some countries, including the United States, continue advising a primary series for all unvaccinated,", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/479152-Switzerland-stops-recommending-COVID-19-vaccination", "type": "website", "title": "Switzerland stops recommending COVID-19 vaccination -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/675734/full/id5180875_GettyImages_12372260.jpg", "description": "Swiss authorities have stopped recommending COVID-19 vaccination, including for people who are designated at high risk from COVID-19.
