When number nine follows you wherever you go, you know the angels are sending you a wonderful, positive message.Whilst we all have many purposes for which we are on Earth, many of us have specific work that we are skilled in to complete whilst here. A sequence of nines informs us that we are gearing up to find or recognise our true life purpose, which may either be spiritual in nature or else help mankind, animals or the environment. Our life purpose is as unique as we are ourself and is our sacred contribution to this world, the one we are born to do.As we approach the realisation of what this purpose is, or indeed have already received a hint of it, we begin to finish up other activities to make room for this new direction. Seeing 999 indicates that natural endings are occurring in our life or work. This number is higher guidance from angels who are confirming that you are ready to begin the new path, and that as you get started, fears and doubts can more easily melt away. This is particularly true of lightworkers who stand ready to step into their light more forcefully and more tangibly in this world.Many people will also find a place of leadership when they follow their soul purpose, which can be a natural consequence.If your angels keep giving you this sign, then your angel team is certainly ready to help you open doors to where you need to go. Don't fear stepping out of the old and into the new. Keep asking for signs towards what you could be doing next and listen quietly to what the angels tell you. 999 is an excellent sign, and the angels would not provide this if you weren't ready, willing and capable to move onto your new joyous path!", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/articles/spiritual/lightworker-traits.php", "/psychic/numbers/what-are-angel-numbers.php", "/psychic/numbers/reading-angel-numbers.php", "/psychic/numbers/777.php", "/psychic/numbers/777.php", "/psychic/numbers.888.php", "/psychic/numbers/777.php", "http://www.askingangels.com", "/spirit/portal-of-light-activation.php", "/healing/health/the-nuremberg-trials.php", "/articles/angels/incarnated-angels.php", "/articles/spiritual/twin-flame-love.php", "/articles/starseeds/negative-ets.php", "/articles/angels/ascendedmasters.php", "/psychic/numbers/what-are-angel-numbers.php", "/healing/healer-signs.php", "/articles/spiritual/soulmates-types.php", "/psychic/cutcords.php", "/articles/spiritual/ascension-symptoms.php", "/psychic/signs/feather-angel-sign.php", "/psychic/signs/butterfly-angel-sign.php", "/psychic/signs/rose-scent.php", "/psychic/signs/angel-wings-meaning.php", "/articles/angels/askformoney.php", "/psychic/energy-vampire.php", "/articles/interpreting-signs.php", "/psychic/areyoupsychic.php", "/psychic/four-clairs.php", "/articles/spiritual/spiritual-awakening.php", "/psychic/empath-signs.php", "/articles/spiritual/twin-flame-telepathy.php", "/healing/kundalini-awakening.php", "/psychic/spiritual-grounding.php", "/articles/starseeds/starseed.php", "/psychic/protection.php", "/articles/spiritual/lightworker-missions.php", "/articles/angels/names.php", "/articles/spiritual/twin-flame-meetings.php", "/articles/spiritual/twin-flame-separation.php", "/articles/spiritual/soulmates-signs.php", "/articles/spiritual/lightworker-traits.php", "/spirit/meditations/love-meditation.php", "/healing/earth/incarnated-elementals.php", "http://askingangels.com/articles.php"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
