The country awaits an executive order for its implementation.\n\nWhile the President expresses optimism over the proposal, the Department of Health and other authorities demonstrate reluctance to lift this health protocol which comes from a flawed scientific reference on the effectiveness of face masks against viral transmission.\n\nIt should be recalled that since the onset of the pandemic, people have been religiously wearing the face mask (others even wore two or more at a time), but that did not prevent the rise in the so-called \u201cCOVID-19 confirmed cases\u201d. Now, with a reported average of daily cases at 0.017% of the total population, what other evidence is necessary to justify the lifting of the use of face mask?\n\nThe Philippines is among the remaining countries to impose mandatory wearing of face mask in both indoor and outdoor areas.\n\n*\n\n Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
