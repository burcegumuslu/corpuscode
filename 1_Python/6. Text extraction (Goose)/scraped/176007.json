A total of 15 players were unable to finish, including the male and female favourites to win.\n\nThe tennis world reacted with shock after favourites Paula Badosa and Jannik Sinner had to retire during the quarterfinals of the Miami Open. Badosa, soon to be the number three in the world, became unwell during her match against Jessica Pegula and left the court in tears. Badosa, who was comforted by her American opponent, decided to stop after consultation with her physiotherapist. Pegula reached the semifinals of the Miami tennis tournament for the first time in her career after Badosa\u2019s resignation, reported Yahoo Sports. In the men\u2019s tournament, the Italian phenomenon Jannik Sinner was forced to withdraw. He gave up after 22 minutes in the game against Francisco Cerundolo, the number 103 in the world ranking. \u201cWhen I served at 3-1 and 30-0, I saw him bend over. It was very strange,\u201d Cerundolo said during an interview. \u201cI hope he\u2019s okay, he\u2019s a great player.\u201d The 23-year-old Argentinian surprisingly reached the semifinals with his first participation in the master tournament in Miami. It was the second game in a row that ended prematurely for the tennis fans. Fans reacted with shock to the bizarre tennis day. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d someone asked.\n\nNobody is pointing to the obvious. All of the players must be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d in order to compete. Just as we\u2019ve noted for several months, most major sports have been hit with \u201cinexplicable\u201d medical conditions popping up in young and otherwise healthy athletes, including our report that three cyclists fell in March alone.\n\nFolks, this is the jab. There is no other viable possibility, especially when we consider how even the CDC and other agencies have acknowledge the Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d cause increases in heart problems for young people, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and heart attacks.\n\nThere has never been as much gaslighting and propaganda geared towards covering up the truth than with these injections. Leaders across the country and around the world have so much wrapped into the vaccines, one has to wonder who\u2019s pulling the strings. Some of it is personal; any politician who comes out with the truth about the jabs will be pushed out of office faster than Will Smith\u2019s exit from Hollywood\u2019s elite club. The same is true for journalists. Corporate media is just as invested and possibly even more complicit in spreading the lies.\n\nBut it may be worse than that. Like so many things we\u2019ve witnessed over the last three years, there appears to be a coordinated effort to suppress the truth. Pandemic Panic Theater is still in action despite the odd February push by Democrats to lift most face mask and vaccine mandates. There are already talks of 5th and 6th jabs even as the 4th jab gets rolled out in the United States.\n\nIs this all part of The Great Reset agenda? Is it all about control? Depopulation? The answer to all three questions is very likely, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThese injections are dangerous. Athletes across the globe are falling. Average people are experiencing horrible adverse reactions. Tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people are dying from them. It could even be millions; the data is so obscured. All the while, politicians and corporate media are pretending it all away is if there\u2019s nothing to see here.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Health and Welfare"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://freewestmedia.com/2022/04/02/tennis-world-shocked-after-scores-of-players-drop-out-of-miami-open/", "https://endmedicaltyranny.substack.com/p/march-was-not-a-good-month-for-vaccinated", "https://thelibertydaily.com/buried-bombshell-tennis-world-rocked-as-fifteen-fully-vaccinated-players-unable-to-finish-miami-open/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
