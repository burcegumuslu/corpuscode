Local health officials are carrying out contact tracing in the meantime, they said.\n\nHealth officials said masks were effective at preventing the spread of monkeypox, which produces skin lesions and leaves patients with flu symptoms.\n\n\u201cAs a precaution, any New Yorkers who experience flu-like illness with swelling of the lymph nodes and rashes on the face and body should contact their health care provider,\u201d New York City health officials wrote in a press release.\n\n\u201cMonkeypox is rare but can spread through close contact with an infected person or animal. This includes via respiratory droplets \u2013 usually after prolonged contact \u2014 body fluids or other forms of close contact, such as sharing clothes or other materials that have been used by someone who is infectious.\u201d\n\nNew York City health officials stated monkeypox call be spread through \u201crespiratory droplets.\u201dCynthia S. Goldsmith, Russell Regner/CDC via APThe World Health Organization called an emergency meeting Friday after more than 100 confirmed or suspected cases were identified in Europe, along with cases in Canada and Australia.\n\nThe virus was first identified in monkeys and rarely spreads outside of Africa, which has made the latest rash of cases alarming to health officials.\n\nThe first signs of the new outbreak started on May 7 when a man who had been in Nigeria tested positive for the virus in England.\n\nOfficials in England and Portugal have said most patients in their country are men who have sex with other men.\n\nThe cluster of cases was classified as an epidemic, according to Dr. Fabian Leendertz, a Robert Koch Institute epidemiologist.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is very unlikely that this epidemic will last long. The cases can be well isolated via contact tracing and there are also drugs and effective vaccines that can be used if necessary,\u201d he said.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["corona virus", "air combat usa", "#JOEIMBRIANO", "Doug Chaffee", "Las Vegas Shooting", "The DCCSP", "joe imbriano for city council", "illegal immigration", "MONKEYPOX", "Jesus Silva", "greg seabourn", "Fullerton city council", "Greg Sebourn", "Troy High School", "Bruce Whitaker Fullerton", "wifi dangers", "5G", "BRUCE WHITAKER", "JOE IMBRIANO", "Tony Bushala", "Hunt Library", "tony bushala fullerton", "Bruce Whitaker for senate", "barry levinson", "Friends for Fullertons Future", "Travis kiger", "doug chafee", "greg seaborn", "Larry Bennett", "Jim Touchstone", "fullertons sex offender ordinace repeal", "Joe Felz", "Joe Felz Dan Hughes bruce whitaker jennifer fitzgerald", "ladera vista junior high", "kelly thomas", "shawn nelson", "5G DANGERS", "corruption in the fullerton police department", "dan hughes", "Gretchen Cox", "Josh Newman", "ED ROYCE", "obstruction of justice", "jennifer fitzgerald", "Sean Paden", "jennifer Fitzgherald"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://nypost.com/tag/monkeypox/", "https://nypost.com/2022/06/15/who-investigating-claims-that-monkeypox-found-in-semen/", "https://nypost.com/2022/06/14/who-renaming-monkeypox-after-experts-say-name-could-be-stigmatizing/", "https://nypost.com/2022/06/14/who-committee-to-decide-if-monkeypox-is-emergency-of-international-concern/", "https://nypost.com/2022/06/14/kids-immune-systems-weakened-after-covid-lockdowns/", "https://nypost.com/2022/05/19/possible-case-of-monkeypox-investigated-in-nyc/", "https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/press/2022/05202022-monkeypox-update.pdf", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/nyc-monkeypox-111.jpg", "https://nypost.com/2022/05/20/who-convening-emergency-meeting-on-monkeypox/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
