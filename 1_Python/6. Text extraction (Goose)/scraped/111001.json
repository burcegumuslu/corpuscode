Bridgen was speaking briefly (3 minutes) at a Truth Be Told rally this past weekend, which took place outside the BBC studios in London.\n\nHere is the site link: https://covileaks.co.uk/awareness-month. Of note:\n\nThe purpose of this campaign is to raise awareness about the damage, including life changing injuries and fatalities as a direct result of the COVID-19 Vaccines; with a view to support various groups in their missions and campaigns. We need to change the public perception that is a result of mainstream media suppression of facts. Most importantly we intend to give a voice to the injured and bereaved. Here you will find information on our COVID Vaccine Victim Awareness Month and how you can get involved.\n\nOther short speeches at last weekend\u2019s Truth Be Told rally can be found here on Rumble at the Oracle Films channel:\n\nThe Liberty Beacon Project is now expanding at a near exponential rate, and for this we are grateful and excited! But we must also be practical. For 7 years we have not asked for any donations, and have built this project with our own funds as we grew. We are now experiencing ever increasing growing pains due to the large number of websites and projects we represent. So we have just installed donation buttons on our websites and ask that you consider this when you visit them. Nothing is too small.
