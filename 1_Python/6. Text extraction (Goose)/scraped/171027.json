Farmers raise crops with science; they hybridize them and make them better with every generation. That's all evolution. Evolution is a theory, and it's a theory that you can test. We've tested evolution in many ways. You can't present good evidence that says evolution is not a fact,\" he said.1\n\nBut not all scientists agree with him.\n\n\"Bill Nye makes two fundamental errors in his lament: Confusing 'evolution' with 'science,' and confusing small observable changes in a kind or species with unobservable changes of one kind of creature into another,\" commented Nathaniel Jeanson, who obtained his Ph.D. in cell and developmental biology from Harvard University. \"Both errors hide essentially the same fact: Evolution in the molecules-to-man science is not and cannot be observed; therefore, it is not science and is not validated by observing small changes within a kind of creature or species.\"\n\nWhen asked whether teachers should be \"mandated\" to teach evolution as fact, Nye said, \"What other fundamental theory in all of biology is there? Intelligent design, as the judge in Dover, Penn., said, is 'breathtaking inanity.' It was so stupid it took his breath away. I agree with him. It's great to teach in history class...but we don't learn about those ideas in science class.\"1\n\nNeither should students learn about the theory of evolution in science education, Jeanson said.\n\n\"Science is fundamentally about observation; science class should be filled with observations. Speculations about the unobservable past do not belong in the science class; therefore, 'evolution' in the big change sense does not belong in the science class, either.\"\n\nWhen it comes to teaching biology, evolution doesn't fit the bill.\n\u2022 Fecht, S.
