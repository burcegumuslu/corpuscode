Well, this guy gets to experience it first-hand.\n\nA TikToker recently revealed what it\u2019s like to be raised by a mother who truly believes in the QAnon conspiracy theories, Unilad reports.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the QAnon concept, as described by BBC, it is a wide-ranging, completely unfounded theory that says that President Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping pedophiles in government, business, and the media. The movement started after claims made by an anonymous person known as \u201cQ\u201d went viral.\n\nMac, the guy whose mom is a supporter of these conspiracy theories, posted a video with the caption: \u201cpov: u have a mom who is in QAnon\u201d\n\nIn the clip, Mac shares some of the texts his mother sends him, as well as conspiracy-based memes about COVID-19, vaccines, and other topics that trigger the QAnon community. Some of the messages the TikToker has received from his mom say things like: \u201cDo not get vaccinated Mac\u201d and \u201cDo not drink tap water.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, one of the pictures shows a bacteria-filled petri dish, with the claim that these are the germs that build up inside a face mask after only 20 minutes of use.\n\nMany of the 3.5 million viewers who saw the video sympathized with Mac in the comment section.\n\nOne person said: \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to maintain a loving and respectful relationship when they\u2019ve become all but brainwashed like this.\u201d\n\nAnother questioned: \u201cIs there a support group for this?\u201d\n\nA third one, who shares the same fate as Mac, wrote: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m slowly watching my mom lose her sanity.\u201d\n\nDo you know someone who believes the QAnon theories? Are you a supporter of the movement?
