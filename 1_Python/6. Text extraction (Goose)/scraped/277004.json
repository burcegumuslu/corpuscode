At midnight, capacity limits will be removed for smaller venues, including libraries and places of worship with a capacity of less than 500. Food and beverage consumption will be allowed in venues where audiences are seated. Facilities with a capacity of 500 to 1,000 will continue to be limited to 500, while facilities with capacity for 1,000-plus people will be limited to 50 per cent. Step 2 comes into effect on March 1, if hospitalization numbers continue to trend down. Those changes include:\n\u2022 Any remaining provincial school requirements (including cohorting) will be removed.\n\u2022 Screening prior to youth activities will no longer be required.\n\u2022 Capacity limits will be lifted for all venues.\n\u2022 Limits on social gatherings will be removed. The timing of Step 3 will be determined by hospitalization rates, Kenney said. This phase will see COVID-specific measures in continuing care removed and mandatory isolation becoming a recommendation only.\n\nCoutts border blockaders were not happy with premier Jason Kenney\u2019s announcement today and demanded he lift all restrictions permanently.\n\nAlberta is the latest Canadian province to lift Covid restrictions.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Saskatchewan announced it will end its vaccine passport system on Monday, February 14.\n\nThe province\u2019s mask mandate will also be lifted at the end of February.\n\n\u201cWe want things to be as normal as they can,\u201d Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said on Tuesday.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Canada: Alberta Premier Ends Covid Vaccine Passport System \u2013 Effective Tonight at Midnight", "description": "(Cristina Laila)\u00a0Canada \u2013 Alberta Premier Jason Kenney on Tuesday announced the end to his province\u2019s Covid vaccine passport system, effective tonight at midnight.", "url": "https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2022/02/canada-alberta-premier-ends-covid-vaccine-passport-system-effective-tonight-at-midnight/", "site_name": "Stillness in the Storm", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/stillnessinthestorm", "article:published_time": "2022-02-09T16:21:19+00:00", "image": "https://stillnessinthestorm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/FLHUZ6eX0AYOQX2.jpg", "image:width": "680", "image:height": "382", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Covid Vaccine Passport System", "Premier", "news", "canada", "The Gateway Pundit", "video", "Alberta"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Breaking: Alberta\u2019s proof-of-vaccination program is ending tonight, Premier Jason Kenney announces.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ableg</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19Ab?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19Ab</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bGdLrMSVsU\">pic.twitter.com/bGdLrMSVsU</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Sammy Hudes (@SammyHudes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SammyHudes/status/1491206676749430789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Coutts border blockaders were not happy with the announcement by Jason Kenney today, updates sure to come soon.</p>\n<p>Help their legal defence at <a href=\"https://t.co/FgSvcLfPNy\">https://t.co/FgSvcLfPNy</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JD2Xo9bIig\">pic.twitter.com/JD2Xo9bIig</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Syd Fizzard (@SydFizzard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SydFizzard/status/1491212969568780288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://stillnessinthestorm.com/health/", "https://stillnessinthestorm.com/health/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19Ab?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/bGdLrMSVsU", "https://twitter.com/SammyHudes/status/1491206676749430789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid-alta-edmonton-kenney-1.6343576", "https://t.co/FgSvcLfPNy", "https://t.co/JD2Xo9bIig", "https://twitter.com/SydFizzard/status/1491212969568780288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/02/canada-saskatchewan-end-covid-19-proof-vaccination-february-14/"], "authors": ["Stillness in the Storm"], "publish_date": "2022-02-09T16:21:19+00:00"}
