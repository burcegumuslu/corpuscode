Despite their success, producers of the unusual concoction have hesitated to try it, citing concerns about its safety.\n\nThe so-called prehistoric \u201cmammoth meatball\u201d has been manufactured by the Australian \u201ccellular meat\u201d company, Vow. This culinary conundrum will be displayed this Thursday at the Nemo Science Museum in the Netherlands.\n\nIn this seemingly sci-fi experiment, scientists extracted the DNA from an ancient mammoth, a beast that went extinct some 10,000 years ago, and combined it with genetic material from an elephant. This hybrid DNA sequence , that shouldn't rightfully be called a mammoth, was then set in myoblast stem cells from a sheep.\n\nThe experiment produced approximately 20 billion cells that were then used to cultivate what some are calling mammoth meat. However, according to a report in the Daily Mail , the producers \u201care too afraid to eat it in case the ancient protein proves deadly.\u201d In other word, there are concerns that the mammoth meatball may be harmful.\n\nThis Is Not A \u201cMammoth Meatball\u201d\n\nProfessor Ernst Wolvetang of the Australian Institute for Bioengineering at the University of Queensland , was the brainchild behind the supposed \"mammoth meatball.\u201d He explained that his team of scientists took the DNA sequence from mammoth muscle protein, known as myoglobin.\n\nDistantly related to haemoglobin, Myoglobin, is an iron and oxygen-binding protein that is found in the skeletal muscle tissue of vertebrates and most mammals. According to Wolvetang, gaps in the mammoth DNA were \u201cfilled in\u201d with DNA coding from the mammoth's close living relative, the African elephant.\n\nFinally, this new DNA sequence was placed into a sheep's stem cells and the genetic soup produced around 20 billion copies that were then used to make the ill-named \u201cmammoth meatball.\u201d However, this is \u201cnot\u201d a mammoth meatball. It is a sheep and elephant meatball, built on mammoth DNA.\n\nThe mammoth is an extinct species of elephant that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. Now scientists have used ancient mammoth DNA, combined with other genetic material, and created what has been dubbed a mammoth meatball . ( WILD HARE / Adobe Stock)\n\nProfessor Wolvetang told The Guardian that the process of making the mammoth meatball was completed in a \u201ccouple of weeks,\u201d a time frame which he described as \u201cridiculously easy and fast.\u201d However, he warned that because the meat was thrown together so quickly \u201cwe have no idea how our immune system would react\u201d if it was eaten by a human.\n\nWolvetang stated that if his team were to produce additional mammoth meat products, they would ensure they were \u201cmore palatable to regulatory bodies.\u201d It is worth noting that he referred specifically to regulatory bodies, rather than consumers' bodies.\n\nThe team actually set out to reintroduce dodo meat. According to a 2003 estimate published in Nature, this flightless bird went extinct at the end of the 17th century. But lacking dodo DNA, the team abandoned this quest, and the idea to create a \u201cmammoth meatball\u201d came from Bas Korsten, at creative agency Wunderman Thompson.\n\nThe \u2018mammoth meatball\u2019 was unveiled at in the Netherlands. ( studioaico/ Wunderman Thompson )\n\nAccording to Vow, the company's overarching goal is \u201cto demonstrate the potential of meat grown from cells as an alternative to the slaughter of animals.\u201d Furthermore, Vow associates global warming with large-scale livestock production. The company explained that they chose \u201cmammoth meat,\u201d even though it isn\u2019t mammoth meat, because the mammoth \u201cis a symbol of diversity loss and a symbol of climate change .\u201d\n\nThe internet is full of scientists claiming \u201cmeat without slaughter,\u201d or lab grown meat consumption is inevitable, because cultivated meats use much less water and land than livestock. Lab grown meat also produces no methane emissions.\n\nHowever, these tropes are becoming widely contested by sceptical researchers. \u201cSplashy headlines have long overshadowed inconvenient truths about biology and economics,\u201d decried a 2021 article in The Counter . Now, extensive new research suggests the cellular meat industry may be on a \u201cbillion-dollar crash course with reality.\u201d But, why?\n\n\u201cMost of us have a limited appetite for 50-dollar lab-grown chicken nuggets,\u201d stressed The Counter . Meanwhile the Food Health Agency has explained that \u201cunlike animals, cells do not have a fully functioning immune system, so there is a high likelihood of bacterial or fungal growth, mycoplasma, and other human pathogens growing in vats of cells.\u201d Because this science is so new, there are no long-term trials to support spurious claims that these food products would be safe and healthy for human consumption.\n\nTransitioning, No Matter What the Human Cost Might Be\n\nIn this most recent attempt, lab-grown meat companies, which is also known as cultured meat, aimed to produce palatable mammoth meat. But some producers remain hesitant to consume it due to concerns that the ancient protein could be harmful to humans. Notwithstanding, some lab-grown meat companies, including the California-based Upside Foods , have passed the approval process for their product in the United States.\n\u2022 Mammoth Hybrid To Be Made Using Asian Elephants\n\nGeorge Peppou, who Ted Talks describe as \u201ca serial entrepreneur and inventor, with over 30 patents granted,\u201d is co-founder and CEO of food-tech startup Vow. \u201cThe goal is to transition a few billion meat eaters away from eating [conventional] animal protein to eating things that can be produced in electrified systems,\u201d explained Peppou in The Guardian .\n\nHowever, before transitioning billions of traditional meat eaters, perhaps this serial entrepreneur should himself be a part of the human trials for his own self-proclaimed \u201cdeadly\u201d mammoth meatball. But then again, it isn\u2019t really a \u201cmammoth meatball.\u201d Maybe it should be named after what it really is; a \u201cpotentially deadly fusion of mammoth DNA, blended with elephant and sheep.\u201d Although this may not be quite as catchy.\n\nThis prehistoric monster mammoth meatball is not only a threat to our future children\u2019s health. It\u2019s also a hazard to more than 570 million farms worldwide, of which more than 90% are run by families who produce about 80% of the world's food today, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations .\n\nTop image: An Australian lab-grown meat company has created a so-called mammoth meatball made using mammoth DNA.
