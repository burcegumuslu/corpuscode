It\u2019s extremely tedious to deal with because it does not give you a moment of respite.\n\nNormally your first reaction is to immediately go to the doctor and get antibiotics to treat the infection.\n\nThe problem is not if they work or not; the issue is that we\u2019re using them when there is no immediate need to.\n\nThe crisis we\u2019re facing is how short-term issues are taking a priority over long-term concerns.\n\nIts main issue is that antibiotics do not discriminate and they will destroy your body\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d bacteria that helps keep your immune system primed and ready to deal with serious you may come across of.\n\nRampant use of antibiotics will also lead to the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria that will gradually render this popular treatment ineffective.\n\nOne of the active compounds in garlic, diallyl sulphide, is able to break down the resilient membranes of bacteria easily.\n\nBest of all, it does not have any of the terrible side effects of caused by the commonly prescribed ciprofloxacin.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s one of my favorite superfoods.\n\nTurmeric is a powerful ally in treating bronchitis because it\u2019s such a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Thus reducing the very reason you have uncontrollable coughs and the their respective phlegm expulsion.\n\nGinger is the gift that keeps on giving, besides being the perfect spicy addition to any tea, it\u2019s a potent anti-inflammatory compound (vital in reducing the overall effects of the infection) and it helps get rid of the bacterial infection by boosting your immune system.\n\nHoney is a powerful antibiotic with none of the dangerous consequences brought about by overusing antibiotics.\n\nWith its polyphenols, hydrogen peroxide, and osmosis effect, honey is the perfect natural way to combat infections.\n\nOriginated by the high concentration of sugar in honey, the osmosis effect is when honey absorbs water from bacterial cells so they die of thirst.\n\nAdditionally, honey prevents the formation of bacterial communities that eventually harbor infections diseases.\n\nBy breaking these bacterial groups, honey is able to stop a group\u2019s ability to grow or become increasingly viable. This effect renders bacteria vulnerable to other antibiotic treatments.\n\nAnd the cherry on top: honey is a powerful antifungal and antibacterial agent. Meaning that it will target unknown fungal infections that might be causing bronchitis.\n\nDid you know that your digestive system houses approximately more than five hundred varieties of bacteria? They\u2019re all part of the micro ecosystem that helps digests your food and boost your immune system.\n\nProbiotics are a variation of bacteria that are particularly efficient at helping your digestion, improving your immune system, and breaking down the toxins that go through your digestive tract.\n\nIf your bronchitis survives this treatment for more than a week, please consult your family doctor.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "5 Healthy Remedies for Bronchitis", "description": "Are you going through a bout of bronchitis?
