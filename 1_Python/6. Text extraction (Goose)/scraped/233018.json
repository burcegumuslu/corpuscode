Further, they lack transparency, rely on poor sources, and have failed numerous fact checks.\n\nBias Rating: RIGHT CONSPIRACY-PSEUDOSCIENCE\n\n Factual Reporting: VERY LOW\n\n Country: USA\n\n Press Freedom Rank: MOSTLY FREE\n\n Media Type: Website/Documentary\n\n Traffic/Popularity: Medium Traffic\n\n MBFC Credibility Rating: LOW CREDIBILITY\n\nDiedSuddenly.info is the website for Stew Peters\u2019s Anti-Vaccine documentary \u201cDied Suddenly.\u201d The website lacks transparency as they do not offer a detailed about page, but they do list the filmmakers as Nicholas Stumphauzer and Matthew Skow.\n\nThe website states that the movie is \u201cBrought To You by the Stew Peters Network.\u201d\n\nStew Peters is a far-right online talk show host with a history of making false and unsubstantiated claims, such as claiming there is snake venom in the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nDiedSuddenly.info does not list ownership. Revenue is generated through donations to Stumphauzer and Skow.\n\nStew Peters, a far-right radio host with a history of advancing COVID-19 conspiracy theories, is the producer of \u201cDied Suddenly.\u201d In his previous movie, \u201cWatch the Water,\u201d the radio host claimed that the coronavirus is a synthetic snake venom spread through COVID-19 vaccines and drinking water. Politifact rated this claim as pants on fire.\n\nThe website does not present text-based news, only hosting the 78-minute video. In Died Suddenly, Peters continues promoting debunked conspiracy theories and pseudoscience related to Covid-19 and the vaccines. The film\u2019s general theme is that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines are part of a depopulation scheme by global elites who want to establish a global regime.\u201d Further, the video relies on unreliable sources such as Children\u2019s Health Defense, Dr. Robert Malone, and other alternative health advocates.\n\nIn general, DiedSuddenly.info advances debunked conspiracy theories and impossible pseudoscience (see failed fact checks). For a detailed account of all the disinformation contained in this film, please see here: The film \u201cDied Suddenly\u201d rehashes debunked claims and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 vaccines, and here \u2018Died Suddenly\u2019 Pushes Bogus Depopulation Theory.\n\u2022 None The video suggests that this is part of a shadowy plot to depopulate the world. \u2013 False\n\u2022 None Unusual clots have been found in dead people and may be due to COVID-19 vaccination. \u2013 False\n\u2022 None Healthy adults are dropping dead across the globe from problems related to COVID vaccines. \u2013 False\n\nOverall, we rate DiedSuddenly.info as an extreme right-biased Tin-Foil Hat Conspiracy website that also publishes Quackery-level Pseudoscience. Further, they lack transparency, rely on poor sources, and have failed numerous fact checks. (D.
