Posted in Latest news\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised the United Nations COP26 Climate Summit on Monday he would remake the American economy, abandoning carbon-based fossil fuels and focusing on renewable energy.\n\nThe president spoke to the summit after struggling to stay awake for the opening remarks from world leaders about the importance of addressing the issue of global warming.\n\nBiden said he was planing \u201ca marathon\u201d for the United States economy that would \u201ctransform the largest economy in the world into a thriving, innovative, equitable, and just clean energy engine of net zero for a net-zero world.\u201d\n\nThe president previously expressed his disappointment that the leaders of Russia and China did not attend the summit to join the world in reducing carbon emissions in their economies.\n\nBut during his speech, Biden outlined his goal to make the United States into a \u201cnet-zero emissions economy\u201d by 2050, promising \u201cbold action\u201d to lead the world on climate change:\n\nBiden alluded to former President Donald Trump walking away from climate commitments in the past and said his administration was \u201cworking overtime\u201d to demonstrate action on the climate crisis.\n\nBiden used his speech to outline his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d agenda as evidence he was serious about climate change, even though it remains stalled in Congress.\n\nHe argued his proposals would help the climate by offering more taxpayer subsidies for electric vehicles and by electrifying school buses.\n\nHe also promoted the idea of building more electric charging stations, windmills, and solar-powered infrastructure that would improve the production and use of green energy.\n\nHe said his agenda would help Americans to save energy by installing solar panels on their homes and making their homes more energy-efficient.\n\nBiden stressed the importance of the moment, calling for all nations to join the United States in transforming their economies away from fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cThis is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, the existential threat, threat to human existence as we know it, and every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases,\u201d he warned.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden Tells #COP26 He Will 'Remake' American Economy In Net-Zero's Image",
