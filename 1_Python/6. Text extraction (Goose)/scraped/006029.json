I'l be honest spending some time working in histopathology I did my consultants heads in with questions.as an injured party I doubt I'll be putting in a claim in my lifetime, I personally spent near 20k to cover my recovery, which ignores the year out of work living on savings relearning to walk, but i know how sh*t our gov is with this stuff and they'll do all it can to avoid paying a penny as much voters will demand as our society hate the disabled seeing them as you say as chancers.on one side i've not seen a gp as they've no ideawhat to do with injuries its not an ilness to manage) just as on the flip side you'd think az and the others would be interested in how the injured have recovered to gain insight into best recovery approaches (important if you think I'm sat the top end of the injured age range at just over 50) but not not a peep, no interestRecoveries like mine have gone from hyper acute back to somewhat normal should be hugely informative as to how brains repair themselves, equally as its an autoimmune response to the vax what's it effect on covid, even being on wards with covid patients I've never tested positive, is there an insight into a real vax in the blood of the injured.so again piss easy to weed out chancers it all revolves around the blood.which is easier to look st than its effect on society, As a parent with a pram I thought I knew what people where like, but that's nothing compared to the hatred the disabled get to see it certainly reshaped my view on society.. at this point our society has no redeeming factors and nothing worth fighting for..I keep thinking about doing a longer post here on the topic but where I stand I'll be run over by both sides, on the one side the numbers of vax injured are not small but on the other the treatments covid created all all focused on saving the elderly will mean extended life spans rather than mass die off, the thing society has to deal with at some point is the price it was willing to pay for extended life spans..", "opengraph": {"image": "https://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats7.jpg", "title": "Vaccine injury claims skyrocket in the UK , page 2", "description": "Vaccine injury claims skyrocket in the UK , page 2", "site_name": "AboveTopSecret.com"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
