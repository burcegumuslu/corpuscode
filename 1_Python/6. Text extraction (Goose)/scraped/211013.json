A 2021 study published in The Journal of Toxicological Sciences seems to suggest so.\n\nIn the aftermath of the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment disaster, many are looking for answers to the dioxin release problem. And activated charcoal is one such answer that in tests was found to enhance excretion of dioxins from the body.\n\nResearchers from Japan and Thailand looked at the effects of alginate-coated activated charcoal on mice exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD. Since standard activated charcoal can cause constipation, deficiency of fat-soluble nutrients, and hypocholesterolemia when ingested long-term, researchers used the alginate-coated variety, known as Health Carbon (HC), which was developed to minimize these side effects.\n\nUpon ingestion of the alginate-coated activate charcoal, the contaminated mice excreted much more TCDD than they did without the supplement, which was administered daily to the mice for 16 days following a single intraperitoneal administration of TCDD.\n\n\u201cBoth HC and unmodified AC at 3% or more significantly increased fecal excretion of TCDD in comparison with the control basal diet,\u201d the study explains. \u201cConsistent with this, TCDD radioactivity in the liver-a major TCDD storage organ-was markedly decreased by HC at concentrations of 3% and 10%.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to take activated charcoal, use the alginate-coated Health Carbon kind\n\nBe warned that unmodified activated charcoal consumed at 10 percent or more resulted in significant body weight reduction. When consumed at 20 percent or more, unmodified activated charcoal caused hypocholesterolemia in the mice.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, HC caused weight gain reduction only at a concentration of 20%, and there was no evidence of hypocholesterolemia at any dietary HC concentration,\u201d the study notes. \u201cHC not only retains the ability of AC to enhance fecal excretion of TCDD but also reduces some of the side effects of AC.\u201d\n\nAnother study published in the journal Environmental Research that same year further found that modified activated carbon enhances the adsorption of dioxins.\n\nIt turns out that activated carbon is commonly used to remove dioxins from flue gas via adsorption, helping to keep these poisons from escaping into the environment. Even when used commercially, activated carbon helps to bind dioxins to an intended target for flushing and removal from a system.\n\nModifying activated carbon with urea, the study further found, optimizes the pore structure of the activated carbon while incorporating nitrogen into it. This allows for improved adsorption and subsequent elimination.\n\n\u201cDr. Sircus\u2019 baking soda for dioxin detox seems to be way more efficient,\u201d wrote one commenter at Natural News about another method for dioxin removal that is perhaps even more effective than activated charcoal.\n\n\u201cThe military always cleans up their nuclear and other boo-boos with sodium bicarbonate. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to check on Dr. Simoncini as well. Sea salt and baking soda enema is simply unbeatable, with immediate relief, good for indefinite use.\u201d\n\nAnother person blasted Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine \u201cfor his stupidity in having those toxic chemicals burnt\u201d in the first place.\n\n\u201cOf course, on the other hand, he\u2019s as corrupt as Household and the others on trial now for bribery.\u201d\n\nAnother person wrote that all this dioxin release is an intentional part of implementing a New World Order government.\n\n\u201cConnect the dots and a picture starts to come to life,\u201d this person explained. \u201cCryptocurrencies, vaccines, wars, open borders, never-ending money printing, and Ol\u2019 Joe is showing us he\u2019s buying into the world government group. This is not going to end well.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about how to clean your body naturally, visit Cures.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Activated charcoal found to accelerate the body\u2019s elimination of deadly dioxins", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2023-02-28-activated-charcoal-accelerates-bodily-elimination-deadly-dioxins.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "Is it possible to cleanse the body of persistent dioxins using simple activated charcoal supplements?
