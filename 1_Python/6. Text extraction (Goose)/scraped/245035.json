In the United States, three options are available so far.\n\nPfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s vaccines (marketed as Comirnaty and Spikevax, respectively) have received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Johnson & Johnson\u2019s option has emergency use authorization, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends receiving the other two options in most cases. As of May 5, 2022, the FDA limited the use of Johnson & Johnson vaccines due to worrying side effects: After conducting an updated analysis, evaluation and investigation of reported cases, the FDA has determined that the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a syndrome of rare and potentially life-threatening blood clots in combination with low levels of blood platelets with onset of symptoms approximately one to two weeks following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, warrants limiting the authorized use of the vaccine.\n\nBut another COVID-19 vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford and marketed as Vaxzevria, is being used throughout much of the rest of the world, bolstering the global immunization effort. First approved in the United Kingdom in late 2020, it received World Health Organization (WHO) approval in February 2021. Over of the vaccine have now been distributed to more than 170 countries throughout the world so far, per the company.\n\nAlthough the vaccine hasn\u2019t been authorized for use in the United States yet, it could one day reach arms domestically. Here\u2019s what we know about it so far, and how it stacks up against Pfizer\u2019s, Moderna\u2019s, and vaccines.\n\nVaxzevria uses adenovirus-vectored technology, a harmless, modified version of a that usually spreads among chimpanzees. The primary series of Vaxzevria consists of spaced eight to 12 weeks apart.\n\nThis altered virus can\u2019t make you sick, but it carries a gene from the novel coronavirus\u2019 spike protein, the portion of the virus that triggers an . This allows the immune system to manufacture antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, teaching your body how to respond should you become infected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s used as a Trojan Horse,\u201d says , an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine. \u201cThe beauty of this is that the genetic material of the spike protein is coming into the body like it would if it were part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but you don\u2019t have any of the dangers of [catching] the virus.\u201d\n\nThe reason researchers chose a chimpanzee adenovirus is simple: The modified virus needs to be new to the people being vaccinated\u2014otherwise, your body won\u2019t create those all-important, unique antibodies. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine also relies on similar adenovirus-vectored tech, although only one shot is necessary (boosters aside).\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, meanwhile, rely on , which essentially introduces a piece of genetic code that tricks the body into producing COVID-19 antibodies, no virus required. Both of these vaccines require two shots spaced about a month apart.\n\nHow does AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine compare to Pfizer\u2019s, Moderna\u2019s, and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s?\n\nBefore variants took over, all four vaccines showed strong efficacy against serious COVID-19, preventing outcomes like hospitalization and death. Against mild illness, (Pfizer) and (Moderna) performed the best, followed by , then Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine. (The annual is usually between ; all four COVID-19 vaccines outperformed it.)\n\nThe , a mutated form of SARS-CoV-2 that appears to be less susceptible to the vaccines, is now causing most cases of COVID-19 throughout the world. A third dose of Vaxzevria administered as a booster offers \u201cincreased antibody response to the Omicron variant\u201d in an ongoing trial, per a January AstraZeneca .\n\nof the mRNA vaccines also seem to increase immune response against Omicron, at least in laboratory studies: Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty effectively \u201c \u201d the variant, while Moderna\u2019s Spikevax virus-fighting antibodies by 37 times. The CDC receiving a booster dose two months after getting Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine or five months after receiving your second dose of Comirnaty or Spikevax.\n\nAll four vaccines\u2019 are similar, including potential injection site pain and flu-like symptoms, including fever, fatigue, headaches, and muscle soreness, which are to be expected as your immune system is primed, especially after a second dose. \u201cVaccines stimulate the immune system, and you do have some side effects from that,\u201d Dr. Durbin explains. Symptoms generally last one to two days.\n\nDoes the AstraZeneca vaccine cause blood clots?\n\nVaxzevria is associated with a very rare condition called , or the formation of clots in blood vessels, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Last March, 13 European nations and Thailand temporarily their rollouts of the AstraZeneca vaccine over concerns over the blood clots, but soon resumed.\n\n\n\nBoth the EMA and the WHO insist that the vaccine is safe. Up to 1 in 10,000 people could be affected by thrombosis following Vaxzevria, the EMA warns, and the risk is greater in people younger than 50. In December, researchers the likely cause of these clots: If the vaccine reaches the bloodstream, some people\u2019s bodies release antibodies, which clump together with blood cells and cause clotting.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, the only adenovirus-vectored option offered domestically, was temporarily paused in the United States last April following rare reports of a new condition called . Part of the reason for the pause, Dr. Durbin explains, is making sure that healthcare providers are prepared to treat these blood clots and to inform people of the risks\u2014however slight\u2014of complications.\n\n\u201cThe thought is [incidents of thrombosis] have something to do with the adenovirus vector that\u2019s being used to deliver that spike protein genetic material,\u201d Dr. Durbin says. These cases are so rare that most experts believe that there is a \u201chost component, something about the people who got the clotting disorder that\u2019s different from people who didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThese issues were missed in clinical trials, Dr. Durbin says, because they\u2019re so exceedingly rare. No increased likelihood of blood clotting was found among participants in AstraZeneca\u2019s United States trial.\n\nWhich COVID-19 vaccine is the best?\n\n\u201cThe best vaccine is the one that\u2019s offered the day you go in for your appointment,\u201d says , chief clinical officer at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. \u201cAll of the [available] vaccines are incredibly effective. They\u2019re all safe.\u201d Each vaccine that has received FDA approval and authorization has been proven to decrease severe illness, hospitalization, and death, the worst outcomes of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIf all you got from COVID-19 was a head cold, we wouldn\u2019t be concerned,\u201d Dr. Durbin explains. \u201cThat\u2019s what these vaccines are doing: They\u2019re preventing that severe disease that is paralyzing healthcare systems around the world.\u201d\n\nCombined with masks, hand-washing, and social distancing, vaccines have been proven to be incredibly effective at keeping people safe from COVID-19. No matter which COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to you first, you can feel confident in its ability to protect you, as long as you continue being cautious until positive cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are significantly reduced nationwide.\n\n\u201cIf you can get a vaccine, get vaccinated,\u201d Dr. Durbin says. \u201c[Take] whatever vaccine that you can get to help us get out of this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
