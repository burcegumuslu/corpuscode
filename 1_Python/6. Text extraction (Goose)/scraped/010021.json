Its about possible biases, possible agendas, possible lack of reporting of information, and more importantly, what isn\u2019t being said and reported by the science communities, etc.\n\nYes, this podcast may seem one sided at times, and yes, they cherry pick occasional information to validate their perspective, but that, IMHO, is happening on all sides.\n\nI am not \u201cfor\u201d, or \u201cagainst\u201d vaccines. I did my part and took the two recommended vaccines and played along with the collective perception that vaccines are the answer to stop the spread???? (as originally sold to us in the media), and to reduce the stress on the Health Care system, which should really be called the \u201cDiseased Care System\u201d!\n\nHaving said that, there are always three or more perspectives in every experience; left side, right side, and several in between, above and below sides! Anyone who chooses to stand or defend one side, is most likely stuck with a lot of unhealth Ego attachments! A healthy mind is open and receptive to all POV. All POVs have a seed of Truth! The more expanded and conscious your mind becomes, the large the seeds of truth become visible and share their hidden truth!\n\nThis brings me to the response given by Carl-Richard above, a moderator no less, that has me questioning the health and open-mindedness of these forums.\n\nAfter watch the podcast from beginning to end, I continue to question the reality we have painted ourselves in, now more than ever before. I also get the \u201cfeeling\u201d that Actualizer.org is no-longer a forum that is totally committed to seeking truths that are controversial, or has the ability to have discussions on open perspectives that are not tainted in \u201cCONFIRMATION BIASIS\u201d?\n\nI also get the \u201cfeeling\u201d that a few/many people on this forum are blinded by fear and delusional reasoning, and that they no longer are capable of having open intelligent discussion about a pandemic that has, and is, causing suffering on both sides of this ridicules political landscape. Not only are people supposed to wear masks, but they are also supposed to wear blinders and ear-defenders. That\u2019s not the path to heighten enlightenment, consciousness or awareness IMO!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am all for wearing masks to protect people from the Virus, but not to silence or to stop listening, with an open mind, other POVs!\n\nThe Media has diseased our society and culture with fear, hate and anger so much that it has reduced our ability to have rational unbiased conversations. We instead have created a duality between good and bad, Pro-vax and Antivax mud slinging that is absolutely childish, and at best, delusional unconscious mind traps of stupidity.\n\nAgain, I am not for, or against the vaccine! I am a \u201cSeeker of Truth\u201d, I try to remain open minded as much as possible, and I try to consciously observe and stay aware of my belief system and patterns that may hinder or cling to self-inflicted stigmas, dogmas, and biases that prevent \u201cME\u201d from opening to the greater possible \u201cTruth\u201d.\n\nJust share a few thoughts, ideas and beliefs!", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Aubrey Marcus @ Covid Vaccines", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/74927-aubrey-marcus-covid-vaccines/", "description": "\n\n\tJust found this podcast the other day.
