Now there is reversal of these trends. From the start of the pandemic there have been reports with mixed results for mortality among pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and after COVID-19 vaccination. Sadly, many women have had both exposures in 2021 and beyond.\n\nThe CDC reports that ~65% of women have taken a vaccine\u2014most before conception and the remainder through the term of gestation. This occurred because the CDC advised that pregnant women take this risk with no assurances on the health of the mother or baby through pregnancy.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination among pregnant people aged 18-49 years overall, by race and ethnicity, and date reported to CDC \u2013 Vaccine Safety Datalink,* United States, Accessed April 10, 2023\n\nNow the CDC is reporting record maternal death rates in 2021 compared to prior decades and in the report by Hoyert et al, has shown a stepwise increase for death during or shortly after pregnancy. All groups are up but the worst is for African American women.\n\nWhile lockdowns, reduced access to prenatal care, and a variety of factors could be related to maternal outcomes, the CDC report is willfully blind to major exposures 1) acute COVID-19 which could have played a role in 2020 and 2) COVID-19 vaccination which was prevalent in 65% of mothers in 2021. The CDC must open up all data on COVID-19 cases and vaccination to researchers for urgent epidemiologic evaluation of these disturbing trends. Death among pregnant women should be a top priority for public health researchers.\n\nWomen of childbearing age and pregnant women should refrain from COVID-19 vaccination given its pregnancy category X status and the absence of any assurances on short or long-term safety.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.
