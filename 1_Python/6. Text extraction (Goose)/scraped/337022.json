Take a look at these FACTS \u2013\n\u2022 A cellphone is a two-way microwave radio with intermittent and destabilizing pulses.\n\u2022 The weak and erratic microwave radiation from cellphones and tablets cannot directly break the bonds that hold molecules together, but does disrupt DNA, weakens the brain\u2019s protective barrier, and releases highly reactive and damaging free radicals.\n\u2022 A five-year-old\u2019s brain is encased in a thinner skull and contains more fluid than an adult brain. The bone marrow of a child\u2019s head absorbs 10 times more radiation than an adult, while those of infants and toddlers will absorb even more.\n\u2022 Every major well-designed study ever conducted has found that those who use cellphones regularly for half an hour a day or more for a decade have a doubled risk of brain cancer, and those who began using cellphones as teenagers have four to five times more disease in less than 10 years.\n\u2022 Exposure to radiation from cellphones may also play a role for a growing spate of serious problems, including attention and hearing deficits, autism, behavioral changes, insomnia, ringing of the ears or tinnitus, Parkinsons, Alzheimer\u2019s, and a broad array of disturbances to the nervous system.\n\nDo you want your children to lead an unhealthy life or do you want to protect them from radiation emitted from high tech gadgets? Watch Dr. Martin Blank, from the Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics at Colombia University, outlining the various dangers associated with these devices and take corrective measures\u2026 Right NOW.\n\nGet Your Anonymous T-Shirt / Sweatshirt / Hoodie / Tanktop, Smartphone or Tablet Cover or Mug In Our Spreadshirt Shop!
