Fed Head Jay Powell keeps telling us \u201cinflation is transitory,\u201d meaning it will be short lived. The investment community is not so sure about that. As a matter of fact, many are worried and downright skeptical that inflation will be transitory but entrenched and sticking around for a long time. And why wouldn\u2019t they be?

Dane Wigington, founder of GeoEngineeringWatch.org, says look first at geoengineering as the cause for much of the \u201cMega-drought\u201d problem, but you won\u2019t ever hear that from the MSM.\n\nThe new ground and air offensive against Hamas by the Israeli Army and Air Force will also be covered.\n\nJoin Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog.com as he talks about these stories and more in the Weekly News Wrap-Up for 5.14.21.\n\nFinancial writer and analyst Craig Hemke of TFMetalsReport.com will be the guest for the Saturday Night Post. Hemke says inflation is here, and it\u2019s not just passing through. Its effects on the gold and silver prices will be big this year\u2014especially silver. There are more reasons than just inflation for that as Hemke will explain.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://usawatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1a.jpg", "https://usawatchdog.com/", "https://usawatchdog.com/donations/", "https://www.tfmetalsreport.com/", "https://usawatchdog.com/discount-gold-and-silver-trading/", "https://satellitephonestore.com/special-promo?affiliate=usawatchdog?utm_source=USA%20Watch%20Dog%20-%20Greg%20Hunter&utm_medium=Podcast&utm_campaign=USA%20Watch%20Dog%20-%20Greg%20Hunter", "https://dry-element.myshopify.com", "https://readymaderesources.com", "https://www.westonscientificllc.com", "https://usawatchdog.com/join/", "https://usawatchdog.com/advertise/", "https://usawatchdog.com/trump-raid-coverup-cheney-blowout-inflation-increasing/", "https://usawatchdog.com/trump-indicted-died-suddenly-increasing-de-dollarization-inflation/", "https://usawatchdog.com/war-coming-more-die-unexpectedly-record-inflation-drought-disaster/", "https://usawatchdog.com/russia-ukraine-intensifies-germany-tanking-food-inflation-and-drought/", "https://usawatchdog.com/fda-criminally-approved-bioweapon-as-safe-effective-vaccine-karen-kingston/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "05/14/2021\u00a0\u00a0\u2022"}
