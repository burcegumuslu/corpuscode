According to a new report by the New York Times, the CDC has also been collecting much more detailed data about Covid infections that breaks down by age, race, and vaccination status. The critical information would go a long way towards figuring out an end to the pandemic, but the agency has purposefully suppressed the information from the public over fears that it would be \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d and cause \u201cvaccine hesitancy.\u201d In other words, the \u2018experts\u2019 in the US public health regime believe the plebs aren\u2019t capable enough to interpret something themselves. The CDC\u2019s response when questioned about their withholding of Covid data and lack of transparency is essentially \u201cwe don\u2019t trust you to be able to understand the truth.\u201d The condescension is palpable. The wheels are finally coming off. https://t.co/74ScUienhs Within the data that has been withheld by the CDC are detailed information about breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, which the agency has been collecting since the beginning of the vaccine rollout, according to officials who spoke to the NYT. So much for the bogus lie that has been pushed by public health officials for months, claiming that breakthrough infections weren\u2019t being tracked at all. The medical elites just decided to hide the data because it didn\u2019t fit the approved narrative, and, naturally, blamed the potential for \u2018misinformation\u2019 as justification for the coverup. From the New York Times: \u201cKristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C., said the agency has been slow to release the different streams of data \u201cbecause basically, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not yet ready for prime time.\u201d She said the agency\u2019s \u201cpriority when gathering any data is to ensure that it\u2019s accurate and actionable.\u201d Another reason is fear that the information might be misinterpreted, Ms. Nordlund said.\u201d The performance of vaccines and boosters, particularly in younger adults, is among the most glaring omissions in data the C.D.C. has made public. Last year, the agency repeatedly came under fire for not tracking so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated Americans, and focusing only on individuals who became ill enough to be hospitalized or die. The agency presented that information as risk comparisons with unvaccinated adults, rather than provide timely snapshots of hospitalized patients stratified by age, sex, race and vaccination status. But the C.D.C. has been routinely collecting information since the Covid vaccines were first rolled out last year, according to a federal official familiar with the effort. The agency has been reluctant to make those figures public, the official said, because they might be misinterpreted as the vaccines being ineffective. Ms. Nordlund confirmed that as one of the reasons. Another reason, she said, is that the data represents only 10 percent of the population of the United States. But the C.D.C. has relied on the same level of sampling to track influenza for years.\u201d Why would data about breakthrough infections fuel \u2018vaccine hesitancy?\u2019 Could it be because the numbers really look that bad? What else are the \u2018experts\u2019 hiding?\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
