This latest \u2018zoonotic\u2019 sensation appears be the obscure and exotic monkeypox virus, which has already grabbed the headlines, as members of the embryonic global government confab, the G7, are already throwing hundreds of millions in public money at Big Pharma supposedly to \u2018stop the spread.\u2019 D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, anyone?\n\nOver in the UK, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that the government will be stocking up on smallpox vaccines to help guard against the impending scourge of monkeypox. This, despite the fact that to date, there\u2019s still no substantial science which proves or even remotely indicates that such a one-size-fits-all vaccine will do anything to stop the spread of the alleged virus.\n\nJavid claims that another 11 supposed \u2018cases\u2019 of monkeypox have now been \u2018confirmed\u2019 in the UK. However, no real evidence has been presented which definitively shows that any of these people are infected and sick due to a specific monkeypox virus derived from a patient sample which has been isolated and purified revealing a full virus present in nature. To date, the government has not shown they are in possession of such evidence.\n\nSo on which basis are these monkeypox diagnoses being made? By symptoms, and a PCR test? If so, how long ago was this PCR testing protocol developed, and was it ever peer reviewed? This is all beside the fact that the PCR test is not a legitimate diagnostic test.\n\nOf course, there is no way anyone could possibly make such a general claim as to the alleged \u2018deadliness\u2019 of this, or any other spontaneous exotic pathogen being touted by \u2018public health\u2019 officials or mainstream media outlets. Here we are witnessing the exact same fraud perpetrated by \u2018public health\u2019 officials and so-called experts when the Covid pandemic campaign was launched in winter of 2020 when their emergency response and policy prescriptions were driven by fear and hype, and based on guesswork and creative data modeling. We should know by now that such a wild, reactionary approach is a recipe for disaster, and yet, government and media seem ready to repeat their past failures again.\n\nAnd just like that, with a flip of the \u2018global pandemic\u2019 switch, large tranches of public money are once again flowing freely into the pockets of the transnational pharmaceutical cartel, along with the various bio surveillance testing, technologies, PPE, and digital app rackets\u2026\n\nThe U.S. government has ordered millions of doses of a vaccine that protects against monkeypox. The news follows the first confirmed case in the states\u2014a man in Massachusetts\u2014following an outbreak in the U.K.\n\nThe order amounts to a $119 million order for Jynneos vaccines, which are used for the prevention of both smallpox and monkeypox. It was announced by biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic, which makes the vaccine, on Wednesday.\n\nThe order will convert bulk vaccines, which have already been made and invoiced under previous contracts with the U.S. government, into freeze-dried versions which have an improved shelf-life.\n\nThe total government contract with Bavarian Nordic amounts to $299 million [share prices have surged following the announcement of a new prospective pandemic], which would provide 13 million freeze-dried doses.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that the first doses will be manufactured by next year with further doses made in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe order comes amid concern about monkeypox cases that have been reported in the U.K. with one case also being reported in Massachusetts.\n\nMonkeypox is a viral disease first discovered in 1958 among colonies of monkeys that were being kept for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970.\n\nSymptoms in humans may include fever, headache, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion. Within a day or a few days of the fever, patients then develop a rash that spreads across the body.\n\nThe illness tends to last for two to four weeks and has been shown to cause death in as many as 10 percent of people who catch it.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed a single case of monkeypox in an adult male who had recently traveled to Canada. The health department said the case \u201cposes no risk to the public\u201d and that the individual is hospitalized in good condition.\n\nIt is the first case of monkeypox to be detected in the country this year. In 2021, two U.S. cases were reported\u2026\n\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "opengraph": {"image:width": "610", "image:height": "405", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden Orders Millions of Monkeypox Vaccines After One Alleged 'Infection' - 21st Century Wire", "description": "21WIRE | And just like that - with a flip of the 'global pandemic' switch, the public money is once again flowing directly to Big Pharma.", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/05/20/biden-orders-millions-of-monkeypox-vaccines-after-one-man-allegedly-infected/", "site_name": "21st Century Wire", "article:publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/21st-Century-Wire/182032255155419", "article:published_time": "2022-05-20T15:46:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-20T17:24:48+00:00", "image": "https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Monkeypox-2.jpg", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Africa", "Pfizer", "Big Pharma", "Vaccines", "Smallpox", "COVID 19", "G7", "Bavarian Nordic", "fauci", "Joe Biden", "monkeypox"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61520228", "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/05/20/who-stealth-coup-to-dictate-global-health-agenda-of-gates-big-pharma/", "https://www.newsweek.com/monkeypox-cased-uk-massachusetts-case-vaccine-ordered-us-1708075", "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-cases-confirmed-in-england-latest-updates", "https://www.newsweek.com/what-monkeypox-could-it-threat-u-s-1706996", "https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html", "https://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-public-health-officials-confirm-case-of-monkeypox", "https://www.newsweek.com/monkeypox-cased-uk-massachusetts-case-vaccine-ordered-us-1708075", "http://www.21stcenturywire.com/tag/COVID-19", "https://21w.co/support", "https://21w.co/shop-clive", "https://21w.co/shop-clive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2F21stcenturywire.com%2F2022%2F05%2F20%2Fbiden-orders-millions-of-monkeypox-vaccines-after-one-man-allegedly-infected%2F", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Biden%20Orders%20Millions%20of%20Monkeypox%20Vaccines%20After%20One%20Alleged%20%E2%80%98Infection%E2%80%99&url=https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/05/20/biden-orders-millions-of-monkeypox-vaccines-after-one-man-allegedly-infected/&via=21stCenturyWire"], "authors": ["NEWS WIRE"], "publish_date": "2022-05-20T15:46:00+00:00"}
