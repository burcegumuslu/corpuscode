Even the group that supports former President Donald Trump was not spared.\n\nCrawford expounded on the People\u2019s Convoy movement, modeled after the Canadian Freedom Convoy, that challenged Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandates for truckers. According to him, the group had been run by a non-trucker who never showed its balance sheet \u2013 leading to suspicions of embezzlement. (Related: Wheels of freedom: American truckers set to launch People\u2019s Convoy against Biden\u2019s tyrannical COVID mandates.)\n\nHe further cited one example of a chaos agent, a woman who went by the pseudonym Carolina Bonita, who had joined the convoy volunteering to help. The financial expert recounted: \u201cEveryone I talked to said she was constantly screwing things up \u2013 from which towns they were going to stop into where they were going to sleep at night. So they eventually kicked her out.\u201d\n\nAccording to an \u201canonymous\u201d report, Bonita had an uncanny way of tracking down every last trucker or activist. She also had a habit of bragging about her accomplishments and connections, even touting her supposed access to millions of dollars and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. People\u2019s Convoy organizer Brian Brase said of her: \u201cAll the miscommunications, breakdowns, problems and disasters \u2026 always led back to Carolina.\u201d\n\nAnother chaos agent in the People\u2019s Convoy mentioned by Crawford was attorney Leigh Dundas, who joined \u201cLawfare\u201d host Tom Renz during a COVID-19 vaccine roundtable organized by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). Dundas was also present during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol. Crawford recounted that she was kicked out in some events for fomenting violence.\n\n\u201cShe was at the Capitol giving fiery speeches,\u201d Crawford said, recalling that her remarks were the \u201cmost violent of all the speeches that I heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be within our rights to grab the lawmakers, drag them out back, hang and shoot them,\u201d Dundas allegedly said.\n\nThe anonymous report also mentioned that Bonita\u2019s Operation Take Back America and Dundas\u2019 Freedom Fighter Nation were closely collaborating with each other as evidenced on social media. The two have since parted ways, however.\n\nThe financial expert also mentioned that Bonita was tailing the convoy in a vehicle that wound up getting pulled over. \u201cThere was a pile of guns in the car,\u201d he told the Natural News and Brighteon.com founder. According to Crawford, authorities seized the guns out of Bonita\u2019s vehicle \u2013 but \u201cthere was no evidence that the event ever took place.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the Health Ranger commented that freedom movements are being \u201cframed up\u201d for violent crimes during their rallies and events. The best way to avoid such a situation, he advised, is by leaving weapons at home.\n\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019ve always said: If you protest 100 percent peacefully exercise freedom of speech, leave your weapons at home,\u201d Adams stressed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring your guns, don\u2019t bring your knives because you don\u2019t want to be trapped in a scenario where provocateurs rush and shoot up some innocent people. You will get charged for being part of a mob and having a weapon.\u201d\n\nCrawford agreed with the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d host, adding that people attending such events should probably know other participants well.\n\nVisit Traitors.news for more stories about chaos agents.\n\nListen to the full episode of \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d with Mike Adams and Mathew Crawford below.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\n\u201cAnti-vaxxer\u201d hunter who terrorized Freedom Convoy truckers COLLAPSES on camera: Was it the covid jab?\n\nOntario government shuts down 39 trucking companies for participating in Freedom Convoy.\n\nCanadian authorities find they are unable to seize Bitcoin donations made to Freedom Convoy protesters.", "opengraph": {"title": "Health Ranger Report: Mathew Crawford warns about CHAOS AGENTS who infiltrated the freedom movement", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2023-03-22-mathew-crawford-chaos-agents-infiltrated-freedom-movements.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "Finance specialist Mathew Crawford disclosed during his appearance on the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d that so-called \u201cchaos agents\u201d infiltrated the freedom movement\u00a0in America and tarnished the real advocacy of these groups. \u201cWithin any important movement, there\u2019s a long history of agents infiltrating it,\u201d Crawford told Health Ranger Mike Adams. \u201cIt\u2019s done so that somebody can have [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.freedom.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2023/03/Police-Riot-Protest-Woman-Yelling.jpg"}, "tags": ["civil unrest", "conspiracy", "big government", "Carolina Bonita", "false-flag", "freedom movements", "Health Ranger Report", "Liberty", "chaos agents", "Mike Adams", "provocateurs", "deception", "Mathew Crawford", "Health Ranger", "Leigh Dundas", "freedom", "People's Convoy", "infiltrators"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.brighteon.com/f7bf5e63-5bfc-4eb4-8a48-bde462a15048", "http://healthfreedom.news", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-02-20-american-truckers-to-start-peoples-convoy-against-mandates.html", "https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/dc56e0ef-12f2-48c3-a87d-467422ae77db/The%20Bonita%20Report.pdf", "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/leigh-dundas-truckers-january-6", "https://brighteon.com", "http://falseflag.news", "http://Traitors.news", "https://www.brighteon.com/f7bf5e63-5bfc-4eb4-8a48-bde462a15048", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/hrreport", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-06-07-totalitarian-takeovers-have-similar-telltale-signs.html", "https://vaccines.news/2022-11-11-antivaxxer-hunter-freedom-convoy-collapse-covid-jab.html", "https://uprising.news/2022-03-04-freedom-convoy-protests-struggle-freedom-great-reset.html", "https://tyranny.news/2022-03-02-ontario-closes-trucking-companies-over-freedom-convoy.html", "https://cryptocult.news/2022-03-25-canada-authorities-seize-bitcoin-donations-freedom-convoy.html", "https://www.brighteon.com/f7bf5e63-5bfc-4eb4-8a48-bde462a15048", "https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/dc56e0ef-12f2-48c3-a87d-467422ae77db/The%20Bonita%20Report.pdf", "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/leigh-dundas-truckers-january-6", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ffreedomnews%2F2023-03-22-mathew-crawford-chaos-agents-infiltrated-freedom-movements&linkname=Health%20Ranger%20Report%3A%20Mathew%20Crawford%20warns%20about%20CHAOS%20AGENTS%20who%20infiltrated%20the%20freedom%20movement", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
