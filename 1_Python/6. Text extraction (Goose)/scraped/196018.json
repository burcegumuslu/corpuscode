That is why independent scientists used young adolescent rats in their GM feeding studies. The rats showed significant health damage after only 10 days, including damaged immune systems and digestive function, smaller brains, livers, and testicles, partial atrophy of the liver, and potentially pre-cancerous cell growth in the intestines.\n\nChildren are more susceptible to allergies\n\nChildren are three to four times more prone to allergies than adults. Infants below two years old are at greatest risk-they have the highest incidence of reactions, especially to new allergens encountered in the diet. Even tiny amounts of allergens can sometimes cause reactions in children. Breast fed infants can be exposed via the mother\u2019s diet, and fetuses may possibly be exposed in the womb. Michael Meacher, the former minister of the environment for the UK, said, \u201cAny baby food containing GM products could lead to a dramatic rise in allergies.\u201d GM corn is particularly problematic for children, as they generally eat a higher percentage of corn in their diet. Further, allergic children often rely on corn protein. Mothers using cornstarch as a talc substitute on their children\u2019s skin might also inadvertently expose them via inhalation.\n\nChildren are more susceptible to problems with milk\n\nMilk and dairy products from cows treated with the genetically engineered bovine growth hormone (rbGH) contain an increased amount of the hormone IGF-1, which is one of the highest risk factors associated with breast and prostate cancer. The Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association called for more studies to determine if ingesting \u201chigher than normal concentrations of [IGF-1] is safe for children, adolescents, and adults.\u201d Sam Epstein, M.D., Chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition and author of eight books, wrote, \u201crbGH and its digested products could be absorbed from milk into blood, particularly in infants, and produce hormonal and allergic effects.\u201d He described how \u201ccell-stimulating growth factors . . . could induce premature growth and breast stimulation in infants, and possibly promote breast cancer in adults.\u201d Dr. Epstein pointed out that the hormones in cows could promote the production of \u201csteroids and adrenaline-type stressor chemicals . . . likely to contaminate milk and may be harmful, particularly to infants and young children.\u201d\n\nChildren are more susceptible to nutritional problems\n\nA 2002 report by the UK\u2019s Royal Society, said that genetic modification \u201ccould lead to unpredicted harmful changes in the nutritional state of foods.\u201d They therefore recommended that potential health effects of GM foods be rigorously researched before being fed to pregnant or breast-feeding women, elderly people, those suffering from chronic disease, and babies. Likewise, according to former minister Meacher, unexpected changes in estrogen levels in GM soy used in infant formula \u201cmight affect sexual development in children,\u201d and that \u201ceven small nutritional changes could cause bowel obstruction.\u201d\n\nRead more about GMO Foods Pose Higher Risks for Children", "opengraph": {"title": "GMO Foods Pose Higher Risks for Children", "site_name": "MEDIA ROOTS \u2013 Reporting From Outside Party Lines", "image": "http://www.mediaroots.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ad2new.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "http://mediaroots.org/gmo-foods-pose-higher-risks-for-children/"}, "tags": ["Pesticides", "Soy", "Genetically Modified Organisms", "Vegetables"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://responsibletechnology.org/gmo-dangers/higher-risks-for-children", "http://responsibletechnology.org/gmo-dangers/higher-risks-for-children", "http://responsibletechnology.org/gmo-dangers/higher-risks-for-children"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "May 10, 2011"}
