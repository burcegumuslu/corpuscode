Instead, the figure slightly increased to 9,934.\n\nAnd, in 2022, with an approximately 85% vaccinated population in January and a less deadly Covid variant dominant, Covid deaths increased again.\n\nOver 2022, Health Canada data shows 15,844 deaths occurred due to Covid \u2013 almost double the number of deaths in 2020 when citizens were \u201cunprotected.\u201d\n\nOver half of these reported deaths between 2020 and 2022 were among Canadians aged 80 years and older.\n\nHealth Canada no longer provides data on death by vaccination status. As such, there\u2019s no way to decipher which deaths in 2022 were among vaccinated populations and which were among unvaccinated.\n\nThe health agency does show overall death percentages by vaccine status from the start of the vaccine rollout in December 2020. This data reveals that just over half of all Covid deaths took place among those who received at least one Covid vaccine.\n\nLegacy media created hysteria around the Delta variant in 2021, as the just-vaccinated population was learning they were not immune from getting infected with \u2013 or dying from \u2013 Covid.\n\nData suggested that the Delta variant was more contagious than the previously dominant Alpha, but less deadly. Furthermore, research indicates the Omicron variant \u2013 which became dominant in 2022 \u2013 is even less lethal than the Delta.\n\nAs previously reported by The Counter Signal, Canada\u2019s 2022 excess deaths trajectory is on pace to shatter the total from 2021 \u2013 and obliterate that from 2020.\n\nExcess deaths is the term that indicates whether a region had more or fewer deaths than expected, given demographics and historical trends. The figure helps calculate the true impact of a health crisis.\n\nHealth Canada data indicates 13,940 excess deaths took place in 2022 up to August 27.\n\nBy this same period in 2021, the total excess deaths was 10,406. In 2020, the total was 8,057.\n\nIn other words, as the percentage of Canadians \u201cvaccinated\u201d against Covid increased, so too did the excess death total and the Covid deaths.\n\u2022 Ghana Becomes first Country in Africa that Approves Oxford's new Malaria Vaccine\n\u2022 Toronto pushing to decriminalize all drugs for any age, including fentanyl and crack\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDid you like this information?
