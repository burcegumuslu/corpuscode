This special pumping cycle sends blood back to the heart at the time when it normally receives blood. The resulting ECP increases the blood supply and reduces the amount of work the heart must do to circulate blood throughout the body.\n\nAccording to Tenpenny, the treatment has been around since 1953. In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration approved its use for angina (chest pain caused by diminished blood flow to the heart), cardiogenic shock (a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough oxygenated blood to the organs) and high blood pressure. Seven years later in 2002, the regulator gave a soft nod of approval for ECP to be used for cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart experiences difficulty pumping the blood throughout the body.\n\n\u201cIt improves blood flow by 20 to 40 percent. If you\u2019ve already had a stent, it makes your blood flow better. It\u2019s so safe, it can even be used during a heart attack,\u201d Tenpenny said.\n\n\u201c[ECP] can improve your ejection fraction \u2013 that squeezing amount and getting the amount of blood out of your system. It lowers blood pressure [and] increases blood flow to extremities and into your brain.\u201d\n\nTenpenny also mentioned that ECP helps the blood vessels by increasing nitric oxide, a substance in the body that makes vessels dilate. This allows more oxygenated blood to reach the blood vessels in different organs. Moreover, ECP also decreases inflammation and stimulates the production of a hormone that aids in building and growing blood vessels.\n\nAccording to Tenpenny, ECP can minimize the need for drugs and increase a person\u2019s ability to be active without experiencing cardiac symptoms. Based on research done over the last 25 to 35 years in China, Japan, Singapore and India, ECP helps treat various cardiovascular ailments. Moreover, it also helps in improving the health of patients who have suffered strokes, dizziness, Parkinson\u2019s disease, memory loss, autoimmune disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and erectile dysfunction.\n\nOne study cited by the Brighteon.TV host showed 70 percent of patients saw improvements in their health condition after undergoing ECP therapy within three months after having a stroke. Another study she cited involved a patient who suffered from long-haul Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. The said patient had her symptoms completely resolved after undergoing ECP therapy thrice a week for five weeks. (Related: A simple amino acid treatment protocol helps covid-19 patients recover faster.)\n\nThe osteopathic doctor also outlined perfect candidates for ECP therapy. Those with refractory chest pain, those taking nitroglycerin all the time and those suffering from blood vessel blockages ought to try the therapy, she said. Individuals with coronary artery disease that cannot be treated with surgeries and stents, alongside those with high coronary calcium scores who need collateral circulation can also try it.\n\nTenpenny also outlined those who should not undergo ECP therapy. These include pregnant women, those with open wounds on the legs and those taking the blood thinner warfarin. Patients suffering from fever, abdominal aneurysm, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, superficial blood clots and superficial phlebitis are likewise discouraged from ECP therapy.\n\nFollow Heart.news for more news about treatments for cardiovascular issues.\n\nWatch the March 6 episode of \u201cThe Tenpenny Report TV\u201d below. \u201cThe Tenpenny Report TV\u201d airs every Monday at 7-8 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nThe vaccine agenda: Dr. Sherri Tenpenny exposes the lies spread by government about COVID and vaccines.\n\nStudy finally confirms \u201cinflammatory theory\u201d of heart disease: Findings can be used to develop new treatments that minimize stroke risk.\n\nResearchers are developing light therapy as a non-invasive, alternative treatment for disease.\n\nCardiologist: Over 7M Americans may have some form of HEART INJURY due to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSurgery a risk for heart damage: Increased risk of death from heart cell damage found to occur during or after non-heart surgery.", "opengraph": {"title": "Dr. Sherri Tenpenny discusses the benefits of external counterpulsation therapy \u2013 Brighteon.TV", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2023-03-15-dr-tenpenny-discusses-benefits-of-ecp-therapy.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "Osteopathic medicine practitioner Dr. Sherri Tenpenny elaborated on the benefits of external counterpulsation (ECP) therapy on the March 6 edition of \u201cThe Tenpenny Report TV\u201d on Brighteon.TV.
