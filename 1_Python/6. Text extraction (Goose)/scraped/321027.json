Should they not be part of the policy debate and discussion? Since when is it okay to impose uncertain healthy policies on supposedly free people the same way a dictatorial leader would? (Related: After abandoning objective science and endorsing left-wing political agendas, how is the Lancet still considered a medical journal?)\n\nNot if the objective, the real objective, is control over the population; when control is the overriding goal, then discussion is an impediment.\n\nAnd along those lines, \u2018opponents\u2019 to government policy \u2014 in this case, when governments have decided that \u2018vaccines are good\u2019 and \u2018dissent to vaccines is bad,\u2019 the powers that be then must not simply disagree with their opponents, they have to demonize, dehumanize and de-legitimize them, even if it means putting their lives in danger with false accusations of \u201cextremism.\u201d\n\nIn July 2020, Imran Ahmed, a member of the Steering Committee on Countering Extremism Pilot Task Force under the British government\u2019s Commission for Countering Extremism and the chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), told The Independent he considers anti-vaxxers \u201can extremist group that pose a national security risk,\u201d because \u201conce someone has been exposed to one type of conspiracy it\u2019s easy to lead them down a path where they embrace more radical world views that can lead to violent extremism.\u201d\n\nWho thinks like this? Authoritarians do. Dictators. Tyrants. There is absolutely nothing to link concern over vaccines to violent extremism. Nothing.\n\nBut the same kind of tyranny is brewing in the \u2018land of the free\u2019 \u2014 across the pond in America.\n\nBefore President Trump even boarded Air Force One out of D.C., Democrats and their sick, twisted media lapdogs began fantasizing about \u201cdeprogramming\u201d his 74 million-plus supporters by sending them all to \u2018reeducation camps\u2019 so they can indoctrinate them back into the Biden/Democrat/Deep State fold.\n\nSome of them have actually said as much out loud, including Marxist-Anarchist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The New York Post reported:\n\nOcasio-Cortez said the House subcommittee on civil rights she serves on has held hearings over the prior two years on white supremacy and said there are programs to \u201cde-radicalize\u201d brain-washed adherents.\n\nBut she said funding was not a priority for those programs during the Trump years.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are radicalized right now. It\u2019s going to take a very long time to de-radicalize these people and a lot of effort,\u201d she said.\n\nJust a few years ago, she would have been run out of Congress for saying things like that. Now, post-Trump, she not only gets away with it, she is celebrated for it and her thoughts are echoed across other platforms \u2014 including so-called \u201cnews\u201d networks like CNN, whose \u2018media watchdog\u2019 doesn\u2019t even push back on calls to censor competitors.\n\nSee more at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vaccine skeptics now being labeled part of \u201cextremist\u201d groups in latest merger of Big Pharma and the police state government", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2021-01-21-vaccine-skeptics-labeled-extremist-groups-merger-big-pharma-police-state.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "The rise (and success) of President Donald Trump and the threat his tens of millions of supporters pose to the existing establishment order (the deep state) is so immense there is a movement afoot by the powers that be to eliminate them before they grow strong and organized enough to take America back.
