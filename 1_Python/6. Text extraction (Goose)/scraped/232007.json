And we still have the UN Biodiversity Summit to look forward to.\n\nYes, the creepy global gathering season is really hitting its stride, and the participants are making no secret of their global plans moving forward.\n\nYou can read the whole thing here, we\u2019ll just be pulling out a few key quotes.\n\nFor starters let\u2019s take a look at the \u201ctheme\u201d of this year\u2019s summit, which has a very familiar ring to it:\n\nCall me crazy, but that sounds like just another way of saying \u201cbuild back better\u201d, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nYou might expect any declaration made under the \u201cbuild back better\u201d banner to be filled with Great Reset talking points\u2026and you\u2019d be absolutely correct.\n\nThere\u2019s a re-dedication to the ongoing war on food, and an echoing of the COP27 focus on \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201creform\u201d in agriculture [emphasis added throughout]:\n\nTo be clear, \u201cmitigating climate change\u201d means \u201cfarming less meat\u201d; \u201cdiversifying food sources\u201d means \u201ceating bugs\u201d; and \u201cinnovative practices and technologies\u201d means lab-grown meat and/or yeast paste.\n\nThere\u2019s a LOT of material on \u201creversing\u201d or \u201cmitigating\u201d climate change, including overly verbose pledges to \u201creform\u201d energy supplies:\n\nYou don\u2019t need me to translate that.\n\nAnd after that comes the \u201cpandemic preparedness\u201d spiel, calling for a \u201clegally binding instrument\u201d to \u201cstrengthen\u201d global pandemic preparedness:\n\nThat has been on the agenda for a while, you can read our previous pieces on it here and here.\n\nNext there\u2019s the promise to control the internet more strictly, for the sake of \u201csecurity\u201d:\n\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting with bated-breath for them to mention central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), well wait no longer:\n\nFinally \u2013 and probably most concerning of all \u2013 they pledge to introduce international vaccine passports:\n\nThere you have it, the G20 shopping list that includes (but is not limited to): Food reform, energy reform, pandemic legislation, \u201ccyber security\u201d, CBDCs, and vaccine passports/digital ID.\n\nNothing surprising, but unusual to see it all laid out in one document like that.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the more old-fashioned motive \u2013 greed. The \u201cpledge\u201d is riddled with talk of \u201cfunding gaps\u201d, donations, and \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d.\n\nAll of these serve as cover for international money laundering, embezzling, and other ways of funneling tax-payer money into the over-stuffed pockets of the 1%.\n\nOh, a little reminder to those who still believe Russia is fighting the good fight against the globalist baddies in Ukraine \u2013 Russia is a member of the G20 and signed the pledge.\n\nAs did China, along with every other member of BRICS.\n\nThere are no heroes here, they are all in it together\u2026but their war sure made for a good distraction, didn\u2019t it?\n\nBasically, it\u2019s all just confirmation \u2013 if confirmation were needed \u2013 that the Great Reset is still coming. Even if Covid goes away, the new normal is here to stay.\n\nBut, of course, that was always the plan.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "G20\u2019s globalist \u201cpledge\u201d commits to vaccine passports, digital currency & much, much more", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/11/18/g20s-globalist-pledge-commits-to-vaccine-passports-digital-currency-much-much-more/", "description": "Kit Knightly This past week saw G20\u2019s annual meeting taking place in Bali, with the leaders of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies signing a pledge that commits to: \u201cReform\u201d fo\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-11-18T23:00:24+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-06T16:26:44+00:00", "site_name": "OffGuardian", "image": "https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/g20-agenda-cover.jpg", "image:width": "2271", "image:height": "2560", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["CBDCs", "vaccine passports", "G20", "ukraine", "edible insects", "cop27", "BRICS", "lab grown meat", "Poland", "russia", "china"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/63648958", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/11/13/lab-grown-meat-nuclear-yeast-vats-cop27-reignites-the-war-on-food/", "https://www.un.org/en/content/summits2022/", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/16/g20-bali-leaders-declaration/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkcaeaD45MY", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/10/11/pandemic-treaty-reports-of-its-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated/", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/04/19/pandemic-treaty-will-hand-who-keys-to-global-government/", "https://off-guardian.org/2021/10/01/programmable-digital-currency-the-next-stage-of-the-new-normal/", "http://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/world-leaders-agree-to-cattle-tag?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2", "https://ko-fi.com/offguardian", "https://www.subscribestar.com/offguardian", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bitcoin", "https://liberapay.com/OffGuardian/donate", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bank", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-11-18T23:00:24+00:00"}
