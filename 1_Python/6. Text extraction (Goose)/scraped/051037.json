Hotez is now comparing us to terrorists, murderers and illicit nuclear weapons dealers. \n\n\n\nHotez himself, when Trump was still in office, actually said he was against rushing out a covid vaccine because it carried too many risks (he no doubt thought it would help Trump win reelection). \n\n\n\nHere's a quote Hotez gave to Reuters in March 2020:\n\nWhereas Hotez has zero principles, vaccine expert Angus Dalgleish, who originally shilled the vax throughout the media, has now done a complete 180 and is warning everyone he can about a dramatic increase he's seeing in the recurrence of cancer in his patients after taking their boosters.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFrom The Daily Sceptic, \"I Have Tried Sounding the Alarm About the Vaccines Causing Cancer Relapse But the Mainstream Media Don\u2019t Want to Know\":\n\nThe Atlantic featured a similar article in Sept 2022 highlighting how Belgian immunologist Dr. Michel Goldman, a \"lifelong promoter of vaccines,\" experienced \"a brand-new barrage of cancer lesions\u2014so many spots that it looked like someone had set off fireworks\" in his body after getting \"boosted.\"\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOther studies have found organ recipients rejecting transplants they've had for 20 years just days after getting the covid shot.\n\n\n\nFor all we know, it's vax shills who forced these experimental shots on everyone with zero long-term testing that are the real \"major killing force globally.\" \n\n\n\nVax shills have already been forced to admit that their \"100% effective\" precious covid shots completely failed to stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\n\nWhat's going to happen next if they're forced to admit they're destroying people's immune systems?\n\n\n\n[Header image by Larry D.
