Overall, 91.7 percent of California\u2019s pridepox cases are \u201cgay, lesbian or same gender loving,\u201d while another 5.6 percent are \u201cbisexual.\u201d\n\nSo far, nobody in the United States power structure has spoken out against perverse LGBT activity as the primary superspreader vector for pridepox. In fact, the powers that be are going out of their way to deny that LGBTs are responsible for the disease \u2013 which is a far cry from how they treated normal people during the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) plandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from people who are worried about attending events out of fear of contracting monkeypox. We hope you partake while also taking steps to reduce your risk,\u201d announced the AIDS Foundation, adding the politically correct caveat that gays should \u201cbe aware\u201d of pridepox \u201cbut not overly afraid\u201d of it.\n\nThe group says that gays should only \u201cgo to sex parties with people you know\u201d \u2013 this after the entire country, including children, were told to \u201cmask up\u201d and get jabbed to stop the spread of so-called \u201ccovid.\u201d\n\nShould a gay encounter someone at the festival with bumps and rashes, it is best to cover those rashes before engaging in a night of debauchery, the AIDS Foundation added.\n\nRemember when the establishment pulled a similar double standard back in 2020 by declaring church events and schools to be superspreader events but not Black Lives Matter (BLM) riots?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s rallies were also declared to be superspreader events while protests against \u201cpolice brutality\u201d were simultaneously decreed to be safe expressions of \u201cfreedom,\u201d despite the restrictions that were applied to everybody else.\n\n\u201cMonkeypox must not be as big of a problem as they claim if they are okay with allowing this trash festival to proceed,\u201d wrote a commenter in response to the news.\n\n\u201cWatch and see: as soon as this is over, they will be back to screaming about how monkeypox is a \u2018pandemic.\u2019 It\u2019s all lies.\u201d\n\nOver at Natural News, a reader said he absolutely will not shed any tears for these perverts who are insistent upon wiping themselves out. However, who is going to speak up for the rest of society, which could be plunged right back into medical tyranny the moment this summer of pride has ended?\n\nThe latest news about pridepox can be found at Infections.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "San Francisco proudly announces monkeypox superspreader event: the \u201cUp Your Alley\u201d festival that encourages filth and multiple partners", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-08-02-san-francisco-monkeypox-superspreader-up-alley-festival.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Despite an urgent plea from the World Health Organization (WHO) for homosexual and bisexual men to stop their sexual escapades to limit the spread of monkeypox (aka pridepox), the city of San Francisco is moving forward anyway with an LGBT superspreader event called \u201cUp Your Alley.\u201d The sex festival, also known as \u201cDore Alley,\u201d is [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.gender.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/165/2022/08/LGBTQ-Rainbow-Flag-Monkeypox.jpg"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "big government", "national security", "left cult", "outbreak", "gender confused", "demonic", "culture wars", "PridePox", "San Francisco", "monkeypox", "hypocrisy", "infections", "LGBT", "insanity", "evil", "perversion", "gay mafia", "superspreader", "Up Your Alley"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-29-who-tells-lgbt-males-stop-spreading-monkeypox.html", "https://americasfrontlinenews.com/post/san-francisco-plans-monkeypox-superspreader-event-after-declaring-emergency", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-28-monkeypox-cover-covid-vaccine-shingles-blisters-herpes.html", "http://infections.news", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-29-who-tells-lgbt-males-stop-spreading-monkeypox.html", "https://americasfrontlinenews.com/post/san-francisco-plans-monkeypox-superspreader-event-after-declaring-emergency", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fgendernews%2F2022-08-02-san-francisco-monkeypox-superspreader-up-alley-festival.html&linkname=San%20Francisco%20proudly%20announces%20monkeypox%20superspreader%20event%3A%20the%20%E2%80%9CUp%20Your%20Alley%E2%80%9D%20festival%20that%20encourages%20filth%20and%20multiple%20partners", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
