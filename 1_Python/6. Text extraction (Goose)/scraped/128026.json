They\u2019re called glory holes for a reason, people!\n\nOkay. Don\u2019t worry about the monkeypox thing then.\n\nYou can almost feel the public health authorities squirming right now.\n\nOn the one hand, they\u2019ve almost got another epidemic on the go \u2013 the perfect way to distract the shiny-haired robots in the media from the complete failure of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nOn the other, the monkeypox epidemic \u2013 stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before \u2013 very much appears to be centered around the sexual practices of gay men. (And bisexual men, also known as gay men who want to pretend they\u2019re straight.)\n\nIn this, monkeypox joins not just HIV, but syphilis, gonorrhea, and a bunch of other nasties. The state of California \u2013 that hyper-conservative hotspot \u2013 reports that gay men are hundreds of times more likely to get syphilis than straight men or women.\n\nSo, yeah, I know it\u2019s early days on monkeypox.\n\nAnd if you want, you can go full Ding and start screaming that the virus has mutated in some completely unexpected way and is going to KILL US ALL! (Orthopox viruses mutate very slowly by viral standards, by the way, which is why the smallpox vaccine works so well.)\n\nOr you can go full Alex Jones and start screaming about how the DNA/AAV Covid vaccines are giving us monkeypox! (Do you know what happens to my blood pressure when woke morons on Twitter compare me to Alex #@$%TG$ Jones? If I stroke out, you\u2019ll know why.)\n\nOr you can accept the reality that this epidemic probably came out of a couple of gay raves.\n\nThe good news is that the public health authorities are now likely to pivot fast away from trying to scare people about monkeypox, for fear of stigmatizing gay men (by letting them know too much about what happens at these raves). As always, the Onion captured the reality better than any \u201creal\u201d news organization ever could:\n\nAdded bonus: the same epidemiologists who wanted to lock you and your kids up for the last two years for Covid, a disease that poses approximately no risk to them, are now sure to let you know that MANDATES AND GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR NEVER WORK!\n\nYep, without Chinese labs and gay bathhouses, epidemiologists these days wouldn\u2019t have much to do.\n\nLet\u2019s just hope that ne\u2019er the twain shall meet.", "opengraph": {"title": "Is it monkeypox, or crystalmethpox?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-05-25-is-it-monkeypox-or-crystalpox.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Are you a gay man?
