Fauci that two shots of a messenger RNA vaccine fall short of protection amid the highly transmissible omicron variant. [Actually, mRNA effectiveness for infection was already deep in the negative long before \u201cOmicron\u201d.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using the terminology now \u2018keeping your vaccinations up to date,\u2019 rather than what \u2018fully vaccinated\u2019 means,\u201d Fauci said during a National Institutes of Health lecture Tuesday. \u201cRight now, optimal protection is with a third shot of an mRNA or a second shot of a J&J.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called Tuesday for third shots of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine to be administered within five months of the initial two-shot series, shortening the time frame before a booster by a month. A CDC advisory panel is expected to recommend boosters for teenagers in a meeting Wednesday.\n\nEarly studies have indicated a booster of Pfizer Inc.\u2018s vaccine provides a 25-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies that fight the variant, Moderna Inc.\u2018s booster produces a 37-fold increase in antibodies, and two doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2018s vaccine cut hospitalizations in South Africa by 85%. [What is \u201cneutralizing\u201d about these antibodies when viral load in mRNA-treated and untreated is still the same?]\n\nFauci and other health leaders as well as President Joe Biden have pressed for months about the importance of getting both vaccinated and boosted. But the CDC\u2019s definition of fully vaccinated has remained two weeks after the primary dose or doses. That decision has prompted questions at multiple White House press conferences as to whether the agency plans to change the definition of fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to follow that science and it is literally evolving daily. And as that science evolves, we will continue to review the data and update our recommendations as necessary,\u201d CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing Dec. 15.\n\nFauci also said in September that he thinks three doses Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines will likely be the primary series.\n\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made his remarks about new terminology in response to whether the U.S. will start to offer fourth doses the way Israel has.\n\n\u201cWe need to find out what the durability of protection of the third shot is before we start thinking about the fourth shot.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "\u2018Up-to-Date\u2019 Shots Replacing Term \u2018Fully Vaccinated,\u2019 Fauci Says", "description": "That's because mRNA therapies are not vaccines", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/up-to-date-shots-replacing-term-fully-vaccinated-fauci-says/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/106839373-1613063690079-35113486893_8ac554d125_o-750x422.jpg", "image:width": "929", "image:height": "523", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2022-01-06T03:32:52+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-06T03:32:52+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Politics", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/106839373-1613063690079-35113486893_8ac554d125_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2022-01-06T03:32:52+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://demystifyingmedicine.od.nih.gov/", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/coronavirus/cdc-recommends-pfizer-booster-5-months-after-initial-shots-1", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/coronavirus/third-dose-of-pfizer-biontech-shot-key-to-fight-elusive-omicron", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/modernas-third-dose-boosts-antibodies-against-omicron-2", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/two-doses-of-j-js-vaccine-slashed-omicron-hospital-stays-1", "https://aboutblaw.com/065", "https://aboutblaw.com/066", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/pharma-and-life-sciences/mrna-vaccines-will-require-3-doses-from-start-fauci-predicts", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/up-to-date-shots-replacing-term-fully-vaccinated-fauci-says?campaign=64CDD074-6DB9-11EC-B10B-46B84F017A06&utm_medium=lawdesk&utm_source=twitter"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2022-01-06T03:32:52+01:00"}
