When the average person is really starting to question the legitimacy of the government and its \u201cpublic health\u201d impositions, you know something is not quite right.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, a public official narrative was established, and you weren\u2019t allowed to question it \u2013 which, of course, is very detrimental, both to the pandemic and how to deal with the pandemic, because you have to have a vibrant discussion to figure out how best to deal with these things,\u201d Kulldorff told The Epoch Times in a recent interview.\n\nEarly on in the plandemic, you may recall that Kulldorff put himself in the crosshairs by exposing the plandemic for what it was, even when people were still being told that it would just take two weeks to \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d\n\nIn March 2020 when the plandemic first began, Kulldorff, a native of Sweden, was already trying to publish studies showing that the Fauci Flu was really not all that big of a deal. He tried to present evidence of what people could do to help minimize their risk of infection as opposed to just panicking and living in fear.\n\nKulldorff\u2019s research was patently rejected, as you might expect \u2013 but he did not stop fighting. In fact, he has continued to tell the truth, putting his entire career and reputation on the line.\n\n\u201cI was able to publish in Sweden, in the major daily newspapers there during the spring of 2020, so that was not a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the United States was not allowed to have a debate, which is very troubling.\u201d\n\nKulldorff has been fighting the good fight since the beginning of the plandemic\n\nKulldorff\u2019s early efforts culminated in the release of the Great Barrington Declaration, which was published by Drs. Sunetra Gupta and Jay Bhattacharya in October 2020. This declaration called for a more nuanced approach to the plandemic as opposed to the one-size-fits-all restrictions that were forced on primarily Westerners.\n\n\u201cThe most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk,\u201d that declaration states.\n\nGupta, by the way, is an epidemiologist with an expertise in immunology, vaccine development and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases who also works as a professor at the University of Oxford. Bhattacharya is an epidemiologist, health economist and public health policy expert who focuses on infectious diseases and vulnerable populations, and also teaches at the Stanford University Medical System.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the basic fundamental principles of public health that existed in the pandemic preparedness plan that was prepared many years before,\u201d Kulldorff says about the Great Barrington Declaration. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of astonishing that it wasn\u2019t followed from the very beginning of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nKulldorff says that the Great Barrington Declaration was not intended for politicians, scientists or even doctors, despite the fact that thousands of them signed it. Instead, it was intended for the general public.\n\n\u201cThe most important audience was the public,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the public that ultimately will end these misguided public health policies. It\u2019s the public, regular people, who are suffering the consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key thing was to break the pretense that there was scientific consensus for these lockdowns \u2013 which there wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe latest news coverage about the plandemic can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Former Harvard professor warns that \u201cscience and public health are broken\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.eugenics.news/2022-09-12-former-harvard-professor-science-public-health-broken.html", "site_name": "Eugenics News", "description": "Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a prominent epidemiologist and statistician from Harvard University, says that the current paradigm of science and public health is clearly \u201cbroken.\u201d The Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) plandemic has exposed the corruption of the system to a degree not seen perhaps ever.
