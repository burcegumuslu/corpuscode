The prices of both food and shelter rise over 300%. (Continued)\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Russian Subscribers\n\nRussian Intelligence Analysts are reporting today that a vast area of the United States Midwestern Regions have been flooded with Scientists, Military and Intelligence Organizations attempting to stop a massive Anthrax Epidemic that to date has killed (estimated) over 15,000 animals. One news report from this troubled region we can read as reported by the Farm and Ranch News Service in their article titled \"Anthrax case area enlarging\" and which says;\n\n\"On July 6, anthrax was confirmed in two herds in Ransom County,\" said Dr. Beth Carlson, Deputy State Veterinarian. \"Since then several additional cases of the disease have been confirmed in the area, which now includes southern Barnes County. Suspect cases have been reported in eastern Dickey and LaMoure counties as well.\" The anthrax-infected herds have been quarantined and are being vaccinated. Most cases have involved cattle; however, horses, bison, and farmed elk have also been affected. Carlson said anthrax has occurred in this area in the past, however, premises with no previous history of anthrax are being confirmed by the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at North Dakota State University.\"\n\nAnother report from another of the American States affected we can read as reported by the Capital Journal News Service in their article titled \"Anthrax turns up in Sully County buffalo\" and which says, \u201cAnthrax is a very serious quarantinable disease because it can cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time,\u201d said Holland. Holland said there\u2019s really no way to diagnose the disease in a herd other than when animals begin dying. It\u2019s also important that the dead animals are disposed of with care.\u201cAnthrax is also communicable to humans, as well as other animals, through carcasses,\u201d said Holland, who added that it was vital that proper measures were taken to dispose of the dead animals. Holland said that while this is the first case in South Dakota, North Dakota has had about 21 herds affected by the disease.\"\n\nThough not completely eradiated in the United States, an outbreak on the scale currently occurring there, and their Military Governments massive response, can only lead one to the suspicion that this present outbreak is related to terrorism, and as reported by Dr. Kari A. Mergenhagen of the United States University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in her report titled \"Anthrax Attack: A Case on Bioterrorism\" and which says;\n\n\"Today the CIA intercepted and translated a tape-recording of a known terrorist group. Please listen to it closely. The survival of the United States may depend on your ability to circumvent terrorist transactions and institute appropriate actions to minimize casualties should an attack occur such as described on this tape. \"The videotape portrayed a group of men and women crowded around a table in a poorly lit, non-descript room.\n\nSeveral faces were easily recognizable as key terrorist leaders from around the world. They were planning a biological attack on the United States. Their voices resonated with chilling determination as they unfolded their plan. The Americans have degraded us, humiliated us.\n\nThe time has come for revenge.\" The man identified as Miguel Haq slammed his fist into the table. \"The plan we have developed is precise, meticulous. Working together, we can execute it,\" Armed Shaw said. Armed was a young man, well groomed, with blue eyes and a shock of red hair. \"The United States may be technologically advanced, but we have something that will bring them to their knees. \"\"My work during World War II on 'Operation Vegetarian' will be of use in executing this plan,\" volunteered Helen Shank, an elderly, shrewd looking woman.\" Indeed, your contribution is crucial to the success of our plan,\" Haq replied as he stroked his graying beard.\n\n\"Helen helped develop the top secret plan for 'Operation Vegetarian's against Germany when she worked under the British crown. Jacques Franc also provided support for that effort. Jacques is an expert in biological weapons. He has been working as a U.S. military microbiologist and intelligence expert researching covert biological operations. His expertise and commitment to our cause have allowed us to gain the wisdom necessary to further our plan.\" \"We have chosen anthrax, Bacillus anthracis, to disseminate the destruction. Anthrax is inexpensive, difficult to detect, incredibly stable, and very deadly. Much of the U.S. military has been vaccinated against it, but the vaccine is short lived\u2014and the military is not our target anyway. Our goal is to kill civilians on a massive scale while at the same time crippling the beef and dairy industry, causing a major disruption of the economy and spreading fear and pandemonium across the United States.\u201d\n\n\"November is flu season. By the time they realize that anthrax is the cause of their unexplained illnesses and fatalities, many of the people exposed will be as good as dead. Antibiotics are only effective before symptoms occur. Anthrax will be disseminated across America from 'sea to shining sea.' No one from any other country will want to visit America for fear of getting the disease. The media will be our unsuspecting ally. They will dutifully report that some spores can survive for over 40 years. When it is discovered where this strain originated from, the Americans will blame the Soviet Union and seek revenge. There will be widespread fear and panic. The United States will be ruined,\"\n\nRussian Intelligence Reports also state the media organs have been ordered to \u2018blackout\u2019 the news of these Anthrax Attacks due to what their Military Leaders say is a \u201cNational Security Assure\u201d. The effect of these Western media \u2018blackouts\u2019 of information to their peoples is most effective, and as evidenced by the suppression from the citizens in Britain the correct news of the biological bombs that exploded in their transportation systems this past week.\n\nRussian Scientists further report that these continued attacks against all modes of transportation in these Western Nations presently at war have served to indoctrinate into their peoples a mass fear of travel by any means. Once these fears have been firmly established, say Russian Scientists, these peoples will happily give up their freedoms, including their freedoms to travel.\n\nMost sadly this is now true in the United States, and as we can read as reported by the Washington Post News Service in their article titled \"New York's Subway Riders Face Bag Checks With Somber Tolerance\" and which says, \"Few of the subway passengers objected to the idea that an officer might buttonhole them and ask to peer into their bags. The congenitally contentious New Yorker of legend was a muted presence. Police said few riders refused the searches, and some even voluntarily gave their bags over for scrutiny. \"I'd rather be watched and alive than dead with my privacy intact,\" Frank Majowicz, a businessman from Toms River, N.J., said as he hauled a shoulder bag off the Times Square shuttle.\"\n\nTo the knowing of these Westerners that these actions are not meant for their protection, but rather for their control they do not even see, even when it is directly pointed out to them, and as we can read as evidenced from another passage in that news report which says;\n\n\"Police officials took pains Friday to describe the searches as entirely random, hoping to allay fears of racial profiling. \"We are looking at backpack size or containers large enough to house explosives that we know have been used in these mass transit attacks,\" said Paul J. Browne, chief spokesman for the city police. \"The protocol would be to pick the fifth backpack in each group of 10. If a Middle Eastern man is number four, he would not get checked.\"\n\nIt is appalling to think of the tragic consequences that could have occurred in London yesterday should the London Police had adopted a similar like method of security used by the New York Police and the bomber who now lies dead in a London morgue would have been \u2018number four\u2019.\n\nBut to the absurdities of these Western peoples lives turned into a comic farce they do not even see, or more importantly they do not even care. But to the perils they currently face in this Global War there is no comics, nor farce, only death and destruction. If only these Western peoples could see this.\n\n\u00a9 July 23, 2005, EU and US all rights reserved.\n\n[Ed.
