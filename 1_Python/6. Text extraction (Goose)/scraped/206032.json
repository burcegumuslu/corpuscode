Failure to comply means they may be punished or potentially lose their jobs. After hearing about the plight of officers in Chicago, officials in the neighboring state of Indiana are throwing the doors open to disgruntled cops, with the assurance that their rights as American citizens will not be violated.\n\nAs of Oct. 15, all of the Chicago Police Department\u2019s 12,000 or so officers are required to report their vaccination status. Those who chose not to get vaccinated are required to get tested for COVID-19 twice weekly. Non-compliance will result in a \u201cno pay\u201d status.\n\nAccording to Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown, 67 percent of officers have already entered their information into the city\u2019s database. Out of those, 82 percent are vaccinated.\n\nIn a now-deleted tweet, Indiana State Police spokesman Sgt. Glen Fifield welcomed cops from Chicago. The tweet read: \u201cHey Chicago police officers, we\u2019re hiring! No vaccine mandate \u2026 lower taxes, great schools, welcoming communities.\u201d\n\nChicago police officers who don\u2019t follow the vaccine mandate can have their pay and powers suspended. To date, at least 21 officers were already facing those consequences, said Brown. At least 4,000 officers have yet to disclose their vaccine status. (Related: The vaccine mandate is a hoax, and no entity or person in America is obliged to follow it.)\n\nChicago\u2019s Fraternal Order of Police has criticized coronavirus vaccine mandates. Members have even clashed with city officials on the issue publicly and encouraged officers to practice their freedom of choice and not comply.\n\nOne judge has already ordered John Catanzara, the local union president, to stop making statements. The city\u2019s attorney also accused Catanzara of \u201cmunicipal sedition and treason.\u201d\n\nEarlier in October, Catanzara said Chicagoans should expect \u201ca lot less officers on the street\u201d because of oppressive coronavirus mandates.\n\nSome Indiana officials have offered to help police officers in Chicago, even promising that vaccination won\u2019t be a requirement if they seek employment in the state. Sen. Mike Braun took to Twitter to offer support to police officers from Chicago.\n\nBraun said his office \u201cstands ready to help connect Chicago police officers to an Indiana police department that is hiring now and doesn\u2019t have a vaccine mandate.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Braun said Chicago\u2019s police officers \u201cdeserve respect\u201d that they aren\u2019t being shown, and they won\u2019t suffer the same \u201cgovernment overreach\u201d in Indiana. Police officers have one of the hardest jobs and they deserve respect instead of losing their pay or being fired for not complying with a strict vaccine mandate, added Braun.\n\nSteve Scheckel, chief of police in Munster, Indiana, echoed Braun\u2019s sentiment. He expressed his desire to help officers who want a \u201cbetter quality of life for their family\u201d after being fired from their jobs.\n\nScheckel said his department, which doesn\u2019t have a vaccine mandate, has already employed one officer from Chicago. While Munster is 30 minutes away from Chicago, Scheckel said that it\u2019s rated one of the 10 safest cities in the state of Indiana.\n\nCatanzara clarified that police officers are not refusing to protect the citizens of Chicago. Instead, the city is refusing to let them protect the citizens of the state by enforcing the vaccine mandate without considering their right to health freedom.\n\nIf officers lose their jobs because of the vaccine mandate, several suburban counties surrounding Chicago said that their police departments will not help police the city.\n\nVisit Pandemic.news for more articles related to vaccine mandates and coronavirus pandemic.", "opengraph": {"title": "Indiana recruits Chicago police officers who are fed up with oppressive coronavirus mandates", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2021-10-27-indiana-welcomes-chicago-police-officers-coronavirus-mandates.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "Chicago police officers are being forced to get vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and report their vaccination status.
