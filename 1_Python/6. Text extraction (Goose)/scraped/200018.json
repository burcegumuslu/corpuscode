Whether your pet is dealing with a neurological condition, cancer, a thyroid problem, bad breath, or anything else, there are steps you can take to support them and improve their health.\n\nThere are a number of health issues you have to watch out for as a pet owner. Working with a compassionate, understanding veterinarian is crucial. Some people opt for a holistic vet, while others choose a more conventionally-minded veterinarian. Today many veterinarians seem to be implementing a mix of allopathic and holistic ideas in their practices. Find someone you love and respect.\n\nDr. Jeff Feinman is a brilliant and compassionate holistic veterinarian who offers a number of incredible resources, informative materials and online support on his website holisticactions.com. Consider joining his online Holistic Pet Care Community, where you\u2019ll be part of empowering online meetings.\n\nIf you have a pet in your life, you probably already know in your heart and soul that they make wonderful therapy companions. Whether it\u2019s a dog, cat, bird, horse, rabbit, or other cuddly critter, your pet can help you heal:\n\u2022 Pets stimulate your immune system and can play a part in helping heal disease and illness.\n\u2022 Your natural killer cells can become more responsive when you\u2019re around your pets.\n\u2022 Your platelets are also responsive, and a pet in your life can positively stimulate platelet production if you\u2019re struggling with a low platelet condition.\n\u2022 A pet can help your adrenals calm down and balance out.\n\nYes, there are temporary, infrequent moments where you\u2019ll have frustration with your pet. But these stressors are outweighed by the countless moments where your pet brings healing for your adrenals, immune system, and more.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a pet, but you scratch the back of your neighbor's dog or pet your friend\u2019s cat, you\u2019re still stimulating your immune system. Just touching or briefly cuddling an animal can elicit positive responses in the body.\n\nMany animals develop cysts, tumors, and nodules during their lifetimes. Lipomas, which are fatty tumors, can grow quite large in both cats and dogs. Tiny tentacle-like roots extend out from the tumor in search of food. Consequently, if you feed your animals toxic foods that fuel the lipoma, its roots will draw these foods in and it will keep growing. Taking certain toxic foods out of your pet\u2019s diet can halt the lipoma\u2019s growth.\n\nGMO foods are especially problematic fuel for lipomas and can trigger aggressive growth, so make your pet\u2019s diet GMO-free if possible. If your pet has serious lipoma issues, a grain-free diet is ideal. If you can only afford to feed your pet food that contains some unproductive ingredients, don\u2019t stress yourself out. I know you\u2019re doing the best you possibly can.\n\nAdding these supplements to your pet\u2019s daily routine can help prevent and slow down the growth of lipomas:\n\nIf your pet badly itches and bites their fur out in certain places, they may be suffering from hot spots. Typically hot spots are a reaction to something in the animal\u2019s diet. Try switching your pet\u2019s food to better choices, but know it may take six to eight weeks to notice changes. If you don\u2019t notice any difference after this period of time, try changing your pet\u2019s food a second time. Then reassess, and if you\u2019re still not seeing changes, switch up the diet a third time.\n\nOftentimes, unhealthy food, such as food with fillers or other unproductive ingredients, plays a part in the development of hot spots. Changing up food, even if it\u2019s clean, healthy food, can help break up the hot spot and fur loss cycle. Bringing vitamin C into your pet\u2019s daily protocol can help heal the wounds.\n\nHelping your pet heal from a UTI can be challenging, and chronic UTIs can be especially painful for an animal.\n\u2022 Vitamin C is an essential preventative measure that builds your pet\u2019s immune system.\n\u2022 Pau d\u2019arco is great for UTI support and helps with teeth problems.\n\u2022 A tiny bit of propolis can be helpful for UTIs, teeth issues, and gum infections.\n\u2022 Adding small amounts of fresh oregano and parsley into your pet\u2019s food can also help with UTIs.\n\nIf your pet suffers from heart disease or vascular issues, it\u2019s critical to provide him or her with coenzyme Q10 and vitamin C. From here, work with your holistic veterinarian to figure out what particular supplements your pet needs.\n\nHow I Care For My Dogs\n\nBelow I\u2019ll share some things I do to care for my dogs. Hopefully this information provides you with some new ideas and insights, regardless of the kind of pet you own. Talk to your veterinarian about which practices would be best for your pet.\n\nI\u2019ve fed raw meat, vegetables and fruits to every dog I\u2019ve had since childhood. Over thirty years ago, this was considered reckless and dangerous. Fortunately, this particular diet has grown immensely popular in recent years. Now raw food and dehydrated raw food line the shelves of pet stores, and almost all conventional and holistic vets praise this dietary option.\n\nMy dogs have always had good results from eating raw, grass-fed meat. Try your best to avoid factory-farmed meat, and stick with high-quality, grass-fed varieties whenever possible. Instead of purchasing ground meat, opt for a whole, grass-fed selection, which typically contains less bacteria.\n\nIn various Medical Medium resources, I\u2019ve mentioned the seven acids that make up your stomach's hydrochloric acid. This blend is unique to humans. Dogs have their own blend, which is made up of twenty acids, and cats have a similar combination. Science and research have yet to discover the truth about our stomach\u2019s hydrochloric acid blends.\n\nIf your pet is a carnivore, he or she may really enjoy and benefit from raw meaty bones. Marrow bones, which are loaded with minerals that are ideal for dogs, cats, and other carnivorous pets, are particularly incredible. The mineral composition inside these bones can transform the health of your pet. You can always consult your vet if you wish to feed your pets raw meaty bones. It\u2019s important to never feed your pet cooked bones because they can splinter and be hazardous, plus they can\u2019t be digested.\n\nIf you\u2019ve always fed your pet cooked meat and veggies but haven\u2019t ever encountered food-related health issues, you can definitely continue providing your pet with a cooked diet (with the exception of cooked bones). Sweet potatoes can be an especially great cooked vegetable option. If health issues do arise, you may want to try bringing in some raw food.\n\nThere are many high-quality raw food sources today, including:\n\u2022 The Honest Kitchen company sells raw, dehydrated cat food and dog food. You simply add a little water and have a tasty, wholesome dish for your pet in no time.\n\nIn addition to the raw meat, I give my dogs homemade meals. Around lunchtime, I make my dogs a mash by throwing an apple and two celery sticks into the food processor for each dog. I often add a little barley grass juice extract powder and a little B-12 with methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin as well.\n\nI try to incorporate wild blueberries into my dogs\u2019 diet every day. I often grind a pint of defrosted frozen wild blueberries in their lunchtime mash. Sprinkling a touch of flaxseed meal or chia seed meal into your dog\u2019s food will help protect their immune system (note that too much of either seed may cause bloating).\n\nAround dinnertime, I give my dogs larger-sized, raw, meaty, marrow bones. I let them chew on the bones a bit, rip off some meat, and lick out some of the marrow. After that, I push the rest of the marrow out of the bone with my thumb and give it to them. I try to ensure they don\u2019t crunch too much of the bone because it could be problematic if they accidentally swallowed a large piece.\n\nFruit is incredibly beneficial for your health and your pet\u2019s health. Whether you have a puppy or a full grown dog, try giving your pooch a few different pieces of fruit, such as bananas, papaya, berries, apples, and pears whenever you can.\n\nFruit can help support your pet\u2019s nervous system, help prevent and discontinue the growth of lipomas, and assist in the prevention and reversal of cancers. The antioxidants in fruits will support your animal\u2019s immune system, and just a little fruit each day can do wonders for your pet\u2019s health!\n\nMy dogs eat veggies as well. They also love to munch on celery, which is an herb, and each of them eats around four to five sticks per day. I give them a few veggies after their morning meal of grass-fed beef and again in the afternoon after they devour their marrow bones. Cucumber is another favorite snack of theirs.\n\nIt\u2019s alright for your dog or cat to eat a little grass if they go outside, as long as you don\u2019t spray your yard with dangerous chemicals or live in a community that sprays. You may even want to grow a wheatgrass bed indoors for your cat. Sometimes when dogs and cats feel sick or unwell, they try to eat a large quantity of grass in an attempt to make themselves throw up, but this can actually create a dangerous blockage in your pet\u2019s intestinal tract. Try to prevent too much outside grass consumption. Let your vet know if your pet is overeating grass outside, or seek support online with a resource like Holistic Actions.\n\nAn amazing way to bring greens into your animal\u2019s life is to add a little barley grass juice powder into their food.\n\nIf your only choice is between low-quality, GMO dog food that contains fillers, byproducts, and chemicals versus homemade dog food that contains grains, I\u2019d recommend the grain-containing homemade dog food. You could combine cooked brown rice with a bit of sweet potato, winter squash, broccoli, or celery and make a meal that\u2019s significantly better than store-bought GMO food. However, if you can provide grain-free meal options, that\u2019s ideal. I like keeping my dog\u2019s diet grain-free, but there are some animals that are dependent on grains\u2014it\u2019s important to keep your unique pet in mind when creating a diet plan.\n\nSome people feed their dogs or cats a vegan diet. This type of diet can be beneficial short-term if you\u2019re trying to reverse an illness, but alongside the vegan diet it\u2019s critical to provide wild salmon oil. Because cats and dogs are carnivores, they cannot thrive on a regular vegan diet. You can find the wild salmon oil I recommend on the Medical Medium preferred pet products page.\n\nAddressing any deficiencies your pet may have is essential. Consider:\n\u2022 SeaMeal\u2122, a kelp-based supplement that provides your pet with some essential vitamins and minerals.\n\u2022 Barley grass juice powder sprinkled into daily meals to help with deficiencies.\n\u2022 B-12 with methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin can bring a positive shift in your pet\u2019s health, and it\u2019s especially important if your pet is suffering from neurological or nervous system problems. Just a few drops can help, though if your pet is larger, a couple more drops may be beneficial.\n\u2022 Vitamin C can support a number of health problems, including neurological and central nervous system issues.\n\u2022 A drop or two of high-quality zinc can be helpful for animals, especially those with thyroid disease. Thyroid disease in animals is similar to thyroid disease in humans. I share the true, unknown cause of Hashimoto\u2019s disease, which is Epstein-Barr virus, and other undiscovered truths about thyroid conditions in Thyroid Healing.\n\u2022 Glucosamine and chondroitin, though I\u2019ve never seen them provide abundant support for serious joint and arthritis problems in humans, can be highly supportive in animals.\n\u2022 MSM also seems to work even more effectively for pets than humans.\n\u2022 Rescue Remedy\u2019s alcohol-free tincture for helping to keep pets calm and cool is helpful.\n\nThe Medical Medium preferred pet products page highlights high quality supplements, including the line of alcohol-free, veterinary herbal extracts by Hawaii Pharm.\n\nThere are some foods pets should not eat:\n\u2022 Some varieties of avocado, such as those grown in the West Indies and the larger avocado varieties found in Florida, aren\u2019t safe for your pet. (A regular Hass avocado is OK).\n\u2022 Macadamia nuts should not be fed to dogs or cats.\n\u2022 Chocolate is poisonous to cats and dogs.\n\u2022 Tinctures that contain alcohol should be avoided, unless that\u2019s all you have to work with.\n\nOur pets mean so much to us. Some people describe their pet as their baby, child, or best friend. Our animals are some of our closest companions and have been there through the best and worst moments of our lives.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take care of your sweet animals and provide for their health, but it\u2019s also important to support your own health so that your pets have the healthiest, most vibrant parent possible.
