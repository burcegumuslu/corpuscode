The Japanese researchers threatened the government that additional lawsuits would be filed for the COVID vaccine harm cover-up.\n\n\u201cOne more thing, pathological autopsies have already been conducted on people who died after receiving the vaccine. However, the Health Ministry is still unwilling to acknowledge the causal link between the vaccine and the deaths. If the health ministry maintains this unjustified position, we intend to file additional lawsuits in consultation with our lawyers,\u201d said Fukushima\n\n\u201cWe demand the Health Ministry provides appropriate victim compensation based on the vaccination law. In other words, the victim is compensated based on the vaccination law that is properly stipulated by Japanese law,\u201d he continued.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter on what he would say to medical professionals who provide vaccines to patients, he responded:\n\nI want to say one thing very clearly to the Health Ministry in addition to the medical professionals. They should distribute a Vaccination Victim\u2019s Handbook to everyone who has been vaccinated. The Vaccination Victim\u2019s Handbook is similar to the Atomic Bomb Victim\u2019s Handbook, which is distributed to survivors of atomic bombs. After distributing the vaccination victims handbook to vaccinated people, medical institutions should be encouraged to properly follow up with vaccinated people.\n\nIt is necessary to examine whether there is a link between the disease and the vaccine. Biopsy tests should be performed on sick people suspected a vaccine-induced illness.\n\nProf. Fukushima added, \u201cVaccines are four times more likely to be infected than non-vaccinated people. Mortality rates were also found to be higher among vaccinated people of all ages. The evidence to promote vaccination has been lost. The state has hidden and stopped disclosing inconvenient data. It is a serious national crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Gateway Pundit reported on January 2o23 that doctors in Japan are now investigating the link between the experimental Covid vaccine and the unprecedented numbers of people dying suddenly.\n\nTwo more professors are speaking out against the vaccine.\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\u2022 Swedish study says Children who catch a Cold without Vaccines develop Natural Immunity\n\u2022 Japanese Officials Urge Govt To Tell The Truth About Excess Deaths Following Covid Vaccines\n\u2022 Twitter Mods Were Ordered to Censor 'TRUE Content That MIGHT Promote Vaccine Hesitancy'\n\nDid you like this information?
