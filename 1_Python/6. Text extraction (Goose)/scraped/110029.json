But we have to remember, so are the people solving them,\u201d Gates emphasized. Our foundation will continue to support solutions in health, agriculture and other critical areas and the systems to get them out of the labs and to the people who need them.\u201d\n\nHowever, critics believe that these \u201ccharitable works\u201d are tied to ideological agendas \u2013 especially since the billionaire\u2019s foundation has been associated with the promotion of abortion, which stands in sharp contrast to the predominantly pro-life culture of many African countries. (Related: Melinda Gates makes a $375 MILLION donation to the abortion industry to accelerate DEPOPULATION of blacks.)\n\nCoalition of pro-life nations commemorate second anniversary of Geneva Consensus Declaration\n\nOn the same day of Gates\u2019 visit to Kenya, a coalition of governments promoting women\u2019s health policy convened at the U.S. Capitol to commemorate the second anniversary of the Geneva Consensus Declaration, an anti-abortion declaration cosponsored by the governments of Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Uganda and the United States.\n\nThe 36 countries across five continents that signed the declaration are bound by the belief that women\u2019s health should not be held hostage by ideological agendas and supports both women and unborn children in the pursuit of actual health care. The U.S. was a founding member of the coalition, but its membership was withdrawn by President Joe Biden immediately upon taking office.\n\nThe ambassador of Hungary to the U.S. Szabolcs Tak\u00e1cs said during the occasion that the Hungarian government holds firm to the view that \u201cevery human being should have the right to life \u2026 and fetal life shall be subject to protection from the moment of conception.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Alfonso Qui\u00f1onez of Guatemala agreed. \u201cLife starts at conception. For us there is no question,\u201d he said. Qui\u00f1onez also relayed the message of Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, that their country \u201cwill continue to fight for life in all stages from conception to natural death.\u201d\n\nThe ambassador cited recent efforts of Guatemala to combat abortion activism at the United Nations as a testament to their pro-life commitment.\n\nMeanwhile, an opinion piece published by LifeNews stated: \u201cBig donors such as the Gates Foundation and the U.S. government should take heed of the Geneva Consensus. Governments at the receiving end of their \u2018help\u2019 can speak for themselves, and together, they are speaking loud and clear that every person is born with inherent dignity and the right to life, and real women\u2019s health gains should never be held hostage by the abortion agenda.\u201d\n\nFollow Genocide.news for more stories related to the globalists\u2019 moves to push depopulation.\n\nWatch Bill Gates admit his involvement in depopulation programs in the video below.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBill Gates funded the creation of a \u201cvaccine passport\u201d tracking system long before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Bill Gates globalist vaccine depopulation agenda\u2026 as revealed by Robert F.
