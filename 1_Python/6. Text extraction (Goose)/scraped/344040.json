The purpose of this post is to examine the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns at the front end.\n\nThe main advances in combating disease over the last 200 years have been better food and clean drinking water. Improved sanitation, reductions in overcrowding and better living conditions also contribute. This is also borne out in published peer-reviewed research:\n\u2022 \u201cThe questionable contribution of medical measures to the decline of mortality in the United States in the twentieth century\u201c. McKinlay JB, McKinlay SM, Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc. 1977 Summer; 55(3): 405-28.\n\u2022 \u201cSymposium: Accomplishments in Child Nutrition during the 20th Century. Infant Mortality in the 20th Century, Dramatic but Uneven Progress\u201d Myron E. Wegman School of Public Health, University of Michigan: J. Nutr. 131: 401S\u2013408S, 2001\n\nData from the U.K. shows that mortality from diphtheria was in steady decline up until the nationwide vaccination program got underway in 1940-1941. You will notice a great reduction in the afllication between 1941 and 1946. You should also notice that mortality among infants did not experience a similar decline.\n\nAdditionally, vaccinations were not universal and nowhere near the level of 80-85% necessary for herd immunization. By the end of 1941, 36% of school-age children had been immunized, but only about 19% of younger children [British Journal of Nursing October 1948 p. 121].\n\nAt least half the children under age 10 had not been vaccinated prior to 1946. Notice that in 1944, the U.K. instituted an active health program of free medical checkups, free school milk (vitamin A) and subsidized meals. In 1948, the U.K. also introduced widespread health reform, which would have been a factor in completely knocking out diphtheria.\n\nBy 1946, diphtheria had disappeared in the non-infant population, but the U.K. government launched in 1946-47 a \u201ccatch-up\u201d diphtheria vaccination campaign. A total of 1.24 million previously unvaccinated children were vaccinated even though diphtheria was already effectively eradicated except for infants. And still, older children are being vaccinated for diphtheria to this very day.\n\nWhooping cough was also subjected to vaccination campaigns. The campaigns started after the cough had trendlined downward for years. Like diphtheria, the vaccine was administered starting in 1940-41. Full \u201cherd immunity\u201d levels were not achieved until 1951. By 1955, whooping cough was effectively eradicated. Was it the vaccine, or was it simply the trend of better health conditions? Looks like the vaccine proponents were doing victory dances after the game was essentially already won. People continue to be vaccinated for whooping cough to this very day.\n\nIncredibly, a vaccine was introduced for measles in 1964, after it was effectively eradicated.\n\nThe current vaccine fad is rubella. A graph for rubella mortality is not included because death from rubella over the last century was so rare that the figures are insufficient to plot on a graph.\n\nTo conclude, let\u2019s examine two afflictions that were not subjected to vaccination programs: scarlet fever and typhoid. Both fizzled out under their own steam about the same time as diphteria and whooping cough.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Star Chamber Justice", "The 5G Beast", "Neoliberals", "Battle Against Degeneracy", "Scamdemic", "Sub-Zero Kakistocracy", "Greenwashing", "(p)Harma Industry Skulduggery", "Faux Democracy & Voting Fraud", "9/11", "Astute Commentary", "True Crime", "Banksters / Financial Manipulations", "Muslim Demonization Agitprop", "Race Industry", "You Can't Make This Stuff Up", "Jewish Power & Influence", "Control of the Internet", "Cultural Marxism", "GMO & Toxins", "Suppressed & Hidden History", "Debt Slavery", "Brainwashing & Propaganda", "Neocons", "Identitarians", "Grand Solar Minimum / Cold Sun", "Threats to South African Whites", "Social Engineering", "Staged Deceptions & False Flags", "White Demonization Agitprop", "Migration as Weaponized War", "Transhumanist Scheming", "Media Lies & Fabrications", "Economic Statecraft", "Fight Club Memes & Tactics", "George Soros Skullduggery", "Israel & Zionism", "Suppression of Free Speech", "Globalization", "New Underworld Order", "Police State / Big Brother"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/rosner/g8965/client_edit/readings/week_2/mckinlay.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22McKinlay%20JB%22%5BAuthor%5D&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstract", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22McKinlay%20SM%22%5BAuthor%5D&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstract", "http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/131/2/401S.pdf", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/05/western-populations-continue-to-be-vaccinated-for-illnesses-that-no-longer-exist-in-western-countries/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2022%2F05%2Fwestern-populations-continue-to-be-vaccinated-for-illnesses-that-no-longer-exist-in-western-countries%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F06%2Fvials_syringes.jpg%3Ffit%3D600%252C350%26ssl%3D1&description=Western%20Populations%20Continue%20to%20Be%20Vaccinated%20for%20Illnesses%20That%20No%20Longer%20Exist%20in%20Western%20Countries", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Western%20Populations%20Continue%20to%20Be%20Vaccinated%20for%20Illnesses%20That%20No%20Longer%20Exist%20in%20Western%20Countries&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2022%2F05%2Fwestern-populations-continue-to-be-vaccinated-for-illnesses-that-no-longer-exist-in-western-countries%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/05/western-populations-continue-to-be-vaccinated-for-illnesses-that-no-longer-exist-in-western-countries/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/05/western-populations-continue-to-be-vaccinated-for-illnesses-that-no-longer-exist-in-western-countries/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
