To this end, he included Deputy Attorney General Roi Sheindorf and Pfizer\u2019s legal adviser in the call.\n\nThe upshot of the conference call, the PMO said, is that a deal between the State of Israel and Pfizer will be signed in the coming days.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of Pfizer\u2019s announcement on Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine has a 90 percent efficacy rate\u2014which Netanyahu referred to as \u201can important day in the global struggle against coronavirus.\u201d\n\nSeveral other companies were making progress toward a vaccine, he said, including Israel, but still required more time.\n\nNevertheless, he added, \u201c0ne thing is clear. Not long from today\u2014it will not be years but months\u2014there will be vaccines that will be available for the population of the world. My goal at the moment is to do one thing\u2014bring vaccines to you, citizens of Israel, and we will do so. This means that the end is in view. I said a few days ago that I see light at the end of the tunnel. I think that train is already exiting the tunnel.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Netanyahu removes 'Bureaucratic Hurdles' to bring Covid Vaccine to Israel", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he\u2019s removed bureaucratic impediments to inking a deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/341824/netanyahu-removes-bureaucratic-hurdles-to-bring-covid-vaccine-to-israel/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2020-11-12T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/F200402YS31-1-880x495-1.jpg", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["JNS"], "publish_date": "2020-11-12T00:00:00+00:00"}
