Now, however, they have changed their minds. (Related: Email reveals Fauci flagged an op-ed denouncing social distancing in schools.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really a new way of thinking about who is going to get infected,\u201d said Jha. \u201cWe used to spend a lot of time talking about six feet of distance, 15 minutes of being together. We realize that\u2019s actually not the right way to think about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we know about this virus, particularly these very contagious subvariants that are out there right now, it is really about the quality of air you\u2019re breathing around you,\u201d Jha claimed. \u201cIn a crowded indoor space with poor ventilation, you can be infected within minutes.\u201d\n\nJha went on to claim that good ventilation is more important than maintaining six feet of distance, and going outdoors might be a good way of not getting infected with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIf you are outdoors with, obviously, by definition, good ventilation, you can be outside for long periods of time and not get infected,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, context matters. Crowds matter. Ventilation matters. That is a major new update in the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance.\u201d\n\nNew CDC guidance on preventing infection is nothing new\n\nKyle Becker, writing for Becker News, noted that the CDC\u2019s updated COVID-19 guidance is \u201cnothing new\u201d and \u201cshould look very familiar to people whose COVID response was managed by governors in states like Texas and Florida.\u201d\n\nAccording to the new guidance:\n\u2022 Individuals exposed to the coronavirus are no longer required to quarantine.\n\u2022 Unvaccinated individuals will abide by similar guidelines as vaccinated people.\n\u2022 Children who are exposed to the coronavirus do not have to be pulled out of class pending COVID-19 testing.\n\u2022 People exposed to COVID-19 but remain asymptomatic no longer have to be tested.\n\n\u201cThis guidance acknowledges that the pandemic is not over, but also helps us move to a point where COVID-19 no longer severely disrupts our daily lives,\u201d said senior CDC scientist Greta Massetti. \u201cWe know that COVID-19 is here to stay.\u201d\n\nMassetti further commended the CDC for bringing recommendations for unvaccinated people in line with the vaccinated. This, she said, is an acknowledgment by the agency of the high levels of immunity to the coronavirus in the United States. She added that this is granted to the population by natural immunity and by so-called vaccine immunity.\n\n\u201cBased on the latest [data] \u2026 it\u2019s around 95 percent of the population,\u201d said Massetti. \u201cAnd so it really makes the most sense to not differentiate.\u201d\n\nDr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, noted that the CDC\u2019s latest update represents the agency\u2019s turn to putting a greater emphasis on giving individuals \u2013 even children \u2013 the freedom to make their own decisions about the level of risk they want to take and how they want to mitigate that risk.\n\n\u201cThat is consistent with where we are in the pandemic right now,\u201d said Plescia. \u201cI don\u2019t really think there are many state or local jurisdictions that are feeling [like] they\u2019re going to need to start making [new] mandates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was ample scientific literature from the beginning to demonstrate that it was extremely unlikely to get COVID outdoors,\u201d wrote Becker. He also criticized CDC teaching on vaccines, which he said \u201cnever stopped viral transmission.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never made sense to screen people for asymptomatic transmission with routine PCR testing. It is \u2018very rare\u2019 for COVID to spread through surface contact. Masks don\u2019t stop airborne viruses. The list goes on and on. Add \u2018social distancing\u2019 to the list.\u201d\n\nRead more news about COVID-19 at Pandemic.news.\n\nWatch this episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, interviews Kristen Megan about the junk science behind masks and social distancing.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBirx admits she and Fauci made up \u201cthe science\u201d on social distancing, lockdowns.\n\nFormer FDA commissioner says six-feet social distancing rule is arbitrary, \u201cnobody knows where it came from.\u201d\n\nTargeting the next generation: Children\u2019s book publishers pummeling kids with fear-based propaganda about sickness, masks and social distancing.\n\nNew study claims that six-foot social distancing rule indoors is ineffective in preventing coronavirus transmission.\n\nMasks, social distancing and virtual learning are really about the installation of COMMUNISM in America.", "opengraph": {"title": "White House COVID official admits six feet social distancing rule is MADE UP", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2022-10-04-covid-official-social-distancing-rule-made-up.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "Another leading White House Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic official has admitted that the federal government\u2019s six-feet social distancing rule is not based on actual science.
