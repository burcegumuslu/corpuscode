Dr. Day, for those of you who are not familiar with her story, was the Chief of Orthopedic Surgery at USF, a prestigious hospital in San Francisco, when she developed cancer. With only hours left to live she had a surprising vision, especially for an agnostic. The image of Jesus appeared before her and asked her if she wanted to live. \u201cYes,\u201d was her answer, and she was shown the tenets of building a strong immune system and peaceful life. She followed this information and, over time, completely recovered. Today, she researches and guides others as to the dangers of putting our children and ourselves in the care of doctors, especially where vaccines are concerned.\n\nThe information in this interview is designed to inform you rather than scare you \u2013 the initial impact may speed up your heart rate or challenge you but this is important information to know about and Lorraine is a straight talker. Remember that she is a trained surgeon and to her, understanding the body and medicine is second nature. She is also married to a retired congressman and her understanding of the political agenda comes from credible sources.", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.gaia.com/video/lorraine-day-vaccines-and-antibiotics", "title": "Lorraine Day on Vaccines and Antibiotics", "description": "The information in this interview is designed to inform you rather", "image": "https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/6dbab62c-9f1b-4d3a-b198-894c5f17997e/24677_lorraine-day-on-vaccines-and-antibotics_16x9.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/6dbab62c-9f1b-4d3a-b198-894c5f17997e/24677_lorraine-day-on-vaccines-and-antibotics_16x9.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "576", "site_name": "Gaia"}, "tags": ["Watch On Demand"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
