McDonald agreeing with this analysis in his just published warning article \u201cThe Big Market Quake Is Coming\u201d, wherein he states: \u201cThe Fed is planet earth\u2019s central bank\u2026Every time they tried to play Tough Guy, they\u2019ve blown up the global economy\u201d.\n\nSees this warning coming within days of the Security Council exposing the COVID vaccine fraud being perpetrated upon the world by the United States\u2014which specifically sees the Americans pushing to the forefront the experimental live virus mRNA COVID vaccines containing untested nanoparticles, while at the same time they ignore the decades-long proven inactivated virus ones like Russia\u2019s Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID vaccines\u2014and whose insidious reason for doing so is because unlike the Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccines that protect against all COVID variants, the mRNA vaccines, like AstraZeneca and Moderna, offer no such protection\u2014which means everyone receiving mRNA vaccines will forever be having to receive booster shots as each new COVID variant emerges\u2014that in turn will allow these socialist-globalist monsters to keep this scamdemic ongoing long into the future so they can remake the world according to their diabolical \u201cThe Great Reset\u201d master plan.\n\nAfter boxing legend Marvelous Marvin Hagler was reported to have died after receiving an mRNA COVID vaccine this weekend, however, it was followed by Australia\u2019s Health Minister Greg Hunt being admitted to hospital in serious condition just one day after receiving a dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca\u2019s mRNA Covid vaccine\u2014thus making it no surprise that a few hours ago Germany, Italy, France and Spain joined the ranks of European and Asian countries that have temporarily halted use of AstraZeneca\u2019s mRNA COVID vaccine over blood-clot concerns\u2014further sees the European Medicines Agency (EMA) rushing to hold an emergency summit on these mRNA COVID vaccines and the World Health Organization (WHO) urgently discussing the halt of mRNA COVID vaccines\u2014all of which explains why in the just published article \u201cEU Greenlights Talks For Possible Sputnik Procurement After Dubbing Russia's Rollout \u2018Propaganda\u2019\u201d it says: \u201cReuters in a new report has admitted the \u201cunthinkable\u201d now looks very possible: despite Europe's fierce public criticism of Russia's coronavirus vaccine, it found that \u201cBehind the scenes, the bloc is turning to Moscow\u2019s Sputnik V shot as it tries to get its stuttering efforts to vaccinate its 450 million people back on track, EU diplomatic and official sources told Reuters\u201d.\n\nWhile this deadly COVID mRNA vaccine catastrophe continues unfolding, though, the socialist Democrats and their leftist mainstream propaganda media lapdogs won\u2019t allow the Americans to know what\u2019s going on\u2014and to keep these people distracted from true things sees them waging an all-out smear campaign against top Republican Party leader US Senator Ron Johnson, because during an interview this weekend he said about the 6 January protest at the US Capitol: \u201cNow, had the tables been turned\u2014Joe, this could get me in trouble\u2014had the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election, and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned\u201d.\n\nBy Senator Johnson openly telling the truth that no one at the US Capitol was really in fear of mainly elderly Trump supporters, his destruction of the lying narrative about this protest ignited a leftist media firestorm\u2014best exampled by the leftist Washington Post saying that Senator Johnson\u2019s \u201cracism is breathtaking\u201d, and leftist television talk show host Joy Behar screaming: \u201cYou know, he\u2019s right out there\u2026He\u2019s right out there with his racism\u2026There is no dog whistle for him\u2026He\u2019s scared of this fictitious idea of Antifa, a thing that doesn\u2019t even exist\u201d\u2014and in response to this unhinged rage-filled lying leftist media insanity, now sees Senator Johnson having released to the Wall Street Journal his open letter entitled \u201cI Won\u2019t Be Silenced By The Left\u201d, wherein he states: \u201cThey twisted what I said about Jan. 6 because they want Americans to forget last summer\u2019s violence and destruction\u201d\u2014then reveals: \u201cThose who seek political advantage by dividing the nation hurl the worst possible accusations to silence anyone who challenges their left-wing agenda\u201d\u2014and factually says:\n\nLeftists who want to memory hole last summer\u2019s political violence immediately started lecturing me that the 2020 protests were mostly peaceful.\n\nApparently they\u2019ve forgotten that, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, 570 leftist protests became riots last year.\n\nTwenty-five people lost their lives and 700 law enforcement officers were injured. Braying about \u201cpeaceful protests\u201d offers no comfort to those victims or the other innocent Americans whose homes, businesses and property were destroyed.\n\nThe same people fail to see the damage they do by pushing a narrative designed to portray the 74 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump as potential domestic terrorists or armed insurrectionists.\n\nWe should all be disgusted at the cynical way antifa and other leftists hide behind the banner of equality\u2014a goal we all share\u2014even as they carry signs calling for an end to America or talk of burning cities down. It was also sadly predictable that liberals would hurl the accusation of racism.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about race. It\u2019s about riots. The rioters who burned weren\u2019t of any one ethnicity; they were united by their radical leftism.\n\nTheir politics, together with their taste for violence\u2014so different from the Trump supporters I know personally or the Trump rallies we all saw carried out peacefully\u2014should concern us.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why the boarded-up windows in the downtowns of major cities came down soon after Joe Biden won the election: Nobody was worried what Trump supporters would do if their guy lost; they were worried about what Biden supporters would do if their guy didn\u2019t win.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the media have lost any sense of fairness and objectivity.\n\nThey shed all pretense of being unbiased the moment President Trump won the 2016 election. As a result, approximately half of simply doesn\u2019t trust the mainstream media or rely on what it reports.\n\nAn unbiased free press is essential in a democracy, but the censorship of conservative perspectives in today\u2019s cancel culture is antithetical to freedom.\n\nMost reporters today put advocacy above journalism. Instead of conducting interviews with conservatives, they conduct arguments.\n\nThey push their political viewpoints and are willing to lie, twist, distort, omit, censor and cancel anything or anyone with an opposing view. They are oblivious to the harm they are doing.\n\nAll who value liberty and free speech must push back.\n\n[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report, as an example of the full socialist brainwashing horror the American people are being subjected to, it\u2019s being best revealed today by the exposing of the 9 January leftist Washington Post \u201cbombshell\u201d article about what President Trump reportedly said on a phone call to the Georgia elections investigator, whose headline was \u201cFind The Fraud\u201d, and said Trump pressured a Georgia elections investigator in a separate call legal experts are saying could amount to obstruction\u2014a revelation so damning, it formed the basis of the impeachment charge leveled against President Trump by the socialist Democrats.\n\nUnknown to the greater masses of the American people about this leftist media claim, however, this report details, is that it was entirely fabricated out of thin air and never happened\u2014a fact exposed as being true this past week when the recording of this call was released proving President Trump said no such thing\u2014which is why a few days ago, on 11 March, the leftist Washington Post quietly retracted their made up lies, but about which is being said: \u201cA correction two months after the fact, when the story has already played a significant role in shaping perceptions of political events, seems wholly inadequate\u201d\u2014and in response to saw President Trump releasing a statement, in part, saying: \u201cWhile I appreciate the Washington Post's correction, which immediately makes the Georgia Witch Hunt a non- story, the original story was a Hoax, right from the very beginning\u2026You will notice that establishment media errors, omissions, mistakes, and outright lies always slant one way\u2014against me and against Republicans\u2026Meanwhile, stories that hurt Democrats or undermine their narratives are buried, ignored, or delayed until they can do the least harm\u201d.\n\nFully supporting these socialist Democrat and leftist media brainwashing lies, this report notes, are America\u2019s leftist tech giants\u2014one of the most prominent of whom is social media messaging giant Twitter, who this past week locked out top Republican Party icon former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich because he criticized Biden\u2019s immigration policies\u2014after which censorship-happy Twitter suddenly became concerned about \u201cpublic conversation\u201d as Russia cracks down on illegal content\u2014then saw Twitter rushing to a US Federal Court and filing a motion to dismiss a lawsuit from a minor who claims that they refused to remove child porn that featured him and another 13-year-old\u2014which is the exact reason Russia is taking legal actions against Twitter, because they refuse to abide by the law and remove tweets with information on ways of committing suicide, incitement to commit suicide, as well as child pornography and information about methods of making and using drugs\u2014and is why earlier today, Russian officials warned they are poised to announce a ban on the Twitter within weeks if they fail to comply with demands to take down these unlawful posts featuring child pornography, calls for suicide and drug use.\n\nWith the Ministry of Digital Development-Communications and Mass Media (Minkomsvyaz) having ordered that starting from 1 July, manufacturers of cell phone, tablets and computers will have to pre-install a domestic search engine in the browser by default, this report continues, this protection of the Russian people from American tech giants and leftist media brainwashing propaganda is needed because of \u201cThe Sovietization of the American Press\u201d, whose transformation from phony \u201cobjectivity\u201d to open one-party orthodoxy is rapidly expanding\u2014a Sovietization news expansion being noted in articles like \u201cFree Speech: And... It's Gone\u201d, that warns: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to me that the war against speech is accelerating\u2026There\u2019s desperation in the air everywhere\u201d\u2014and to the forces driving the Sovietization of the American press, sees them being revealed by Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, who in his just published article \u201cThe Leading Activists For Online Censorship Are Corporate Journalists\u201d states: \u201cIt should not require much work to recognize that vesting this magnitude of power in the hands of unaccountable billionaires, who operate outside the democratic process yet are highly influenced by public media-led pressure campaigns, is unsustainable\u201d.\n\nStill not being understood by the American people about their nation, this report further notes, is that it is no longer a democracy; rather it\u2019s an oligarchy\u2014which in English means the wealthy few move policy, while the average American has little power\u2014and to keep this power sees these wealthy corporate oligarchs needing to keep the American people divided against each other, otherwise they\u2019ll wise up to what\u2019s going on and turn on their masters\u2014which is why there is no affront against human morals or common sense too great to throw into the faces of these Americans\u2014best exampled this week by socialist California school districts using COVID money to pay teacher bonuses while keeping schools closed, and the Grammy Awards putting on an actual pornographic performance on live television.\n\nThe Grammy Awards is of particular notice, this report concludes, first of all because one of its presenters, comedian Bill Burr, openly attacked and mocked leftists\u2014an attack followed by leftists erupting in fury at Burr calling him a racist\u2014a leftist attack quickly met by Barr\u2019s wife Nia posting a picture of them together, who just happens to be a beautiful black woman\u2014which caused leftist mobs to then attack her saying such vile things like \u201cYou shouldn't assume someone isn't racist just because they own a minority sex servant\u2026They may very well have one because they're racist\u201d\u2014and secondly important notice about was followed by articles like \u201cWoke Grammy Awards Sees Ratings Plummet 50 Percent in Early Numbers Report\u201d and \u201cGet Woke, Go Broke: 2021 Grammy Ratings Tank, Could be Event\u2019s Lowest in History\u201d\u2014articles critical to notice because of the massive losses corporate television and entertainment giants are suffering because of leftist woke culture\u2014profit losses in the billions-of-dollars coming at the same articles are now appearing like \u201cCNN and MSNBC Built up That Trump Hate, Now They're Drowning Without Him\u201d\u2014and when all combined, shows how desperately these corporate oligarchs need President Trump to reemerge into the limelight\u2014an emergence of President Trump these corporate oligarchs will pave the way for by viciously turning on Biden and his socialist Democrats\u2014and is why astute political observers are predicting the soon coming demise of these socialist-leftist forces, like top President Ronald Reagan advisor Donald Devine, who states: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be absolutely clear to everybody in two \u2014 and certainly in the four years \u2014 that this whole progressive solution to the problem doesn\u2019t work...They tried this for almost a century now...I think what we\u2019re witnessing now is the end of an era...We\u2019re seeing the end of the progressive reforms started slowly under Woodrow Wilson, picking up on the Franklin Roosevelt, and peaking under Lyndon Johnson\u201d.\n\nMarch 16, 2021 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
