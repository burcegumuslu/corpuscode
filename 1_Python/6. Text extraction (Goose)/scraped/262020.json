But their desperate cries for help are never heard.\n\nInstead they are immediately dumped onto a conveyor belt, separated from their shells, and processed like auto parts in an assembly line.\n\nSick and weak chicks are thrown into dumpsters with the shells and brutally crushed.\n\n\u201cWhat awaits for those who survive is even worse,\u201d the film\u2019s narrator says.\n\nAfter being vaccinated, they\u2019re shot through chutes into crates, packed like sardines into trucks, and transported all across the country to fattening farms.\n\n\n\nIf a human baby grew at the same pace as these selectively bred baby chickens, it would weigh 600 pounds in two months.\n\nMany of them can\u2019t handle the pace at which their muscles grow. Their legs are crushed beneath their own weight and they become immobilized. They die in agony or are thrown away alive.\n\n\n\nAt just over a month old, they are sent to slaughter, where they are handled violently, breaking their legs and wings in the process.\n\nThe video ends by asking viewers to go vegan or eat less chicken. We\u2019d like to add the options of pasture-raised chicken and eggs, backyard chickens, grass-fed and wild meats, and/or producing fewer humans.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hidden Cameras at Chicken Hatchery Shed New Light on Horrors of Factory Farming", "description": "\u00a0 Undercover footage of baby chickens hatching on conveyor belts, stabbed with giant needles, thrown down chutes, or deemed too weak and crushed, goes viral.
