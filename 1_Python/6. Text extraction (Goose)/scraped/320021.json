That\u2019s an increase of 10,811 adverse events over the previous week.\n\nVAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe data included a total of 31,074 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 139 over the previous week \u2014 and 258,480 serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period \u2014 up 1,253 compared with the previous week.\n\nThere were a total of 563 reports of adverse events following the new bivalent booster COVID-19 vaccine as of Sept. 16, 2022. The data included a total of 5 deaths and 31 serious injuries.\n\nOf the 31,074 reported deaths, 19,934 cases are attributed to Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, 8,385 cases to Moderna, 2,704 cases to Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and no cases yet reported for Novavax.\n\nExcluding \u201cforeign reports\u201d to VAERS, 868,175 adverse events, including 14,531 deaths and 90,422 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and Sept. 16, 2022.\n\nForeign reports are reports foreign subsidiaries send to U.S. vaccine manufacturers. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product\u2019s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 14,531 deaths reported as of Sept. 16, 7% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination and 15% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination.\n\nIn the U.S., 600 million COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered as of Sept. 14, including 363 million doses of Pfizer, 231 million doses of Moderna and 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed.\n\nHistorically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nVAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Sept. 16, 2022, for 6-month-olds to 5-year-olds show:\n\u2022 3,843 adverse events, including 169 cases rated as serious and 6 reported deaths.\n\u2022 The CDC uses a narrowed case definition of \u201cmyocarditis,\u201d which excludes cases of cardiac arrest, ischemic strokes and deaths due to heart problems that occur before one has the chance to go to the emergency department.\n\nVAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Sept. 16, 2022, for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\u2022 14,115 adverse events, including 665 rated as serious and 28 reported deaths.\n\nVAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Sept. 16, 2022, for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 39,472 adverse events, including 4,277 rated as serious and 120 reported deaths.\n\u2022 According to the CDC, \u201cVAERS data available to the public include only the initial report data to VAERS. Updated data which contains data from medical records and corrections reported during follow up are used by the government for analysis. However, for numerous reasons including data consistency, these amended data are not available to the public.\u201d\n\u2022 269 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.\n\u2022 1,310 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis with 1,158 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 300 reports of blood clotting disorders with 277 cases attributed to Pfizer.\n\u2022 26 cases of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with all cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nVAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Sept. 16, 2022, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 16% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 53% of those who died were male, 42% were female and the remaining death reports did not include the gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 72.\n\u2022 As of Sept. 16, 8,471 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccines, including 4,898 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 16,353 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 73% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 22% to Moderna and 5% to J&J.\n\u2022 2,968 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, with 64% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 19% to Moderna and 17% to J&J.\n\u2022 10,015 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.\n\u2022 43,030 reports of blood-clotting disorders. Of those, 29,522 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 9,659 reports to Moderna and 3,789 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 23,926 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 18,186 cases attributed to Pfizer, 5,304 casesto Moderna and 410 cases to J&J.\n\u2022 67 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with 54 cases attributed to Pfizer, 12 cases to Moderna and 1 case to J&J.\n\u2022 534 cases of POTS with 395 cases attributed to Pfizer, 119 cases to Moderna and 21 cases to J&J.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.\n\nA Canadian woman on Sept. 14 died suddenly in a drug store within minutes of receiving the new bivalent COVID-19 booster shot, according to her daughter.\n\nCarol Pearce texted her daughter, Stephanie Foster, at 12:31 p.m. to say she received her booster shot and was waiting the recommended 15 minutes at the drug store. At 12:38 p.m., Pearce was unconscious.\n\nAn eyewitness told SASKTODAY.ca she was in the store when she heard screaming and crying. \u201cThey were saying in the store that it was about seven minutes,\u201d after Pearce got the booster shot that she collapsed on the floor, the witness said.\n\nA spokesperson from Saskatchewan Health told SASKTODAY.ca on Thursday Pearce died from natural causes.\n\n\u201cThe Saskatchewan coroner\u2019s service has investigated this instance and determined that the person died from natural causes,\u201d Dale Hunter, a communications consultant from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health said in an email.\n\n\u201cI do not believe this was caused from natural causes,\u201d Foster said. \u201cMy Mom had no health conditions. I believe had she not gotten that Covid shot then she would be here with us today!\u201d\n\nThe family said when Pearce left for her appointment, she was happy and healthy.\n\nThe CDC expects new bivalent COVID-19 boosters to be ready for kids ages 5 to 11 by mid-October, Reuters reported.\n\nThe agency said in a document released Tuesday it will issue a recommendation in early- to mid-October if the FDA authorizes the modified booster for this age group.\n\nThe CDC said it expects Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s bivalent booster to be available for children ages 5 to 11 and Moderna\u2019s bivalent booster to be available for children ages 6 to 17, pending authorization by the FDA.\n\nThe bivalent booster targets both the original Wuhan strain no longer in circulation and the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. The CDC expects pre-orders of the Pfizer booster to begin next week even though the FDA has not yet signed off on the vaccine for this age group.\n\nModerna\u2019s booster is the same formula used for children and adults and will not require a separate pre-order period, the agency said.\n\nA healthy 35-year-old woman who experienced a seizure two days after her second dose of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine was diagnosed with limbic encephalitis, a rare form of brain inflammation.\n\nThe authors of the report said the vaccine caused the woman\u2019s condition.\n\nAccording to the case report, when the woman arrived at the hospital she had a fever, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures that lasted for approximately five minutes and a postictal (post-seizure) phase of confusion that lasted approximately 30 minutes.\n\nWhile in the ER, she had two more generalized seizures and was stable. Upon admission to the hospital, a lumbar puncture was performed revealing significant lymphocytosis.\n\nShe then developed anisocoria, a condition in which the pupil of one eye differs in size from the pupil of the other eye. An urgent CT scan of the head showed possible temporal lobe hypodensities (darker areas on the CT scan). A head MRI showed features suggestive of limbic encephalitis. A subsequent electroencephalogram showed severe post-seizure encephalitic changes.\n\nWhile hospitalized, the patient developed abnormal behavior associated with limbic encephalitis and was diagnosed with autoimmune limbic encephalitis.\n\nResearchers concluded the patient\u2019s limbic encephalitis \u2014 which occurred quickly after COVID-19 vaccination \u2014 is an uncommon side effect of the vaccine based on the timing of symptoms and absence of other identifiable causes.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 7 will consider a New York Police Department detective\u2019s challenge to the city\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for municipal employees.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas granted the request by the detective, Anthony Marciano, after Justice Sonia Sotomayor initially rejected it. Marciano\u2019s challenge seeks to strike down the mandate for all city workers \u2014 including firefighters, police and teachers.\n\nAccording to data from the mayor\u2019s office, as of Aug. 30, 1,761 city workers have been fired for not getting the vaccine. That number is likely higher after the New York City Department of Education this month fired another 850 teachers and other staff, bringing the total to nearly 2,000 school employees fired for failure to comply with the mandate, according to the New York Post.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to consider Marciano\u2019s request came one day after New York Mayor Eric Adams rescinded the city\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private employers and student athletes \u2014 but not municipal employees.\n\nIn April 2021, Cathy Nagy\u2019s 84-year-old mother-in-law received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nAccording to Nagy, \u201cabout a week-and-a-half later, Marilyn experienced an episode of hallucinations, seeing people outside who were not there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarilyn\u2019s family attributed [the episode] to her dementia, even though she had not had any prior episodes \u2026 [They] did not make a connection to the vaccination.\u201d\n\nBut the family\u2019s opinion changed a few weeks later, after Marilyn got her second Pfizer shot and \u201chad a more dramatic reaction,\u201d experiencing \u201canother episode of hallucinations that same day, extreme weakness and pain in her leg,\u201d Nagy said.\n\nMarilyn seemed to recover, but over the coming weeks, she continued to experience occasional hallucinations, and an increased decline in her cognition, Nagy said, prompting a visit to a neurologist.\n\nAn MRI \u201crevealed she was experiencing blood clots, bleeding and mini-strokes in her brain, and she was sent directly to the ER for observation and treatment,\u201d Nagy said.\n\nAt the hospital, Marilyn was administered blood-thinning medications and appointments were scheduled \u201cwith several specialists.\u201d\n\nAbout a month later, she developed deep vein thrombosis in her left leg, which according to Nagy, was \u201cthe same leg that had been experiencing pain since her second vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer right leg also became painfully swollen, although no blood clot was found,\u201d Nagy said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s Sept. 18 statement that the COVID-19 pandemic is \u201cover\u201d prompted questions about why his administration hasn\u2019t ended the federal public health emergency and how the government or employers can continue to mandate Emergency Use Authorized vaccines.\n\nIn an interview aired Sunday on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d President Joe Biden declared the COVID-19 \u201cpandemic is over,\u201d in the first such statement by a prominent political figure in the U.S. Biden made the comment from the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, which was held for the first time since 2019.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden, using the auto show as a point of reference, stated:\n\n\u201cWe still have a problem with COVID. We\u2019re still doing a lotta work on it \u2026 but the pandemic is over.\n\n\u201cIf you notice, no one\u2019s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it\u2019s changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.\u201d\n\nSarah Lovenheim, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said the federal public health emergency \u201cremains in effect\u201d and that a 60-day notice would be provided by the agency before it is rescinded.\n\nThe earliest possible date when the emergency declaration would be lifted is in late November \u2014 well past the current Oct. 15 expiration date.\n\nHHS first declared the public health emergency on Jan. 31, 2020, and renewed it 10 times since, most recently on July 15. In order for COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized for emergency use, a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d must remain in effect.\n\nWoman with heart condition injured by Pfizer shot after being forced to choose between job and vaccine\n\nWhen her employer in 2021 mandated all employees get the COVID-19 vaccine, Heather Elkins, who had a pre-existing heart condition, requested a medical exemption.\n\nBut the Oregon Department of Human Services turned down her application \u2014 even though Elkins had transitioned, in 2020, to a permanent work-from-home employee.\n\nElkins, 45, told The Defender she was reluctant to get the vaccine in part because of the lack of long-term safety data but also because she saw reports of people developing heart issues.\n\nElkins got the Pfizer vaccine on Sept. 12, 2021, and \u201cwithin about an hour,\u201d she said, began experiencing adverse reactions.\n\nThe reactions she experienced after the first shot didn\u2019t qualify her for a medical exemption from the second shot, she said.\n\nSo despite continued efforts to secure a medical exemption, Elkins received her second Pfizer shot on Oct. 3, 2021, and experienced \u201cthe same severe reaction as with the first dose.\u201d\n\nA year later, Elkins continues to experience symptoms that affect her ability to work.\n\n\u201cTo date, I\u2019m experiencing all the same issues in addition to other symptoms like brain fog, horrible joint pain, pins and needles sensations, painful nerve zaps, shakiness and tremors in my hands and feet, and vision issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve now been mostly confined to my bed for the last 11 months, unable to do minimal activities because of my debilitating symptoms.\u201d", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Truth11.com", "type": "article", "title": "1.4 Million Adverse Events After COVID Vaccines Reported to VAERS, Canadian Woman Dies 7 Minutes After Bivalent Booster Shot", "description": "Global Research \u00a0/ \u00a0Megan Redshaw\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today released new data showing a total of 1,418,220 reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines were submitted between Dec. 14, 2020, and Sept. 16, 2022, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
