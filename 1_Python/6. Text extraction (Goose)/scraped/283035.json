The death of our beloved Lisa has left a terrible void in our family and in our lives.\n\n\u201cShe truly was the most wonderful wife, mum, daughter, sister and friend. We have said all we want to say in public at this time and ask to be left alone to grieve and rebuild our lives in private. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe coroner said: \u201cOn April 29th, 2021, she had a first doze of the AstraZeneca vaccine and, following that, she developed a vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia \u2013 a rare and aggressive complication associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was the underlying cause of her death.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Coroner Certifies: BBC Personality Died From AstraZeneca Vaccine", "description": "Where are the coroners, you ask?
