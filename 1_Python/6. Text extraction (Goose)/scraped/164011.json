As per UNILAD, companies can demand all their employees to get vaccinated. Although, there are serious concerns about whether people should be fired if they refuse to obey.\n\n\u201cHealth and safety laws say you have to protect other people at work, and when it becomes about protecting other people the argument gets stronger. If there is clear evidence that vaccines prevent transmission, the next stage is to make sure more and more people are taking up the vaccine.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all ministers are supportive of the idea.\n\nAs Daily Mail reports, some of them believe that forcing employees to vaccinate and threatening to fire them if they refuse \u201cwould be discriminatory.\u201d\n\nThough, it is thought that if the decision to obligate staff members to get the COVID-19 vaccine is taken to court, it will most likely be ruled in favor of the employers.\n\nFor instance, the company Pimlico Plumbers has already enforced a \u201cno jab, no job\u201d rule, as per The Guardian. Last month the firm\u2019s founder, Charlie Mullins, began outlining new employment agreements that include the vaccine requirement. In a statement, Mullins said that the COVID-19 vaccination is \u201cgoing to be standard\u201d in the new contracts. He explained:\n\n\u201cWhen we go off to Africa and Caribbean countries, we have to have a jab for malaria \u2014 we don\u2019t think about it, we just do it. So why would we accept something within our country that\u2019s going to kill us when we can have a vaccine to stop it?\u201d\n\nBut not everyone agrees the measures should be so drastic. Nick Wilcox, a BDBF partner, claims that bosses should maintain a balance between keeping their staff safe and avoiding breaking their trust. According to the law specialist, mandatory vaccinations may become an issue as not everyone will be willing to undergo the procedure due to different personal reasons.\n\nDo you think COVID-19 vaccines should be obligatory?
