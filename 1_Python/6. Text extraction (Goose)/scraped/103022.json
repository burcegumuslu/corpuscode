(Related: Remember back in 2012 when the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District sought federal and state approval to release GMO mosquitoes throughout Key West?)\n\nWill humans also be \u201cvaccinated\u201d by these new GMO mosquitoes?\n\nThe mosquitoes themselves are genetically modified (GMO) to contain the vaccines, which Aihau and his colleagues say in tests produced a strong, long-lasting immune response.\n\n\u201cOnce immunised, the animals resisted infections, thus helping to prevent the early spread of many viruses, including the once widespread Zika virus (ZIKV),\u201d the SCMP reported.\n\nAedes mosquitoes are the primary transmitters of Zika, which belongs to the flavivirus genus. People who become infected with it can develop symptoms ranging from rashes and fever to joint and muscle pain.\n\nIf a pregnant woman becomes infected with Zika while carrying, her infant can be born with microcephaly, which is an abnormally small head or cranial capacity, or some other congenital malformation. Zika infection can also lead to premature birth or miscarriage.\n\nZika is said to have been really bad in 2015, having reached a peak of around 1.3 million cases in Brazil that year before declining globally after 2017. Many tropical African and Asian countries are still plagued by it, though \u2013 at least that is what we are being told as an excuse for the creation of these new GMO mosquitoes.\n\nWhen it comes to GMO technologies, we are routinely told that tampering with the plant and animal kingdoms at the genetic level is necessary in order to stop disease. These new GMO mosquitoes are no exception, with the alleged threat of Zika necessitating the unleashing of genetically engineered, vaccine-delivering insects into the wild.\n\nZheng says the inspiration for his latest research comes from the 2009 discovery of the Chaoyang virus (CYV), which also belongs in the flavivirus genus, in Chaoyang City, located in China\u2019s Liaoning province. An earlier paper about that discovery claims that CYV is capable of replicating in mosquitoes but not in vertebrates, which include humans.\n\nFor Zheng\u2019s study, he and his team of researchers used CYV as a vaccine vector to develop a chimeric vaccine containing various proteins from a different virus. Several proteins from CYV were artificially inserted into ZIKV cells to create a CYV-ZIKV virus that is supposedly not infectious, but that replicates easily in mosquitoes and is released via their saliva.\n\nMosquitoes fed the CYV-ZIKV chimera virus were essentially transformed into vaccine carriers. And these carriers, once unleashed, have the ability to inject their targets \u2013 including humans \u2013 with what researchers say is a vaccine against the chimera virus with a simple bite.\n\nVaccines are dangerous and often deadly, regardless of whether they come out of medical syringes or wild insects.
