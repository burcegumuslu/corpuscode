Did you know that Wikipedia is anti-science and is actually edited by corporate-paid trolls on important topics such as GMOs, vaccines, chemotherapy and pharmaceuticals, and not by anonymous volunteer editors as claimed? If these didn\u2019t shock you, here\u2019re 10 startling facts that will shake your confidence in Wikipedia and its founder Jimmy Wales:\n\u2022 Wikipedia Was Started With Revenue From Soft-Core Porn\n\nWales launched a web search engine called Bomis in 1996. A big part of the site was the \u201cBomis Babe Report\u201d dedicated to half naked celebrities and women. The site also hosted nekkid.info, a place \u201cto see sexy naked women\u201d and \u201cThe Babe Engine\u201d an image search engine dedicated to finding pictures of attractive women.\n\nLarry Sanger, co-founder of Wikipedia, told the FBI that Wikimedia Commons (the parent company of Wiki products including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikinews and Wikiquote) is rife with renderings of children performing sexual acts. A 2010 Fox News investigation reportedly revealed the site \u201chas become home base for a loose worldwide network of pedophiles who are campaigning to spin the popular online encyclopedia in their favor and are trying to lure more people into their world.\u201d\n\nWales used the world\u2019s most popular online encyclopedia as a means of dumping his girlfriend \u2013 onetime Fox News pundit Rachel Marsden. Marsden responded by sending Valleywag an IM conversation that indicates Wales ordered changes to her Wikipedia biography in an effort to further his personal agenda. The email and sex chats seem to implicate Wales in an apparent conflict of interest involving top-down editing of Marsden\u2019s Wikipedia entry.\n\nIn purported retaliation, Rachel, a well-known conservative columnist, decided she could take the clothes he had left at her apartment and auction them off on eBay Canada.\n\nJeff Merkey, a former Novell chief scientist, accused Jimmy Wales of extortion. He stated that Wales agreed to place him under his \u201cspecial protection\u201d as an editor in exchange for a substantial donation and other financial support of the Wikimedia Foundation projects.\n\nDespite the steady wave of scandals that have begun to erode even the New York Times\u2019 portrayal of Hillary Clinton, her image remains unblemished on Wikipedia. Since he first started editing her page in June 2005, Hillary\u2019s \u201cWikipedia watchdog\u201d has been guarding against slanders, accusations, unfair assumptions, and distortions on the high-traffic, heavily footnoted, highly policed Hillary Rodham Clinton Wikipedia page.\n\nIn 2012, Roger Bamkin, trustee of the Wikimedia Foundation UK, and a Wikipedian In Residence were caught editing Wikipedia pages and facilitating front-page placement for their pay-for-play, publicity-seeking clients.\n\u2022 Wikipedia In The Midst Of An International Extortion Scandal\n\nRecently, the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that sponsors but does not operate Wikipedia, announced that it suspended 381 accounts for \u201cblack hat\u201d editing, in which editors charge and accept money for \u201cto promote external interests\u201d. The scam affected English Wikipedia, which boasts 4.9 million articles, has over 26 million users, and 1,343 administrators. Hundreds of small British businesses and minor celebrities were targeted by a high-level blackmail scam that was orchestrated by \u201crogue editors\u201d at Wikipedia.\n\nWikipedia deliberately allows corporate-funded Wikipedia editors to disparage authors, naturopaths, doctors and practitioners who help people heal.\n\nIf Natural News is to be believed, Jimmy Wales traded Wikipedia edits for sex by exploiting his editorial position over a female editor, ordered the intimidation and harassment of Wikipedia editors who attempted to maintain a truly \u201cneutral point of view\u201d about Jimmy Wales himself, and exploited his position within the Wikimedia Foundation to attempt to bury details about his own past.\n\nThis Article (10 Facts About Wikipedia Founder That Will Shock The Hell Out Of You) is free and open source.
