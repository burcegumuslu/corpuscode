Find the latest AMG-NEWS breaking news, videos, pictures and latest updates HERE: https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022\n\nBill Gates III October 28, 1955 is an American businessmen, philanthropist, investor, computer programmer, and inventor.In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft, which became the world\u2019s largest PC software company.\n\nDespite these many accomplishments why is there a clear and present video of this man formulating and funding ways to depopulate the earth with a majority of it\u2019s casualties being the poor community.\n\nThis video shows programs funded by Gates which include spermicides within vaccines, ultrasound equipment which is designed to destroy sperm cells permanently, GMO\u2019s in foods. Please watch and be informed:\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says:\n\n\u201cWorldwide efforts in the last two decades have reduced the number of polio cases by 99 percent. Until we reach eradication, however, we are working with governments and all partners in the polio effort to ensure no child is at risk of either contracting or transmitting this crippling disease.\u201d\n\nMonsanto used Bollywood actors and succeeded in selling India\u2019s farmers Bt cotton seeds. Profits for Monsanto rose.\n\nWhen yields were less than promised, farmers incurred massive debt, leading many to suicide, in what is considered \u201cthe worst-ever recorded wave of suicides of this kind in human history.\u201d To date, the number of suicides has surpassed 250,000.\n\n\u201cWith giant seed companies displacing cheap hybrids and far cheaper and hardier traditional varieties with their own products, a cotton farmer in Monsanto\u2019s net would be paying far more for seed than he or she ever dreamed they would. Local varieties and hybrids were squeezed out with enthusiastic state support.\n\n\u201cIn 1991, you could buy a kilogram of local seed for as little as Rs.7 or Rs.9 in today\u2019s worst affected region of Vidarbha. By 2003, you would pay Rs.350 \u2014 ($7) \u2014 for a bag with 450 grams of hybrid seed. By 2004, Monsanto\u2019s partners in India were marketing a bag of 450 grams of Bt cotton seed for between Rs.1,650 and Rs.1,800 ($33 to $36).\u201d\n\nLong after it was apparent that Monsanto was having a lethal impact on India, Bill Gates who says he wants to help the poor in India, made a huge investment in Monsanto.\n\nDoes Gates care that he invested in a company that has left poor children of India without their fathers and lost them their land they had lived on?\n\nHow is Gates\u2019 other investment \u2013 vaccines \u2013 faring? Mimicking Monsanto\u2019s PR, Gates used Bollywood actors to strongly promote his vaccine campaign to \u2018eradicate polio\u2019 across India.\n\nVaccines ware given to Indian children. Have they brought health? From \u201cPolio programmed: let us declare victory and move on\u201d by Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at Medical Ethics:\n\n\u201cIn 2011 there were an extra 47500 new cases of NPAFP [non-polio acute flaccid paralysis]. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Through this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated.\u201d\n\nThe Oral Polio Vaccines were given to Indian children. The CDC dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule in the US because it was causing polio.\n\n\u201cIn 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the \u2018principal if not sole cause\u2019 of all reported polio cases in the U.S. since 1961.\n\n\u201c(The virus remains in the throat for one to two weeks and in the feces for up to two months. Thus, vaccine recipients are at risk, and can potentially spread the disease, as long as fecal excretion of the virus continues .)\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 1992, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an admission that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the United States. In fact, according to CDC figures, every case of polio in the U.S. since 1979 was caused by the oral polio vaccine.\n\n\u201cAuthorities claim the vaccine was responsible for about eight cases of polio every year. However, an independent study that analyzed the government\u2019s own vaccine database during a recent period of less than five years uncovered 13,641 reports of adverse events following use of the oral polio vaccine.\n\n\u201cThese reports included 6,364 emergency room visits and 540 deaths. Public outrage at these tragedies became the impetus for removing the oral polio vaccine from immunization schedules.\u201d\n\nDid Gates not know the OPV had been dropped in the US as he suggested he wanted to bring the same good health to third world countries as Western countries enjoyed? If he did not know, is he pushing vaccines on the world\u2019s children without such basic and truly critical information?\n\nNeetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at St. Stephens Hospital in Delhi address the question of eradication:\n\n\u201cThe charade about polio eradication and the great savings it will bring has persisted to date. It is a paradox that while the director general of WHO, Margret Chan, and Bill Gates are trying to muster support for polio eradication it has been known to the scientific community, for over 10 years, that eradication of polio is impossible.\n\n\u201cThis is because in 2002 scientists had synthesized a chemical called poliovirus in a test-tube with the empirical formula C332,652H492,388N98,245O131,196P7, 501S2,340. It has been demonstrated that by positioning the atoms in sequence, a particle can emerge with all the properties required for its proliferation and survival in nature.\u201d [Emphasis added.]\n\n\u201cWimmer writes that the test-tube synthesis of poliovirus has wiped out any possibility of eradicating poliovirus in the future. Poliovirus cannot be declared extinct because the sequence of its genome is known and modern biotechnology allows it to be resurrected at any time in vitro.\n\n\u201cMan can thus never let down his guard against poliovirus. Indeed the 18-year-old global eradication campaign for polioviruses will have to be continued in some format forever.\n\n\u201cThe long promised \u2018infinite\u2019 monetary benefits from ceasing to vaccinate against poliovirus will never be achieved . The attraction that \u2018eradication\u2019 has for policy makers will vanish once this truth is widely known.\u201d\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is apparently out of touch with what the scientific community has known for 10 years, as its website\u2019s page on polio indicates.\u201d\n\nViral Content: This Secret Ancient Japanese Tonic Recipe Will Help You Melts 54 LBS Of Fat\n\nAid for the poorest has already achieved a lot. For example, because of donors\u2019 generosity, we are on the threshold of ending polio once and for all.\n\nAnd then the Foundation continues about how terrible polio is and how many children it paralyzed and killed.\n\nPolio is a terrible disease that kills many and paralyzes others. Fifty years ago it was widespread around the world. When you talk to people who remember polio in the United States, they\u2019ll tell you about the fear and panic during an outbreak and describe grim hospital wards full of children in iron lungs that maintained their breathing.\n\nAt its peak in the United States in 1952, polio paralyzed or killed more than 24,000 people.\n\nBut in 2011 alone, the Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019 polio vaccine campaign in India caused 47,500 cases of paralysis and death.\n\n\u201cIt has been reported in the Lancet that the incidence of AFP, especially non-polio AFP has increased exponentially in India after a high potency polio vaccine was introduced (25).\n\n\u201cGrassly and colleagues suggested, at that time, that the increase in AFP was the result of a deliberate effort to intensify surveillance and reporting in India (26). The National Polio Surveillance Programme maintained that the increased numbers were due to reporting of mild weakness, presumably weakness of little consequence (27).\n\n\u201cHowever in 2005, a fifth of the cases of non-polio AFP in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) were followed up after 60 days. 35.2% were found to have residual paralysis and 8.5% had died (making the total of residual paralysis or death \u2013 43.7%) (28).\n\n\u201cSathyamala examined data from the following year and showed that children who were identified with non-polio AFP were at more than twice the risk of dying than those with wild polio infection (27).\n\n\u201cData from India on polio control over 10 years, available from the National Polio Surveillance Project, has now been compiled and made available online for it to be scrutinised by epidemiologists and statisticians (29). This shows that the non-polio AFP rate increases in proportion to the number of polio vaccines doses received in each area.\n\n\u201cNationally, the non-polio AFP rate is now 12 times higher than expected. In the states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar, which have pulse polio rounds nearly every month, the non-polio AFP rate is 25- and 35-fold higher than the international norms.\n\n\u201cThe relationship of the non-polio AFP rate is curvilinear with a more steep increase beyond six doses of OPV in one year. The non-polio AFP rate during the year best correlates to the cumulative doses received in the previous three years. Association (R2) of the non-polio AFP rate with OPV doses received in 2009 was 41.9%.\n\n\u201cAdding up doses received from 2007 increased the association (R2 = 55.6% p < 0.001) (30). Population density did not show any association with the non-polio AFP rate, although others have suggested that it is related to polio AFP (31).\n\n\u201cThe international incidence of non-polio AFP is said to be 1 to 2/100,000 in the populations under 15 (32, 33). The benchmark of good surveillance is the ability to detect one case of AFP per 100,000 children even in the absence of polio (34).\n\n\u201cIn 2011, an additional 47,500 children were newly paralysed in the year, over and above the standard 2/100,000 non-polio AFP that is generally accepted as the norm. (32-33). [Emphasis added]\n\n\u201cIt is sad that, even after meticulous surveillance, this large excess in the incidence of paralysis was not investigated as a possible signal, nor was any effort made to try and study the mechanism for this spurt in non-polio AFP. [Emphasis added]\n\n\u201cThese findings point to the need for a critical appraisal to find the factors contributing to the increase in non-polio AFP with increase in OPV doses \u2013 perhaps looking at the influence of strain shifts of entero-pathogens induced by the vaccine given practically once every month.\n\n\u201cFrom India\u2019s perspective the exercise has been extremely costly both in terms of human suffering and in monetary terms. It is tempting to speculate what could have been achieved if the $2.5 billion spent on attempting to eradicate polio were spent on water and sanitation and routine immunization.\u201d\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is apparently out of touch with what is known about the impossibility of eradicating polio, but it is not out of touch with the money involved.\n\n\u201c\u2026. the last 1 percent remains a true danger. Eradication is not guaranteed. It requires campaigns to give polio vaccine to all children under 5 in poor countries, at a cost of almost $1 billion per year. We have to be aggressive about continuing these campaigns until we succeed in eradicating that last 1 percent.\n\n\u201cTherefore, funding is critical to success. Organizations such as Rotary International http://www.rotary.org and the governments of India, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are all major contributors to the polio campaign. Our foundation gives about $200 million each year. But the campaign still faces a 2011-12 funding gap of $720 million.\n\n\u201cIf eradication fails because of a lack of generosity on the part of donor countries it would be tragic. We are so close, but we have to finish the last leg of the journey. We need to bring the cases down to zero, maintain careful surveillance to ensure the virus is truly gone, and keep defenses up with polio vaccines until we\u2019ve confirmed success.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s page on polio begins with urging eradication which is known to not be possible, but it ends with wanting money.\n\n\u25ba Educate-Yourself: Why You Should Put Garlic in Your Ear Before Going to Sleep. Watch video:\n\nLike Monsanto\u2019s Bt seeds which were an agricultural and financial disaster for India\u2019s farmers, Gate\u2019s polio vaccine campaign has been the same \u2013 a public health and financial disaster for India.\n\nWe have seen how polio, that was not a priority for public health in India, was made the target for attempted eradication with a token donation of $ 0.02 billion. The Government of India finally had to fund this hugely expensive programme, which cost the country 100 times more than the value of the initial grant.\n\nDid Monsanto stop their sale of Bt cotton seeds after it became apparent that farmers were being destroyed by overwhelming debt, the poor yields of the seeds and their inability to save seeds?\n\nHas anyone from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation rushed to India to suspend their polio vaccines until crucial questions can be answered about their causingNPAFP [non-polio acute flaccid paralysis] and deaths?\n\nIs the Foundation addressing the lack of vaccine safety? Vaccine safety may be a sensitive subject as Mr. Gates is on record in saying that \u201cpeople who engage in anti-vaccine efforts [those questioning the safety of vaccines] kill children.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Mr. Gates\u2019 polio campaign has been documented to have paralyzed 47,5000 children.\n\nPuliyel says that \u201cchildren who were identified with non-polio AFP were at more than twice the risk of dying than those with wild polio infection (27).\u201d\n\nBill Gates gives no figures or any details to back up his claim that people skeptical of vaccines are killing children, but he referred to parents didn\u2019t give their children the pertussis vaccine and measles vaccines and children dying.\n\nHowever, Mr. Gates may not be aware that teens in Canada vaccinated for measles have come down with measles in greater numbers than the unvaccinated and vaccinated children who are developing pertussis (whooping cough).\n\nMust-Read: GITMO Update: Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp Arrests, Indictments and Executions for Thousands of New Ex-Elite Prisoners \u2013 Official Documents\n\nFor pertussis cases in which vaccination histories are known, between 44 and 83 percent were of people who had been immunized, according to data from nine California counties with high infection rates. In San Diego County, more than two thirds of the people in this group were up to date on their immunizations.\n\n\u00b7 Health officials in Ohio and Texas, two states experiencing whooping cough outbreaks, report that of all cases, 75 and 67.5 percent respectively, reported having received a pertussis vaccination.\n\n\u00b7 Today, the rate of disease in some California counties is as high as 139 per 100,000, rivaling rates before vaccines were developed.\n\n\u00b7 Public officials around the world rely heavily on two groups of pertussis experts when setting vaccine policy relating to the disease. Both groups, and many of their members,receive money from the two leading manufacturers of pertussis vaccine.\n\n\u00b7 Dr. Fritz Mooi, a well-known Dutch scientist who has been studying mutations of the pertussis bacteria for 15 years, said a more virulent strain of bacteria is contributing to outbreaks.\n\nThe polio vaccine uses a synthetic virus which has created a more virulent strain. Does the pertussis vaccine also use a synthetic virus?\n\nThe WHO, which is working with Mr. Gates through GAVI, classifies the paralysis occurring in India as non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP).\n\nPerhaps Bill Gates might consider that while Monsanto\u2019s Bollywood PR worked to sell Bt seeds and Gates\u2019 Bollywood PR worked to push his polio vaccines, no Monsanto PR changes the reality of the farmers\u2019 suicides.\n\nAnd \u2018relabeling\u2019 paralysis after the vaccines were given does not change the facts. Paralysis is paralysis to the child who can no longer walk. Death is death to the parents who have lost a child.\n\nMr. Gates intends to vaccinate every child in the world. He has not been slowed in that commitment despite the mass numbers of death and paralysis of children in India.\n\nNot pausing from and not even investigating the disaster he has already caused, how many more children will Mr. Gates \u201chelp\u201d?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How to Kill 15% of Population \"by Bill Gates\" (video) - American Media Group", "description": "This video shows programs funded by Gates which include spermicides within vaccines,ultrasound equipment which is designed to destroy sperm cells permanently, GMO\u2019s in foods.
