Those who become injured or die after voluntarily getting jabbed will not be covered.\n\nThere is an entire claims process within the FECA literature that injured employees who took the jabs under duress must follow if they hope to be reimbursed, as well as receive continuation of pay if they are no longer able to work.\n\n\u201cWhen a claim is received for injury due to receipt of the COVID-19 vaccination, the claims examiner should determine if the vaccine was received prior to September 9, 2021,\u201d the document states.\n\n\u201cIf the vaccination was received prior to this date, coverage is afforded only if the vaccine was administered or sponsored by the employing agency.\u201d\n\nBack in December, CNBC made it clear that the general public cannot sue Pfizer or Moderna if they develop \u201csevere covid vaccine side effects.\u201d That same fake news network added that \u201cthe government likely won\u2019t compensate you for damages either.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s recognition that serious side effects could lead to damages that need to be compensated because of the federal vaccine mandate but denial of civil litigation as a recourse for civilians illustrates just another two-tier system of justice in Biden\u2019s America,\u201d Becker News concluded.\n\nThe latest news about Chinese Virus injection tyranny can be found at Fascism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden sneaks caveat into covid vaccine mandate order authorizing damages for vaccine injuries", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2021-10-20-biden-covid-vaccine-mandate-authorizing-damages-injuries.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "The Biden regime has quietly inserted special language into its federal Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d mandate that openly acknowledges the jabs can cause serious adverse effects.
