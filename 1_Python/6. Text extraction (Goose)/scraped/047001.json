Led by Peter Daszak, EHA\u2019s research alongside the Wuhan Institute of Virology gave rise to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gain-of-function research genetically alters an organism in a way that may enhance the biological functions of gene products.\n\nRenowned writer Alex Berenson posted on Twitter: \u201cThis must be a joke. Please tell me this is a joke. @nih just gave @EcoHealthNYC and Peter Daszak a NEW grant for bat coronavirus research? Including supplying viral sequences and isolates for use in vaccine development? Nope. Not a joke. The joke, apparently, is on us.\u201d\n\nBerenson further cited the actual grant published on the NIH website.\n\nShroyer referred to Dr. Francis Boyle\u2019s recent guesting on the \u201cAlex Jones Show\u201d in connection with this news. Boyle, an international law professor, exposed President Joe Biden and his tyrannical administration when he issued an executive order, which violates the biological weapon guardrail legislation that he drafted in 1989 by green-lighting the development of an \u201coffensive biological warfare weapon\u201d and a vaccine for it.\n\n\u201cThey admit that they will be engaging in the development of offensive biological warfare weapons involving potentially pandemic pathogens like COVID-19 was,\u201d Boyle said.\n\nShroyer said fortune favors the bold. \u201cThey\u2019re bold and going for full eugenics, full population control on this planet.\u201d (Related: Keep the Republic: EcoHealth whistleblower has evidence to prove coronavirus was created in Wuhan lab, says Thomas Renz \u2013 Brighteon.TV.)\n\nEHA gets award despite previously failing to turn over essential records required in COVID probe\n\nThe $653,392 grant titled \u201cAnalyzing the potential for future bat coronavirus emergence in Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam\u201d was awarded on September 21. It went through despite an open congressional investigation into EHA, which has two other ongoing NIH grants and a third in negotiation. EHA has already lost a previous sub-award because they refused to turn over essential records required in an investigation of the COVID-19 origins.\n\n\u201cNIH has requested on two occasions that EHA provide NIH the laboratory notebooks and original electronic files from the research conducted at WIV. To date, WIV has not provided these records,\u201d the NIH wrote to the committee back in August. \u201cToday, NIH has informed EHA that since WIV is unable to fulfill its duties for the sub-award under grant R01AI110964, the WIV sub-award is terminated for failure to meet award terms and conditions requiring the provision of records to NIH upon request.\u201d\n\nRichard Ebright, a molecular biologist with the Waksman Institute at Rutgers University, is bothered that additional funding continues to be awarded for the same high-risk research \u201cthat may have caused the current pandemic before there has been a national investigation of the origin of the current pandemic.\u201d\n\nVisit Pandemic.news for more news related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWatch the full segment of \u201cThe War Room\u201d with Owen Shroyer below.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nGain of function researcher Peter Daszak accused of being CIA asset; EcoHealth Alliance described as \u201cfront\u201d for agency.", "opengraph": {"title": "Owen Shroyer slams NIH, Fauci for granting EcoHealth Alliance funds for another round of coronavirus research", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-10-11-nih-fauci-granting-funds-another-coronavirus-research.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "Owen Shroyer denounced the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u00a0(NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci for awarding a new grant to EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) for more bat coronavirus research. \u201cThe criminals who made us sick with laboratory-made [Wuhan coronavirus] COVID-19 were never arrested, so they\u2019re back at it,\u201d Shroyer\u00a0said during [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.biggovernment.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2022/10/Fauci-Senate-Help-Committee.jpg"}, "tags": ["research", "science deception", "gain-of-function", "science fraud", "covid-19", "EcoHealth Alliance", "big government", "biowar", "biological warfare", "Fauci", "InfoWars", "Peter Daszak", "bat coronavirus", "conspiracy", "bioterrorism", "Owen Shroyer", "biological weapon", "corruption", "pandemic", "NIH"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.brighteon.com/03bfbfd8-de09-4235-96cc-c8456d68b324", "http://english.whiov.cas.cn/", "https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1576377456772218882", "https://reporter.nih.gov/search/0jAp779zVkaN-DEsKnKa5A/project-details/10522470", "https://www.infowars.com/posts/un-treaty-creates-medical-dictatorship-under-biden/", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-09-26-ecohealth-whistleblower-covid-created-in-wuhan-lab.html", "https://theintercept.com/2022/10/04/ecohealth-alliance-lab-leak-nih-grant/", "https://www.rutgers.edu/", "https://pandemic.news/", "https://www.brighteon.com/03bfbfd8-de09-4235-96cc-c8456d68b324", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/infowarsnetwork", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-25-nih-funded-gain-of-function-research-coronaviruses.html", "https://globalism.news/2022-03-23-ukraine-biolabs-operator-metabiota-ecohealth-wef-epstein.html", "https://corruption.news/2021-10-25-nih-confesses-funding-gain-function-coronavirus-research.html", "https://deception.news/2022-01-25-peter-daszak-said-to-be-cia-asset-ecohealth-alliance-is-a-front.html", "https://www.brighteon.com/03bfbfd8-de09-4235-96cc-c8456d68b324", "https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1576377456772218882", "https://reporter.nih.gov/search/0jAp779zVkaN-DEsKnKa5A/project-details/10522470", "https://www.infowars.com/posts/un-treaty-creates-medical-dictatorship-under-biden/", "https://theintercept.com/2022/10/04/ecohealth-alliance-lab-leak-nih-grant/", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fbiggovernment%2F2022-10-11-nih-fauci-granting-funds-another-coronavirus-research.html&linkname=Owen%20Shroyer%20slams%20NIH%2C%20Fauci%20for%20granting%20EcoHealth%20Alliance%20funds%20for%20another%20round%20of%20coronavirus%20research", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
