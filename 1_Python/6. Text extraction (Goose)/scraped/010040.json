If something becomes a baby, when not interfered with, then it holds the potential to be human. Once it acquires potential, then it is only a matter of time it becomes an autonomous human, thereby entitled to all rights that comes along with it. So harming the potential amounts to murder. Well there is no denying that anything that has a heartbeat doesn't hold life on it's own. It's foolish to equate something that has a heartbeat as not being human. Once you have a heartbeat it is only a matter of *location* and some time till you are a completely autonomous human entitled to all rights. Clearly if you see something that has a heartbeat, you clearly know it's life. Life stops when your heartbeat stops. We can be clear that *location* of an entity dosen't imply whether it has life or not. So if it has heartbeat, it has life. Hence harming that life, amounts to murder\n\nI know the potentiality argument, because thats what pro-life people choose because they can't defend their morality any other way.\n\nIf you want to defend the \"potentiality\" argument you are going to have a really hard time doing it. Why don't we call having a blowjob or handjob or having sex with a condom on as murder? Because sperm has the potentiality to become a human, so why not consider it murder? So you can't really escape the 'line argument'.\n\naccounts to murder but not necessarily human murder, thats the point. Most people don't give a damn about killing life around them. For instance you can kill insects thats a life form and no one gives a damn about it, or i could name a million different kind of life-forms that you can kill without any laws protecting them.\n\nSo lets get deeper into it. Anything that has a heart accounts as murder? Should we have laws that protects every living creature that has a heart? See its going to be really complicated to defend the 'potentiality' points.\n\nSo if you want to defend your point we can go deeper into it.\n\nYeah it can be interpreted as harm for them, but what i am talking about is not up for interpretation it is objectively harmful for humans. And one really fundamental distinction between these two, that one is infectious the other one is not. What i am talking about can be tangibly measured.\n\nAlso when it comes to these kind of debates we can weight which harm is worse than the other one. Because they don't hold the same weight.\n\nIf you want to defend this point this is going to be another hard one. Because if you want a society where you don't want to infring on anyone just because what if they will get angry or what if they will interpret it as harm, then this argument could be made to defend any immoral points.\n\nWe can strectch your infrigement argument very very far, and thats the problem. For example if i wanted to use your argument, then we shouldn't infringe upon pedohiles by protecting children with laws, because it might upset the pedo-s or they might interpret it as harmful. The same could be made for psychopaths and people who actually want to murder people who are already born.\n\nOr if you say thats not relevant, because those two example are not directly 100% related to the \"my body my choice\" argument, then regarding to how to weight if my or your argument make more sense, we can weight the harm.\n\nRegarding to the 'my body my choice' one, some consequences are:\n\u2022 Spreading the virus faster, so killing some people\n\u2022 because more people catch the virus, there are more people who can't go to work, so they can't earn money, the companies are losing more workers so it has measurable damage on the incomes on both sides\n\nAnd we can compare it to mine, where we basically have angry people, who don't want to get infringed upon, and a very small number of people with some side effects\n\nSo far it seems more damage on society if we want to use your argument and morality.\n\nDepending on your morality, and depends on in what stage we are talking about abortion.\n\nI don't really want to make this thread to a covid19 debate, because we already have a few of them and most of my arguments are made there regarding this vaccine topic.\n\nYou can advice people \"to just stay home\" and it can help, but people must work and you can't just shot down companies forever. I don't think i need to justify why it would be horrible if everything would be shut down for a few month just because you want people totally isolated.\n\nAlso i could argue, that forceing people to stay home for x amount of time would be a bigger violation on ther autonomy.\n\nIf we are talking about not total isolation, then we are still talking about spreading, and people who are working can bring back the virus. So this talking point is not above my argument \"which violates bodily autonomy\" according to you.\n\nSo the diesase still would have been spread really fast, and those who refused to take the vaccine made the spreading faster, infected more people so we are going back to the hospital argument, that because of these \"my body my choice\" people, people flooded hospitals even more.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Bodily Autonomy: Abortions & Vaccines", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/80789-bodily-autonomy-abortions-vaccines/", "description": "\n\n\tTwo Genuine Questions:\n\n\n\n\t1) If pregnant lady being killed amounts to double homicide, then why is abortion not considered as murder?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe mother, vi...", "updated_time": "2022-06-20T12:58:59Z", "site_name": "Actualized.org Forum", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["1", "4", "Prev", "Next", "3", "Posted May 5, 2022", "2"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "May 5, 2022"}
