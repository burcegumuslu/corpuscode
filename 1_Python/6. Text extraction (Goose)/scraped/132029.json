Since that time, numerous other WHO member states have proposed their own amendments as well, bringing the total number of amendments up to 307.\n\nOne of these amendments grants the WHO new powers to declare \u201cpotential\u201d health emergencies. Another orders all member states to recognize the WHO as the \u201ccoordinating authority\u201d in the event of certain health emergencies.\n\n\u201cThey also outline how the WHO intends to use its new powers to push global vaccine passports when it declares \u2018potential or actual\u2019 health emergencies,\u201d reported Reclaim the Net. (Related: In 2021, California legislators were pushing a bill to impose vaccine passports on state residents.)\n\nThe WHO isn\u2019t going to stop until every last person is microchipped and tracked like cattle\n\nThe current version of the IHR already allows the WHO to issue recommendations to \u201creview proof of vaccination,\u201d \u201crequire vaccination,\u201d and \u201cimplement tracing of contacts of suspect or affected persons.\u201d The amendments expand that by granting even more power to the WHO to control world affairs during a \u201chealth emergency.\u201d\n\nNew text was added to the IHR allowing member states to force the procuration of \u201cdocuments containing information for a lab test in digital or physical format\u201d as well as \u201cinformation on vaccination against a disease.\u201d\n\nAnother amendment specifies that \u201cdocuments containing information concerning traveller\u2019s destination \u2026 should preferably be produced in digital form, with paper form as a residual option.\u201d\n\nThis couples with yet another amendment that paves the way for \u201cother types of proofs and certificates\u201d as \u201cmay be designed by the Health Assembly,\u201d this referring to the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, which \u201cattest the holder\u2019s status as having a decreased risk of being the disease carrier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese other proofs include test certificates (which provide proof someone has been tested for a disease) and recovery certificates (which provide proof someone has recovered from a disease),\u201d this particular amendment further states.\n\nOne of the most concerning aspects of these changes is that they stipulate that \u201cvaccination certificates should be considered approved\u201d the moment the WHO declares a public health emergency, imagined or otherwise. They also mandate that these vaccination certificates \u201cincorporate means to verify their authenticity via retrieval from an official web site, such as a QR code.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt minimum, the WHO wants vaccine, test, and recovery certificates to contain a person\u2019s name, national identity number, passport number, type of vaccine, vaccine batch number, date of administration, place of administration, and an official stamp,\u201d Reclaim the Net warns.\n\n\u201cIn the maximum scenario, the WHO wants these digital certificates to contain all of the data from the minimum scenario plus a person\u2019s vaccination history and a QR code that supports the retrieval of vaccination information.\u201d\n\nThe WHO is a ringleader in global medical fascism.
