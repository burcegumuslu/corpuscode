Ayurveda\u2019s fundamentals are based on a direct experience of life in sync with nature\u2019s rhythms.\n\nToday, at LifeSpa.com, I write about Ayurveda\u2019s ancient wisdom and the evolving Western science that backs it up. My hope is that this podcast becomes somewhat of a circadian guide to help families stay in rhythm throughout each phase of life.\n\nFor your family and yourself, don\u2019t miss this podcast! I\u2019ll take you through the innate wisdom of childhood, teenage years, and adulthood, so you can live each cycle to its fullest potential.\n\nA growing number of studies are being published on the health and longevity benefits of resetting your circadian clock.\n\nAccording to one study, \u201cResetting the circadian clock leads to well-being and increased life span, whereas clock disruption is associated with aging and sickness. Increased longevity and improved health can be achieved by different feeding regimens that reset circadian rhythms and may lead to better synchrony in metabolism and physiology.\u201d (1)\n\nBasically, this is saying that lifestyle changes are directly linked to longer life and better health.\n\nMuch of this excitement is due to the 2017 Nobel Prize-winning research on Circadian Medicine and the discovery that the trillions of bacteria that make up our microbiome actually live in sync with the light/dark 24-hour circadian cycles.\n\nThe 24-hour circadian rhythms regulate behavior, metabolism, and the physiological functions in single-celled organisms, mammals, and humans.\n\nStaying in rhythm with the circadian clocks that are found in each and every cell of the body is critical for our lifelong health and well-being. (2)\n\nCircadian disruption\u2014which is when we fall out of circadian (light/dark) cycle rhythm\u2014has been linked to a host of health concerns including cardiovascular, digestive, nervous system, urinary tract and metabolic concerns related to weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol regulation.\n\nIn shift workers, who endure regular circadian disruption, these health concerns are more prevalent, suggesting the importance of a lifestyle in rhythm with the natural cycles for all of us.\n\nSee also Circadian Rhythms 101: Nobel Prize-Winning Research Validates the Ayurvedic Circadian Clock\n\nAccording to Ayurveda, the circadian clock is broken down into three life phases that science is only just beginning to understand.\n\nTo reset our circadian clocks, we much return to a lifestyle and diet that is in sync with the natural 24-hour, light/dark circadian cycles.\n\nOur biological clocks function uniquely based on the age of the individual.\n\nChildren have clocks to support growth and development and learning.\n\nTeenagers are reckless and hormonal to ensure the sexual reproduction of the species.\n\nMiddle-aged biological clocks drive adrenal-based survival chemicals to make sure the family is safe, protected, and sheltered.\n\nMenopause, for men and women, triggers a whole new set of biological clocks that set into motion accelerated aging, to make sure that an elder is not consuming resources that a younger, more fertile, reproductively active young adult or their children may need.\n\nBasically, nature has a way of getting rid of us as we age, once again, to protect the survival of the species.\n\nIn Ayurveda, these life cycles are broken down into three phases:\n\u2022 The kapha phase of life, from birth to adolescence, where the biological clocks are driving growth and development.\n\u2022 The pitta phase of life, from puberty to menopause.\n\u2022 Then, the vata time of life\u2014where the wisdom of a lifetime is passed onto the children\u2014can begin in the late 50\u2019s or early 60\u2019s, and carries you to your death.\n\nFor each of these life phases, there are specific lifestyle and dietary adjustments that should be made to encourage rhythm with your circadian and biological clocks.\n\nUnderstanding how to help you and your family live a lifestyle in sync with these rhythms is paramount to your health and longevity. (1,2)\n\nTo help folks live this type of lifestyle and reset your circadian clocks, I wrote an eBook, Ayurveda for a Healthy Family. This FREE eBook takes you through Ayurvedic circadian-resetting activities during every aspect of your family\u2019s life and needs.\n\nIt includes a 1-hour audio course where I dive deep into family health, Ayurveda-style. Organized into 8 individual tracks, this audio course is an invaluable resource for those looking for guidance in keeping their family healthy and happy.\n\nIn the eBook, I touch on topics including:\n\u2022 And much, much more\u2026\n\nThis topic of how to reset your circadian clocks at different times of your life is so important that I am dedicating tonight\u2019s entire podcast to it!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Podcast Episode 077: Ayurveda for a Healthy Family", "description": "In this month's podcast, Dr. John discusses family health from an Ayurvedic point of view.", "url": "https://lifespa.com/podcast/episode-077-ayurveda-healthy-family/", "site_name": "John Douillard's LifeSpa", "article:published_time": "2018-08-13T18:55:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-26T22:04:53+00:00", "image": "https://lifespa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jessica-rockowitz-5NLCaz2wJXE-unsplash-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1971", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["video"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://youtu.be/ayMoS3wITZ8", "https://youtu.be/ayMoS3wITZ8", "/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ayurveda-For-A-Healthy-Family.mp3", "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lifespa-teleseminars/Ayurveda-For-A-Healthy-Family.mp3", "#Ayurveda_for_Family_Health", "#Ayurveda_and_Circadian_Science", "https://lifespa.com/nobel-prize-validates-ayurvedic-circadian-clock/", "https://lifespa.com/nobel-prize-validates-ayurvedic-circadian-clock/", "https://lifespa.com/about-lifespa/ayurveda/what-is-ayurveda/", "https://store.lifespa.com/product/ayurveda-for-a-healthy-family-ebook/"], "authors": ["Dr. John Douillard, DC, CAP"], "publish_date": "2018-08-13T18:55:00+00:00"}
