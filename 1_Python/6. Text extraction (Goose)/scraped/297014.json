I love to dig deeper ... and that is what led me to become an educator, and later a health writer, with hundreds of my articles published in major magazines over the past 20 years.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve always had a strong sense of justice. I know the difference between right and wrong and it infuriates me to no end when I see injustices occurring. That is why I've always had a keen interest in politics and current events, and I got my BA in Political Science, and an MA in International Policy Studies, so I've spent many years in the international arena.\n\nHaving lived and traveled abroad extensively, I gained a broad perspective on life, on the different cultures, on different values and world views.\n\nMost of my professional career prior to wellness was at the university level, working in international education.\n\nI was the Director of Teacher Education at the University of California, Irvine, where I was in charge of professional development for K-12 teachers and also ran the teacher training programs for teaching English as a Second Language.\n\nIn my education career, I've had the opportunity to teach and reach thousands of international students and administrators from countries around the world. Again with these experiences and exposures have contributed to my expanded worldview, and have taught me the value to consider other perspectives rather than clinging to my own tightly-held beliefs.\n\nI also served as the national wellness expert for the ABC Radio Network for seven years with more than 500 radio appearances.\n\nMy career in television included several years as the wellness expert for the Emmy-nominated show, America Now, with over a hundred television appearances.\n\nI've run four of my own businesses, including THE HEALTHY AMERICAN, which provides education and information to inspire others to take action to defend truth and freedom.\n\nHaving worked in television for several years on a news-related daily show, I remember clearly being told by my producer that we need to \"scare the viewers\" first, before giving them the solution.\n\nIronically, ever since the age of about 15, I stopped watching television, and never had cable. I don't care for TV shows, i don't have Netflix, and I don't watch any news programs. I'm sort of an oddball when it comes to media, as I don't care for it.\n\nWhat I do instead is I research topics and information from many sources, and I evaluate those sources. You see, back when I was doing my bachelor's degree and master's degree, I learned how to think critically and evaluate the information I encountered.\n\nMy experience of working for the government showed me first hand how to not \"believe what I'm told\" until I can see it with my own eyes, or to verify it through other credible sources.\n\n\n\nAnd I encourage all caring, thinking citizens to do the same.\n\nThe news does not exist to provide unbiased information. I worked in television. The news primarily is focused on fear. \n\n\n\nI urge you: Don't trust your health to the headlines. Don\u2019t trust your life to the media, and don\u2019t trust your well-being to the government.\n\n\n\nI started THE HEALTHY AMERICAN to share the research and links I\u2019ve uncovered, all with the goal to educate, inform and inspire you to take action to promote truth and freedom.\n\n\n\nYour support helps keep this ship afloat. The HEALTHY AMERICAN is a fully tax-paying business, so your donations are non-deductible, but they are an investment in your future, your children\u2019s future, and the future of our country.\n\nYour support helps me as I spend hours researching and creating videos to educate, inform and inspire others to take action to promote truth and freedom.\n\nWe are on the brink of going one way or the other \u2014 let\u2019s get you on board the ship so we can start to turn it in the right direction.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "About Peggy \u2014 THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/peggys-story", "type": "website", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/5ec4e4ed2bada63c9452655d/1595018019993/5-healthy+american+YT+%2811%29.png?format=1500w", "image:width": "1500", "image:height": "843"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
