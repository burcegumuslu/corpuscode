The mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d created by Moderna and Pfizer are in fact gene therapies.\n\nAs I\u2019ll explain below, there\u2019s simply no way around this, and drug manufacturers and public health officials must be made to admit this fact. Why? Because it makes all the difference in the world. You cannot mandate a gene therapy against COVID-19 any more than you can force entire populations to undergo gene therapy for a cancer they do not have and may never be at risk for.\n\nInterestingly enough, mainstream media, fact checkers and various industry front groups insist the gene therapy claim is bogus, even though every single detail about the vaccines shouts otherwise. Why are they spreading this disinformation? Why do they not want you to know what these injections actually are?\n\nIn short, they know labeling them as \u201cgene therapies\u201d would be like slapping a skull and crossbones label on them. Most people have enough common sense to realize that gene therapy is a different ballgame from a regular vaccination, and might be a bad idea, especially for children and younger individuals.\n\nmRNA \u2018Vaccines\u2019 Fulfill None of the Criteria for a Vaccine\n\nTo start, let\u2019s take a look at some basic definitions of words. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a vaccine is:1\n\u2022 \u201cA product that stimulates a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.\u201d\n\nImmunity, in turn, is defined as:\n\u2022 \u201cProtection from an infectious disease,\u201d meaning that \u201cIf you are immune to a disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the medical definition. The legal definition, in the few cases where it has been detailed, is equally unequivocal:\n\u2022 Iowa code \u2014 \u201cVaccine means a specially prepared antigen administered to a person for the purpose of providing immunity.\u201d\n\u2022 Washington state code , \u2014 \u201cVaccine means a preparation of a killed or attenuated living microorganism, or fraction thereof \u2026\u201d The statute also specifies that a vaccine \u201cupon immunization stimulates immunity that protects us against disease \u2026\u201d\n\nThese definitions, both medical and legal, present problems for mRNA \u201cvaccines,\u201d since:\n\u2022 mRNA injections do not impart immunity. Moderna and Pfizer both admit that their clinical trials aren\u2019t even looking at immunity. As such they do not fulfill the medical and/or legal definition of a vaccine.\n\u2022 They do not inhibit transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such they do not fulfill the medical and/or legal definition of a vaccine.\n\nWe should not be fooled by attempts to condition the public to accept redefined terms. As of February 2019, Merriam-Webster defined5 \u201cvaccine\u201d as \u201ca preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease.\u201d By February 26, 2021, they had updated the definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d to:6\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. Merriam-Webster does not dictate medical terminology. It can be used, however, to confuse people. For now, all medical dictionaries still show the traditional definition of vaccine,7 as Merriam-Webster did up until this year. That said, I would not be surprised if changes are made there as well, eventually, if the misrepresentation of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is allowed to stand.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of whether a gene therapy can be mandated, and this may hinge on it being accepted as a vaccine. The 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v. Massachusetts8 essentially established that collective benefit supersedes individual benefit.\n\nPut another way, the ruling argues (although legal experts diverge on some of the finer details of its interpretation) that it\u2019s acceptable for some individuals to be harmed by a public health directive as long as it benefits the collective. However, if vaccination is a public health measure meant to protect and benefit the collective, then it would need to accomplish two things:\n\u2022 Ensure that the vaccinated person is rendered immune from the disease.\n\u2022 Inhibit transmission of the disease from the vaccinated person to other individuals.\n\nWe\u2019re now back to the original problem that mRNA therapies for COVID-19 do not accomplish either of these things. Since these gene therapies do not render the person immune, and do not inhibit transmission of the virus, they cannot qualify as a public health measure capable of providing collective benefit that supersedes individual risk.\n\nOn the contrary, the only one benefiting from an mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d is the individual receiving the gene therapy, since all they are designed to do is lessen clinical symptoms associated with the S-1 spike protein.\n\nIn other words, they won\u2019t keep you from getting sick with SARS-CoV-2; they are only supposed to lessen your infection symptoms if or when you do get infected. So, getting vaccinated protects no one but yourself. Since you\u2019re the only one who will reap a benefit (less severe COVID-19 symptoms upon infection), the justification to accept the risks of the therapy \u201cfor the greater good\u201d of your community is blatantly irrational.\n\nSince mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d do not meet the medical and/or legal definition of a vaccine, referring to them as vaccines, and marketing them as such, is a deceptive practice that violates9 15 U.S. Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,10 the law that governs advertising of medical practices.\n\nThe lack of completed human trials also puts these mRNA products at odds with 15 U.S. Code Section 41. Per this law,11,12 it is unlawful to advertise \u201cthat a product or service can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The primary end point in the COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d trials is not an actual vaccine trial end point because, again, vaccine trial end points have to do with immunity and transmission reduction. Neither of those was measured.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, key secondary end points in Moderna\u2019s trial include prevention of severe COVID-19 disease (defined as need for hospitalization) and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms.13,14 However, Moderna did not actually measure rate of infection, stating that it was too \u201cimpractical\u201d to do so.\n\nThat means there\u2019s no evidence of this gene therapy having an impact on infection, for better or worse. And, if you have no evidence, you cannot fulfill the U.S. Code requirement that states you must have \u201ccompetent and reliable scientific evidence \u2026 substantiating that the claims are true.\u201d\n\nMaking matters worse, both Pfizer and Moderna are now eliminating their control groups by offering the real vaccine to any and all placebo recipients who want it.15 The studies are supposed to go on for a full two years, but by eliminating the control group, determining effectiveness and risks is going to be near impossible.\n\nAlright. Let\u2019s move on to the definition of \u201cgene therapy.\u201d As detailed on MedlinePlus.gov\u2019s \u201cWhat Is Gene Therapy\u201d page:16\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that there are many different treatments that have been shown to be very effective against COVID-19, so it certainly does not qualify as a disease that has no cure. It makes sense that gene therapy should be restricted to incurable diseases, as this is the only time that taking drastic risks might be warranted. That said, here\u2019s how the U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines gene therapy:17\n\nNovember 17, 2020, the American Society of Gene + Cell Therapy (ASGCT) announced \u201cCOVID-19 Vaccine Candidates Show Gene Therapy Is a Viable Strategy,\u201d noting that:18\n\nAs explained in the ASGCT\u2019s video above, mRNA are molecules that contain genetic instructions for making various proteins. mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d deliver a synthetic version of mRNA into your cells that carry the instruction to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the antigen, that then activates your immune system to produce antibodies. Then there\u2019s Moderna\u2019s trial website,19 where they describe their technology thus:\n\nImportantly, as reported by David Martin, Ph.D.,21,22 \u201cModerna \u2026 describes its product not as a vaccine, but as \u2018gene therapy technology\u2019 in SEC filings. This is because neither Moderna nor Pfizer \u2026 make any claims about their products creating immunity or preventing transmission.\u201d Additionally, Moderna\u2019s SEC filings specifically state that \u201cCurrently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA,\u201d as well.23\n\nClick here to watch the video.\n\nIn a February 2021 article, MIT Technology Review reviewed the history of mRNA technology in general, and Moderna\u2019s in particular, stating:24\n\nBloomberg, in August 2020, reported25 that the Moderna vaccine would seek to transform your body into \u201ca vaccine-making machine.\u201d The New York Times was more to the point. In May 2020, they reported26 that \u201cResearchers at two Harvard-affiliated hospitals are adapting a proven form of gene therapy to develop a coronavirus vaccine.\u201d Read it again \u2014 A proven form of gene therapy.\n\nSo, to summarize: The definition of \u201cgenetic\u201d is something relating to genes, and the definition of \u201ctherapy\u201d is the medical treatment of a disease. The definition of \u201cgene therapy\u201d is the process of modifying or manipulating the expression of a gene, or altering the biological properties of living cells.\n\nmRNA are snippets of genetic code that instructs cells to produce proteins. mRNA COVID-19 therapies \u201cdeliver genetic instructions into your cells,\u201d thereby triggering your body to produce a fragment of the virus (the spike protein). So, mRNA vaccines ARE gene therapy. There\u2019s simply no way around this. They fulfill all the definitions of gene therapy and none of the definitions for a vaccine.\n\nThere\u2019s yet one more potential problem with the \u201cCOVID-19 vaccine\u201d narrative as a whole, which Martin unpacked in a January 25, 2021, interview on the Wise Traditions podcast (above).27 In it, he explains:\n\nIn short, SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be definitively proven to be the actual cause of COVID-19. So, a gene therapy that instructs your body to produce a SARS-CoV-2 antigen \u2014 the viral spike protein \u2014 cannot even be touted as a preventative against COVID-19, as the two have not been shown to be causally linked.\n\nAs for why drug companies are misrepresenting this technology, Martin suspects \u201cit\u2019s done exclusively so that they can get themselves under the umbrella of public health laws that exploit vaccination.\u201d\n\nExperimental gene therapies do not have financial liability shielding from the government, but pandemic vaccines do, even in the experimental stage, as long as the emergency use authorization is in effect. This is indeed a major incentive to make sure this technology is perceived as a vaccine and nothing else.\n\nSo, by maintaining the illusion that COVID-19 is a state of emergency, when in reality it is not, government leaders are providing cover for these gene therapy companies so that they are insulated from any liability.\n\nI\u2019ve written many articles detailing the potential and expected side effects of these gene therapy \u201cvaccines.\u201d If all of this is new to you, consider reviewing \u201cHow COVID-19 Vaccine Can Destroy Your Immune System,\u201d \u201cSeniors Dying After COVID Vaccine Labeled as Natural Causes\u201d and \u201cSide Effects and Data Gaps Raise Questions on COVID Vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe take-home message here is that these injections are not vaccines. They do not prevent infection, they do not render you immune and they do not prevent transmission of the disease. Instead, they alter your genetic coding, turning you into a viral protein factory that has no off-switch. What\u2019s happening here is a medical fraud of unprecedented magnitude, and it really needs to be stopped before it\u2019s too late for a majority of people.\n\nIf you already got the vaccine and now regret it, you may be able to address your symptoms using the same strategies you\u2019d use to treat actual SARS-CoV-2 infection. I review these strategies at the end of \u201cWhy COVID Vaccine Testing Is a Farce.\u201d\n\nLast but not least, if you got the vaccine and are having side effects, please help raise public awareness by reporting it. The Children\u2019s Health Defense is calling on all who have suffered a side effect from a COVID-19 vaccine to do these three things:28\n\u2022 If you live in the U.S., file a report on VAERS\n\u2022 Report the injury on VaxxTracker.com, which is a nongovernmental adverse event tracker (you can file anonymously if you like)\n\u2022 Report the injury on the CHD website\n\nThe National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) recently posted more than 50 video presentations from the pay-for-view Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination held online October 16 to 18, 2020, and made them available to everyone for free.\n\nThe conference\u2019s theme was \u201cProtecting Health and Autonomy in the 21st Century\u201d and it featured physicians, scientists and other health professionals, human rights activists, faith community leaders, constitutional and civil rights attorneys, authors and parents of vaccine injured children talking about vaccine science, policy, law and ethics and infectious diseases, including coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn December 2020, a U.K. company published false and misleading information about NVIC and its conference, which prompted NVIC to open up the whole conference for free viewing. The conference has everything you need to educate yourself and protect your personal freedoms and liberties with respect to your health.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on this incredible opportunity. I was a speaker at this empowering conference and urge you to watch these video presentations before they\u2019re censored and taken away by the technocratic elite.\n\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.
