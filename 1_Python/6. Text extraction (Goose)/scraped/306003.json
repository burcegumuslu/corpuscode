Consider, for example, Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines. How successful was this technology in its first large-scale trial run in humans?\n\nA useful metric to cut through a lot of statistical noise is all-cause mortality. We can argue about the causes of death. Did this person die with COVID or from COVID? Was this fatality a vaccine side effect or a random temporal association? But we cannot argue about the body count. It is hard to spin death certificates. A recent preprint study in the medical journal The Lancet found that the mRNA vaccines showed no net benefit for all-cause mortality.\n\nStudy Finds mRNA Vaccines Didn\u2019t Do Their Job of Reducing Deaths. Did They Increase Deaths?\n\nFurthermore, CDC data, as well as data provided by life insurance companies stratified by age, showed a 40 percent rise in all-cause mortality among working-age adults (18- to 64-year-olds) in 2021 during the mass vaccination campaign, as compared to the previous five-year baseline. To put this into context, actuaries tell us that a 10 percent rise in all-cause mortality is a once in 200-year disastrous event. The United States didn\u2019t see this kind of spike even during World War II. When age groups were further stratified, life insurance mortality in quarter three of 2021 during the mass vaccination campaign showed even more alarming excess-mortality statistics among middle-aged adults:\n\nMost of these excess deaths were not due to COVID. Nor can missed screenings and missed medical appointments during lockdowns account for most of these deaths. If you skip a colonoscopy, you don\u2019t die the following year of colon cancer. You get a slight elevation in your risk of dying from cancer sometime in the next 10 to 20 years. Likewise if you have diabetes and miss your routine primary care appointment for a year, you might consequently have poorly controlled blood sugar for several months. This leads not to death a year later, but to a mildly elevated risk of diabetic complications much further down the road.\n\nIf It Wasn\u2019t COVID or Missed Medical Appointments, What Caused a Spike in Deaths?\n\nSomething else \u2014 something sudden and acute \u2014 happened in 2021 that massively affected mortality for young and middle-aged adults. Our public health establishment has shown no interest in examining this disaster. This total disinterest is a barometer of their priorities.\n\nHowever, along with other concerned doctors and scientists, I\u2019ve begun working with insurance industry executives and regulators who are keen on getting answers regarding vaccine safety and other potential causes of this dramatically increased mortality. But regardless of whether it turns out that vaccines caused net harm, it\u2019s at least clear that the mRNA vaccines produced no net mortality benefits for the population. (It may turn out that an age-stratified analysis will reveal overall benefit for the elderly offset by overall harm to the young \u2014 the jury is still out. My read of the current data suggests that any benefits to some populations will remain short-term and will be offset by longer-term problems.)\n\nWe Were Told the Jabs Wouldn\u2019t Alter Our DNA. Do They?\n\nWe were reassured time and again by the health establishment that mRNA vaccines would not alter our DNA. The conventional dogma in genetics for many years was that DNA is transcribed to RNA which is translated into proteins: the arrow moved only in this direction, or so we thought. But we now know the direction can sometimes be reversed by enzymes such as reverse transcriptase, the mechanism found in HIV viruses. A recent study found that mRNA from the COVID vaccines was inserted into the DNA of human liver cells in the lab (in vitro).\n\nThis finding needs to be reproduced in animal models (in vivo), but this study suggests that the reassurances that these vaccines could not change our DNA may have been premature. We are learning as we go with this technology: shooting (or jabbing) first and asking questions later. Despite the lackluster performance of the mRNA platform in its first mass rollout, enthusiasts remain undeterred. According to advocates, this was merely an early experiment for these genetic therapies (one cannot plausibly call them vaccines any longer, even with the CDC changing its definition of vaccine last year to accommodate these products).\n\nWe Must Demand Accountability From Authorities Trying to Push mRNA Tech\n\nOne notable mRNA technology enthusiast, Jamie Metzl, has an impressive pedigree. According to his bio, Metzl is \u201ca leading technology futurist\u201d and member of the WHO\u2019s international advisory committee on human genome editing. He is the author of five books, including Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity. Mr. Metzl also previously served on the U.S. National Security Council and with the United Nations.\n\nHe recently published an article in Newsweek on the future of mRNA technologies with the headline, \u201cMiraculous mRNA Vaccines Are Only the Beginning.\u201d Metzl claims that these vaccines offer an \u201cearly look at how the miraculous tools of the genetics revolution will transform our health care and our world over the coming years.\u201d We now have powers to hack our DNA, he opines, and \u201cthe new vaccines are perfect early examples of this \u2018godlike technology.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis mine.)\n\nThese are his words, not mine. Metzl explains, \u201cThe vaccines, in essence, transform our bodies into personalized manufacturing plants producing an otherwise foreign object to trigger our natural immune response.\u201d The possibilities are endless, he waxes: \u201cThis approach will soon create a whole new platform for fighting cancers and other diseases, as well as for providing enhancements even more profound than vaccination.\u201d\n\nWhile these transformations were well underway before the pandemic, COVID \u201csupercharged the genetics revolution,\u201d which \u201cwill soon touch our lives ever more intimately.\u201d This revolution will include not just enormous advances in agriculture, industry, and medicine, it will also \u201crecast our evolutionary trajectory as a species.\u201d\n\nTo Metzl\u2019s credit \u2014 and here I agree with him \u2014 he advises, \u201cThe future of our species and world is too important to be left to a small number of experts and officials. We each need to take responsibility for educating ourselves on these critical issues. \u2026 We must all be informed, empowered citizens demanding accountability from our leaders at all levels.\u201d\n\nThese are, indeed, among the reasons I wrote The New Abnormal: The Rise of the Biomedical Security State.\n\nDr. Aaron Kheriaty, M.D., is the author of The New Abnormal: The Rise of the Biomedical Security State and the director of the Bioethics and American Democracy program at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "mRNA: The Technocrats\u2019 \u2018Godlike Technology\u2019 - The Stream", "description": "Many of our technocrats seem undeterred by the failure of public health policies and associated new technologies to mitigate the COVID pandemic.
