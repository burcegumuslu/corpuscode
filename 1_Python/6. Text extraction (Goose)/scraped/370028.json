Due to the inflammation there usually occurs damage to the myelin sheath that covers the fibers of the nerve cells. Loss of myelin leads to interruption of the messages sent by nerves of the spinal cord all over the body. Homeopathy for Transverse Myelitis works well for symptomatic treatment when taken along with conventional treatment.\n\n It may result in muscle weakness, pain, sensory issues, paralysis, dysfunction of bowel or bladder.

However there are various reasons linked with it. Firstly it can develop from autoimmune activity in which the immune cells attack and damage the body\u2019s own healthy tissues.

Some of the viruses linked with it include EBV (epstein barr virus), herpes viruses, zika, mumps, Cytomegalovirus, measles, rubella, HIV, influenza. Among bacteria the ones associated with it are tuberculosis, syphilis, lyme disease, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus. Parasites and fungal agents may rarely cause it.
