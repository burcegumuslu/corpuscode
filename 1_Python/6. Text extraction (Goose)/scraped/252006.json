I don\u2019t have an opinion because I haven\u2019t thought about naturally acquired immunity,\u2019\u201d Paul said during a Fox Business News interview, adding, \u201cHe has and he is lying to you.\u201d\n\nPaul continued, \u201cThe reason he won\u2019t bring up natural immunity is because it foils his plans to get everybody possible vaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks it might slow down vaccination. And I\u2019m for people getting vaccinated particularly people at risk, but the thing is, if you ignore naturally acquired immunity then you\u2019re saying we don\u2019t have enough people, you have to force it on younger people,\u201d the Senator further urged.\n\n\u201cThere was a statistic that came out that somebody put together today. If you\u2019re 85, your chances of dying are 10,000 times greater than if you\u2019re 10. Should we treat a 10-year-old the same we treat an 85-year-old? It is nonsense,\u201d Paul reasoned.\n\nLast week Paul told Biden health secretary Xavier Becerra to his face that he is a \u2018arrogant, authoritarian, and un-American\u2019 for ridiculing people who choose natural immunity over vaccinations.\n\nPaul further warned that health officials are acting \u2018hysterical\u2019 when it comes to unvaccinated people, and that what they are claiming is \u201cactually the opposite of the truth.\u201d\n\nRead more at: Summit.news and also see RandPaul.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Video: Rand Paul blasts \u201clying\u201d Fauci; \u2018he ignores natural immunity because it foils his mass vaccination plan\u2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2021-10-08-rand-paul-blasts-lying-fauci.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "Senator Rand Paul charged that NIAID director Anthony Fauci is purposefully acting ignorant on the benefits of natural immunity to COVID because it would \u2018foil his mass vaccination plan,\u2019 further describing the notion that everyone needs to be vaccinated as \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Article by Steve Watson republished from Summit.news) \u201cHey, this guy has an opinion\u00a0on baseball, [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.randpaul.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/390/2022/05/Fauci-Mask-Hearing-Coronavirus.jpg"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "conspiracy", "big government", "covid-19", "medical fascism", "vaccine wars", "Rand Paul", "deception", "Medical Tyranny", "vaccines", "Anthony Fauci", "traitors", "lies", "propaganda"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://summit.news/2021/10/07/video-rand-paul-blasts-lying-fauci-he-ignores-natural-immunity-because-it-foils-his-mass-vaccination-plan/", "https://www.foxbusiness.com", "https://summit.news/2021/10/01/video-rand-paul-blasts-biden-health-secretary-this-is-an-arrogance-coupled-with-an-authoritarianism-that-is-unseemly-and-un-american/", "https://summit.news/2021/10/04/video-rand-paul-warns-health-authoritarians-are-hysterical-about-the-unvaccinated/", "https://summit.news/2021/10/07/video-rand-paul-blasts-lying-fauci-he-ignores-natural-immunity-because-it-foils-his-mass-vaccination-plan/", "http://randpaul.news", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Frandpaulnews%2F2021-10-08-rand-paul-blasts-lying-fauci.html&linkname=Video%3A%20Rand%20Paul%20blasts%20%E2%80%9Clying%E2%80%9D%20Fauci%3B%20%E2%80%98he%20ignores%20natural%20immunity%20because%20it%20foils%20his%20mass%20vaccination%20plan%E2%80%99", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
