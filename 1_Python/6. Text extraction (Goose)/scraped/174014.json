Only 17 women had miscarriages that might be linked with vaccination. But it\u2019s a troubling signal that they are following up on.\n\nIn the meantime, pregnant women are still urged to get flu vaccines because they and their unborn babies are at high risk from actually getting flu \u2014 and that\u2019s something that\u2019s been confirmed by many studies over a long time in tens of thousands of women.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Study Linking Miscarriage to Flu Vaccine Puzzles Doctors"}, "tags": ["study", "vaccine", "miscarriage", "puzzles", "doctors", "linking"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fstudy-linking-miscarriage-to-flu-vaccine-puzzles-doctors%2F&text=Study%20Linking%20Miscarriage%20to%20Flu%20Vaccine%20Puzzles%20Doctors", "https://gab.com/compose?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fstudy-linking-miscarriage-to-flu-vaccine-puzzles-doctors%2F&text=Study%20Linking%20Miscarriage%20to%20Flu%20Vaccine%20Puzzles%20Doctors", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/study-linking-miscarriage-to-flu-vaccine-puzzles-doctors/", "https://gettr.com/share?text=Study%20Linking%20Miscarriage%20to%20Flu%20Vaccine%20Puzzles%20Doctors&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fstudy-linking-miscarriage-to-flu-vaccine-puzzles-doctors%2F", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/study-linking-miscarriage-to-flu-vaccine-puzzles-doctors/", "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/study-linking-early-miscarriage-flu-vaccine-puzzles-doctors-n800981", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/food-supply-three-states-to-recall-61k-pounds-of-ready-to-eat-sausage-poultry-company-recalls-over-11k-pounds-of-frozen-turkey-patties/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/costco-reports-50-price-hikes-on-thousands-of-different-items-as-ceo-warns-of-difficult-times/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/why-did-fox-news-fire-tucker-carlson/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/big-corporations-out-of-nowhere-kroger-owned-frys-food-stores-kay-jewelers-hallmark-and-now-door-dash-have-all-sent-opt-out-of-mothers-day/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/meet-the-team-that-killed-bud-light/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/ray-epps-daughter-confirms-he-is-a-pedophile/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/world-bank-whistleblower-karen-hudes-lost-her-life-soon-after-a-series-of-interviews-like-this-can-you-guess-why/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/fda-vaccines-do-not-require-demonstration-of-the-prevention-of-infection-or-transmission/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/bed-bath-beyond-files-for-bankruptcy-reddit-leftists-freaking-out-after-buying-stock-in-get-rich-quick-scheme-feel-sick/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/the-dragon-is-on-fire/"], "authors": ["IWB"], "publish_date": "2023-03-02T19:26:01-05:00"}
