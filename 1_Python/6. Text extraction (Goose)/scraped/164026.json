Her death has devastated us, but we want to make something positive out of this, because that is what Rebecca would have wanted. Her aim in life was to help others. So please dig deep. Many of you are in financial hardship at the moment but any donation no matter how small will make a difference.\u201d\n\nThus far the page has raised \u00a310,150 of its target \u00a312,000.\n\nThey also wanted to make clear that Rebecca had not been working for them for \u201cmany months\u201d after false reports started circulating social media.\n\nRebecca\u2019s COVID-19 death follows that of NHS nurses Aimee O\u2019Rourke, Areema Nasreen, Liz Glanister and Alice Kit Tak Ong, midwife Lynsay Coventry, healthcare assistants John Alagos, Glen Corbin and Thomas Harvey and more.\n\nOur condolences go out to the families of the brave medical workers who have given their lives to this terrible disease.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this tragic news?
