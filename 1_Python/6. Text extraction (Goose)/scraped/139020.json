One of the clinical studies he is directing\u2014which is currently recruiting participants\u2014uses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety related to COVID-19. Fallon says that the value of mindfulness therapies extends to the health of the entire body, including the immune system. Similar studies are asking whether these therapies are beneficial for people with chronic Lyme disease. Fallon also studies the reasons for persistent cognitive impairment, fatigue, and pain among people with histories of Lyme and other diseases. \u201cSome of the people I was seeing had been told they were hypochondriacs, but I thought they were not hypochondriacs,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought they were suffering from something physical, something medical that hadn\u2019t yet been properly diagnosed. I started to wonder if some of these patients might have undetected Lyme disease.\u201d Fallon\u2019s book\u2014Conquering Lyme Disease: Science Bridges the Great Divide\u2014coauthored with Jennifer Sotsky, MD, is a comprehensive resource for anyone asking this question.\n\nCan you tell us about the clinical study on COVID-19-related anxiety that you\u2019re currently recruiting people for? When COVID-19 struck here in New York, it was an anxiety-provoking and somewhat terrifying time for those on the front lines. As a clinician, psychiatrist, and researcher, I thought we could create a study that could be launched quickly online that might be helpful to people suffering with anxiety during COVID-19. We decided that we could not have a comparison group that didn\u2019t also provide some benefit. So we have three groups, all of which get anxiety-reduction training using cognitive behavioral methods. We provide educational materials covering anxiety, worry, health fears, how thoughts influence our emotions, how certain thoughts and thought patterns can be destructive, and how thought patterns can be changed. In addition, two thirds of the people get augmentation with a mindfulness-based therapy. There are two types that we\u2019re using: One is meditation, and the other is Kundalini yoga. The meditation arm of the study practices breathing and meditation. Kundalini yoga is a daily practice that incorporates movement, light stretching, a certain type of breathing, and meditation. We are hoping that everybody will benefit from participating in this study, which is ongoing, but that perhaps those who get the mindfulness therapies will do a little bit better. Any kind of daily practice that becomes ritualized in a way that allows your body and your mind to slow down for about fifteen or thirty minutes a day can be very beneficial. You\u2019re allowing yourself to quiet the endless chatter that\u2019s in your brain and to breathe in a calming way, and that\u2019s enormously soothing. Our study will give that to patients as a practice, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a proven therapy for anxiety reduction.\n\nThis is for people who have not yet had COVID. These are the people who worry about getting COVID. These are the people who are anxious because they\u2019ve lost their jobs, or their jobs are insecure, or their financial stability is suffering, or someone they know has gotten sick or died, or they worry about their own symptoms excessively even though they haven\u2019t yet contracted COVID-19. It is an online study, open to anyone in the US. Right now, we have a little over 200 subjects. We hope to enroll as many people as we can and continue the study for another three or four months. [Editor\u2019s note: You can find more info here.]\n\nHow did you, a psychiatrist, come to do research on infectious diseases like Lyme disease and COVID-19? I started out in my training as a psychiatrist and got my board certification in psychiatry. I became very curious about hypochondria, which is when people worry about illness when they\u2019re not actually ill. I realized that some of the people I was seeing had been told they were hypochondriacs, but I thought they were not hypochondriacs. I thought they were suffering from something physical, something medical that hadn\u2019t yet been properly diagnosed. I started to wonder if some of these patients might have undetected Lyme disease. And some of them did. This was in the early \u201990s, when Lyme disease was a relatively new infection in the United States. I realized that a lot of people were struggling with persistent symptoms after Lyme disease that were due to either persistent infection or a postinfectious process. I decided to test different interventions to see what treatments work best for people who have persistent symptoms after Lyme disease.\n\nWhy is your focus on anxiety and mindfulness therapies? I\u2019m very interested in mind-body therapies because people need to be able to do something themselves to help modulate their own nervous system. We know that things like meditation and yoga can help the autonomic nervous system be more balanced so that the heart doesn\u2019t race and the breathing isn\u2019t too fast. So that your musculature is not so stressed out that you have pains in your head and down your spine and shooting pains down your leg. We know that anything that can be done to reduce stress can be enormously helpful for mental and physical functioning.\n\nCan you tell us about the clinical trial you are planning to do on persistent symptoms related to chronic Lyme disease? About 10 percent of people who contract the infection that causes Lyme disease suffer from persistent symptoms even though they get antibiotic therapy. Patients are calling it chronic Lyme disease, which is understandable. The academic community uses the term post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, which means you\u2019re not sure exactly what\u2019s causing the post-treatment Lyme symptoms. It might be an active infection, or it might be a postinfectious process. In many ways, the persistent symptoms associated with Lyme disease are similar to what people are reporting now after COVID-19: fatigue, muscle pains, brain fog. I think some of the treatments that might be helpful for the post-Lyme patients may also be helpful for the COVID-19 long-haulers\u2014the people who have persistent symptoms after COVID-19. With the Lyme disease study, we are again going to be comparing meditation and Kundalini yoga. We\u2019ll be posting the various studies on our website. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, and Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium, and the symptom profile is very similar in these post-viral and post-bacterial disorders. But they\u2019re not necessarily the same disorders. We did a study where we compared the spinal fluid of chronic fatigue patients, and patients after treatment for Lyme disease who had persistent cognitive problems. We found that even though they both look like they have chronic fatigue syndrome, the Lyme disease patients had 600 unique proteins that weren\u2019t there in the chronic fatigue patients. And the chronic fatigue patients, in turn, had 600 unique proteins that weren\u2019t there in the Lyme group. So even though symptoms may be similar, they\u2019re not exactly the same.\n\nCan you tell us about the clinical study you are carrying out on a drug to treat chronic Lyme disease? We\u2019re doing a study now looking at a medicine called disulfuram, which is a psychiatric medication. It\u2019s commonly known as Antabuse, and it\u2019s used to help alcoholics stop drinking. If you drink when you\u2019re taking Antabuse, you have a violent bodily reaction that you don\u2019t want to get ever again, because it\u2019s very, very unpleasant. So people who are on disulfuram generally do not drink. From screening thousands of compounds, we have recently learned that disulfuram is one of the most effective agents against the Lyme bacterium. It\u2019s more effective, at least in a lab setting, than standard treatments for Lyme disease. So the question is: Is it possible that some of these patients who have persistent symptoms may have a persistent infection that disulfuram could eradicate? There are some clinicians in the community who\u2019ve been giving disulfuram to their patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms and they\u2019re reporting generally good results. However, disulfiram needs to be carefully studied\u2014both for safety and to test whether it leads to improvement. Disulfuram is not something to take lightly as it can have serious side effects. If you have any exposure to alcohol while you\u2019re on this drug, you could have a very severe physical reaction. If you have heart disease when you have a disulfiram-alcohol physical reaction, you could have a heart attack. You want to be carefully monitored when taking disulfuram. We are recruiting now for this study, and we just got approval to do it remotely. I\u2019m very optimistic about medicine and about science right now. Just look at the COVID-19 pandemic. We have three or more vaccines that are almost ready to go. That\u2019s phenomenal to see so much progress in the course of less than a year. And the treatments that we have now have dramatically reduced the death rates that previously had been reported for COVID-19.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mindfulness Therapies for COVID-19-Related Anxiety and Persistent Lyme Disease Symptoms | goop", "description": "\u201cSome of the people I was seeing had been told they were hypochondriacs, but I thought they were not hypochondriacs,\u201d says psychiatrist Brian Fallon. \u201cI started to wonder if some of these patients might have undetected Lyme disease.\u201d Fallon studies Kundalini yoga, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety related to COVID-19 and Lyme disease.
