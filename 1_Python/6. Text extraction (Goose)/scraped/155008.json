This is roughly three times as many people as were killed and maimed in World War One, and is comparable to WWII losses. Yet this modern plague has slipped down the memory hole. Why? \n\n\n\nWas it a deliberate ploy by the Illuminati to finish the job WWI began?\n\n\n\nThis repost is inspired by this article: The Spanish Flu- Only the Vaccinated Died\n\nAlso, Vaccines were used and may have been a factor. And also US Vaccines Caused Spanish Flu\n\nGestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller told his CIA interrogator that the Spanish Flu was caused by a \"double blow\" virus. Could the first blow \"which attacked the immune system\" have actually been a vaccine? \n\n\n\nMueller: \"I am not a doctor, you understand, but the 'double-blow' referred to a virus, or actually a pair of them that worked like a prize fighter. The first blow attacked the immune system and made the victim susceptible, fatally so, to the second blow which was a form of pneumonia...[Schreiber told me] a British scientist actually developed it...Now you see why such things are insanity. These things can alter themselves and what starts out as a limited thing can change into something really terrible.\" \n\n\n\nIn 1948, Heinrich Mueller, the former head of the Gestapo, told his CIA Interrogator that the influenza pandemic of 1918-19, the most devastating plague in human history, was man-made. \n\n\n\nMueller said the flu started as an US army bacteriological warfare experiment that somehow infected US army ranks at Camp Riley KS in March 1918, and spread around the world. He says that it \"got out of control\" but we cannot discount the horrible possibility that the \"Spanish Flu\" was a deliberate elite depopulation measure. Researchers have found connections between it and the \"Bird Flu.\"\n\nIt was called the Spanish Flu because the first human case was identified there. Understandably there was panic worldwide, as influenza was not discovered until 1933, so the mystery ailment was rather frightening.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: \"In the U.S., about 28% of the population suffered, and 500,000 to 675,000 died. In Britain 200,000 died; in France more than 400,000. Entire villages perished in Alaska and southern Africa. In Australia, an estimated 10,000 people died and in the Fiji Islands, 14% of the population died during only two weeks, and in Western Samoa 22%. An estimated 17 million died in India, about 5% of India's population. In the Indian Army, almost 22% of troops who caught the disease died of it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, \"One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred. ...Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65 and more-than-half in young adults 20 to 40 years old. This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). \"\n\n\n\n MUELLER'S SOURCE \n\n \n\n At a 1944 Nazi bacteriological warfare conference in Berlin, General Walter Schreiber, Chief of the Medical Corps of the German Army told Mueller that he had spent two months in the US in 1927 conferring with his counterparts. They told him that the \"so-called double blow virus\" (i.e. Spanish Flu) was developed and used during the 1914 war.\n\n\"But,\" according to Mueller, left, \"it got out of control and instead of killing the Germans who had surrendered by then, it turned back on you, and nearly everybody else.\" (\"Gestapo Chief: The 1948 CIA Interrogation of Heinrich Mueller\" Vol. 2 by Gregory Douglas, p. 106)\n\nMueller: \"I am not a doctor, you understand, but the 'double-blow' referred to a virus, or actually a pair of them that worked like a prize fighter. The first blow attacked the immune system and made the victim susceptible, fatally so, to the second blow which was a form of pneumonia...[Schreiber told me] a British scientist actually developed it...Now you see why such things are insanity. These things can alter themselves and what starts out as a limited thing can change into something really terrible.\"\n\nThe subject of the Spanish Flu arose in the context of a discussion of typhus. The Nazis deliberately introduced typhus into Russian POW camps and, along with starvation, killed about three million men. The typhus spread to Auschwitz and other concentration camps with Russian and Polish POWS.\n\nIn the context of the Cold War, Mueller says: \"If Stalin invades Europe...a little disease here and there would wipe out Stalin's hoards and leave everything intact. Besides, a small bottle of germs is so much cheaper than an atom bomb, isn't it? Why you could hold more soldiers in your hand than Stalin could possibly command and you don't have to feed them, clothes them or supply them with munitions. On the other hand, the threat of war...does wonders... for the economy.\" (108)\n\nIs Mueller credible? In my opinion he is. Gregory Douglas apparently is a pseudonym for his nephew with whom he left his papers. Normally a hoax would not run to thousands of pages. The Interrogation is 800 pages. The Memoirs are 250 pages. The microfilmed Archive apparently covers 850,000 pages. Finally, the material I have read is incredibly well informed, consistent and full of plausible revelations .\n\nThe Illuminati have made no secret of its desire to decrease the world population. (See Alan Stang, Population Extermination: How Will it be Done? )\n\nIt's possible that World War One was a disappointment in terms of the numbers killed. Whether the \"Spanish Flu\" was deliberate or not, we cannot say. But apparently the US Army has a record of experimenting with drugs/chemicals/bacteria on unwary soldiers. Did such an experiment get \"out of control\" at Fort Riley? Or was that its purpose in the first place?\n\nSee also \"Hitler's Gestapo Chief Became Top Truman Advisor\"\n\nSee also \"The Influenza Pandemic of 1918\"\n\nActually 90,000 and that Each Infected Person In Turn Infects 14.\n\n\n\nThe Spanish flu never existed. Dr. Eleanor McBean, 1905-1989, was a physician who exposed the mendacity of the health care cartel in her books. Nowadays, hardly anyone knows her, which is very unfortunate. In chapter 2 of her book Swine Flu Expose she explains about the Spanish flu.\n\nhttp://www.whale.to/vaccine/sf.html (Click chapter 2)\n\nDr. Eleanor McBean writes in her book \"Vaccines biggest medical fraud in history\" page 173 chapter VIRUSES ARE NOT THE CAUSE (reminiscent of Dr. Thomas Cowan) about viruses the following, I quote from the book:\n\nhttps://fdocc2.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/the-poisoned-needle-by-eleanor-mcbean-1957-is-a-classic-that-you-need-to-know-to-be-medically-informed/ (Scroll down a little)\n\nNo viruses, germs or bacteria cause any disease. These organisms are useful parts of each cell, and take part in the building of the cell, and later in the disintegration of the cell when its life cycle is completed. The fact that they are seen under the microscope of the lab men when they are examining diseased tissue, does not prove that they caused the disease. The medical and drug fields are at least 30 years behind times. Their faulty theories are the cause of much disabling illness. Practically all diseases are caused by body poisoning, as stated before. Vaccines, drugs, tobacco, and poison food additives are among the worst of the poisoners. Vaccines do not build antibodies to fight germs. That whole concept is false and leads people and doctors away from the real cause of disease, which is body\n\npoisoning. (For more details, see my forthcoming book, Vaccination Condemned).\n\nThere are doctors who are aware of this hoax and unfortunately it is very old. We are experiencing the remake of the Spanish flu, which is now called Covid-19 and was never a danger for the people.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://henrymakow.com/ads/hm.png", "image:width": "200", "image:height": "200", "site_name": "HenryMakow.com", "url": "https://henrymakow.com/001836.html", "title": " Was Spanish Flu Caused by Vaccines?
