This freedom of voluntary transaction is the core of what we used to call our free society. But in an America paralyzed by fear\u2014ramped up by a mainstream media that churns out propaganda at a level unparalleled in history\u2014no one is allowed to enjoy themselves.\n\nThankfully, everyone carries a smartphone these days and can record and upload the frequent violations of our constitutional liberties. In the case of the waffle restaurant, thanks to a cell phone video we saw the police show up in force and try to push through the crowd waiting outside. An elderly man who was next in line to enter was indignant, complaining that he had been waiting two hours to eat at the restaurant and was not about to step aside while the police shut down the place. The police proceeded to violently handcuff and arrest the man, dragging him off while his wife followed sadly behind him to the police car.\n\nIt is hard not to be disgusted by government enforcers who would brutally drag an elderly man away from a restaurant for the \u201ccrime\u201d of wanting to take his wife out for breakfast on Mother\u2019s Day. A virus far more deadly than the coronavirus is spreading from Washington down to the local city hall. Tin pot dictators are ruling by decree while federal, state, and local legislators largely stand by and watch as the Constitution they swore to protect goes up in smoke.\n\nPoliticians with perfect haircuts issue \u201cexecutive orders\u201d that anyone cutting hair for mere private citizens must be arrested. In Texas a brave salon owner willingly went to jail for the \u201ccrime\u201d of re-opening her business in defiance of \u201cexecutive orders.\u201d To add insult to injury, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott very quickly condemned the one-week jail sentence of salon owner Shelley Luther\u2014but the officers who arrested her were only carrying out Abbott\u2019s own orders.\n\nFirst we were told we had to shut down the country to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d so that hospitals were not overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. When most hospitals were nowhere near overwhelmed, and in fact were laying off thousands of healthcare workers because there were no patients, they moved the goalposts and said we cannot have our freedom back until a vaccine was available to force on us or the virus completely disappeared\u2014neither of which is likely to happen anytime soon.\n\nMany politicians clearly see the creeping totalitarianism but lack the courage to speak out. Thankfully, patriots like Shelley Luther are demonstrating the courage our political leaders lack.\n\nWhen Patrick Henry famously said, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death\u201d in 1775, he didn\u2019t add under his breath \u201cunless a virus shows up.\u201d If we wish to reclaim our freedoms, we will have to fight\u2014peacefully\u2014for them. As Thomas Paine wrote in 1776, \u201cThese are the times that try men\u2019s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\u201d\n\nRon Paul, a former U.S. representative from Texas and medical doctor, continues to write his weekly column for the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, online at www.ronpaulinstitute.org.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["mainstream media", "Coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://www.johnellis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Revelation_x264.mp4?_=1", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/profiles-in-corruption-abuse-of-power-by-americas-progressive-elite/", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
