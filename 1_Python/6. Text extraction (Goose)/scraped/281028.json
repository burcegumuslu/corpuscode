Watch the excellent 1979 CBS report (15 minutes) about this episode or read the September 2020 New York Times piece about it.\n\nEarly reports of GBS after covid vaccinations were first ignored (\u2018no causality\u2019) and then described as \u2018extremely rare\u2019. However, a quick search of publicly available case reports indicates that in the US alone, there may already be several hundred confirmed cases of post-vaccination GBS, both after mRNA and adenovector vaccines.\n\nAs with other serious vaccine adverse events, GBS may affect young and healthy people at low risk of severe covid. The case of a Nashville mother of three was recently covered by a local TV station. Both health authorities and people at low risk of severe covid may want to carefully examine the evidence concerning GBS and other non-trivial potential covid vaccine adverse events.\n\nUpdate: On June 10, the German Paul Ehrlich Institute confirmed that GBS occurred \u201cat an increased rate\u201d after AstraZeneca vaccinations and might constitute a \u201cnew risk signal\u201d. Note that GBS most certainly isn\u2019t limited to AstraZeneca, which isn\u2019t even used in the United States.\n\u2022 On the treatment of covid-19", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome after covid vaccination", "description": "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an auto-immune neurological disease that causes muscle weakness and paralysis, usually starting in the feet and hands, with about 20% of people still unable to walk at 6 months, and a fatality rate of about 5%.", "url": "https://swprs.org/guillain-barre-syndrome-after-covid-vaccination/", "site_name": "Swiss Policy Research", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-18T10:08:15+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gbs-covid-vaccine.png?fit=1920%2C1080&ssl=1", "image:width": "1920", "image:height": "1080", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gbs-covid-vaccine.png?ssl=1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://swprs.org/guillain-barre-syndrome-after-covid-vaccination/", "https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://swprs.org/guillain-barre-syndrome-after-covid-vaccination/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome", "https://swprs.org/vaccines-successes-and-controversies/#b2-1976-swine-flu-pandemic-vaccine-injuries-cbs-1979", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-trump.html", "https://www.physiciansweekly.com/guillain-barre-case-reported-after-covid-19-vaccination", "https://t.me/s/covidvaccineinjuries/", "https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/tga-probe-into-guillainbarre-syndrome-diagnoses-in-eight-patients-after-astrazeneca-vaccine/news-story/6b3036bdef7895446b02d300aee808b9", "https://twitter.com/McfaddenBrandy/status/1401380755754848256", "https://t.me/s/covidvaccineinjuries/", "https://t.me/s/covidvaccineinjuries/", "https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/dossiers/sicherheitsberichte/sicherheitsbericht-27-12-bis-31-05-21.pdf", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccine-adverse-events/", "#see-also", "https://swprs.org/vaccines-successes-and-controversies/", "https://swprs.org/covid-rna-vaccines-deaths/", "https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://swprs.org/guillain-barre-syndrome-after-covid-vaccination/", "https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://swprs.org/guillain-barre-syndrome-after-covid-vaccination/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
