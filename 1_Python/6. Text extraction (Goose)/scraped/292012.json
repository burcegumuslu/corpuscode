Frankly, they couldn\u2019t have provided better explanatory statements.\n\nA very interesting part is the data from Eudravigilance, which is the pharmacovigilance database of the European Union.\n\nWhose data are really shocking.\n\nThe ruling says: \u201cThe data which have been collected by the European database reveal that by the end of January 2022, 570 million Pfizer doses had been administered within the EU, so far.\n\nIn relation to them, 582,000 cases of adverse effects were reported, 7,000 of which had a fatal outcome.\u201d\n\nThat was Pfizer. As for AstraZeneca, \u201camong 69 million doses, 244,000 cases of adverse effects were reported, 1,447 of which had a fatal outcome.\u201d\n\nThen they mention Moderna, too. 139 million doses, 150,000 adverse reactions, 834 of which had a fatal outcome.\n\nThen Janssen. 19 million doses, 40,766 cases reported, 279 of which were fatal.\n\n\u201cMost of the aforementioned side effects are undoubtedly mild.\n\nBut among those effects, there are also serious pathologies which in some cases are likely to compromise the vaccinated patient\u2019s health irreversibly,\u201d and that is exactly the point.\n\nCausing disability, or in the most unfortunate cases, death.\n\nSo therefore it is doubtful whether such medical products, whose data about the adverse reactions are being collected, fulfill the aforementioned constitutional requirement.\u201d\n\nAnd then they wrote nine spectacular lines.\n\nAnd I wonder what Giuliano Amato will write about those lines.\n\nSince he is a politicized person, and in line with the Government\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the cases of serious adverse effects turn out to be a small portion.\u201d\n\nPlease, listen to this: \u201cnevertheless, the criterion set by the Constitutional Court,\u201d\n\n\u201cThe criterion set by the Constitutional Court for compulsory medical treatments to be enforced is not likely to include a quantitative evaluation.\n\nSo the lawfulness of a mandatory vaccination is to be excluded, if it uses products whose effects on the vaccinated patients\u2019 health exceed the threshold of normal tolerability.\n\nWhich cannot include the risk of serious or fatal adverse effects, even if these are small portion in relation to the vaccinated population.\u201d\n\nSo, even if they are few, one fatal effect suffices to make this inadmissible.\n\n\u201cAnd even in the case we accept the risk of \u2014 albeit rare \u2014 fatal adverse effects, this criterion would have sensitive ethical implications.\u201d\n\nFor instance, who would determine the percentage of disposable citizens?\n\nIt is indisputable. Otherwise it results in Nazism.\n\nIt is indisputable. If the Constitutional Court rules against this judgment, it means its members are servants of politics.\n\nThey are politicians, not jurists. A jurist cannot but reach the same conclusion as this ruling.\n\nIf the members of the court rule differently, it means they are not ignorant, of course, but surely someone extremely biased and politicized.\n\nSomeone to dismiss faster than the speed of light.\n\nSo we should challenge them on this matter, and on the duty to state grounds.\n\u2022 Italy goes psycho after Agriculture Minister says 'Italians are being Replaced'\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDid you like this information?
