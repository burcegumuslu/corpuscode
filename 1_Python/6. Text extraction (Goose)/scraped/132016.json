(Related: Nashville transgender Christian school shooting occurred just days after \u201cTrans Day of Vengeance\u201d protest.)\n\nThe organization was moving forward with its planned protest for the rights of American transgenders despite the fact that, just days before, a transgender person entered the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, killing six people, including three nine-year-old children.\n\nThe shooter, Audrey Hale, went by the name Aiden and identified herself as a male. Metropolitan Nashville Police Department Chief John Drake confirmed that \u201cthere is some theory\u201d to concerns that transgender propaganda and Hale\u2019s self-identification as a male played a role in the shooter\u2019s decision to commit mass murder.\n\nTwitter\u2019s head of trust and safety Ella Irwin claimed that the images involving the \u201cTrans Day of Vengeance\u201d were automatically compiled and deleted from the platform because Twitter \u201cdoes not support tweets that incite violence, irrespective of who posts them.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Vengeance\u2019 does not imply peaceful protest,\u201d said Irwin. \u201cOrganizing or support for peaceful protests is okay.\u201d\n\nTRAN claims the so-called peaceful protest in front of the Supreme Court was planned before Hale\u2019s mass shooting and was not in any way a call to violence.\n\n\u201cVengeance means fighting back with vehemence,\u201d claimed the radical organization on its website. \u201cWe are fighting against false narratives, criminalization and the eradication of our existence.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the suppression of free speech on social media platforms at Suppressed.news.\n\nWatch this video discussing in detail Twitter\u2019s \u201ccensorship industrial complex,\u201d supported by non-government organizations, mainstream media outlets and governments.\n\nThis video is from the Andrew Zebrun III channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nTwitter Files: US government helped launch project where millions of online posts were flagged for censorship.\n\nBREAKING: Twitter Files detail the \u201ccensorship-industrial complex,\u201d revealing an \u201cincestuous self-appointed truth squad\u201d made up of media, government and NGOs.\n\nTwitter exposes how government funded a \u201ccottage industry\u201d of \u201cdisinformation labs\u201d that were used to censor real info and ban truth tellers.\n\nFormer Twitter execs GRILLED by House Republicans over censorship, possible violations of the Constitution.", "opengraph": {"title": "Twitter temporarily suspends New York Post account for exposing the platform\u2019s removal of over 5,000 tweets", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-04-02-twitter-temporarily-suspends-new-york-post.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "So-called \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter temporarily\u00a0locked out the\u00a0New York Post on Thursday, March 30, after it tweeted out a story about how the social media company deleted over 5,000 tweets.
