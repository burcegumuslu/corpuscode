It was recently reported that there was a simulation regarding a monkeypox outbreak that happened just last year, similar to Event 201 preceding the COVID 19 crisis. Is this a bioweapon that was designed and released upon the public now that people are no longer as scared of COVID or is something else going on?\n\nI recently saw this image being shared around. On the left is a rash supposedly caused by monkeypox and on the right are reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSo could it be that the people who are being diagnosed with \u201cmonkeypox\u201d are actually just dealing with side effects to COVID shots?\n\nThe reports on skin rashes would like us to believe that they are perfectly normal, that they only occur after the shots are administered, and that the vaccines are still safe and effective. The vaxx shills do not want people thinking that these skin reactions are a reason to not get shot up.\n\nFrom the American Academy of Dermatology:\n\nIn addition to studying a large spectrum of skin reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines, the researchers assessed patients\u2019 responses from the first dose to the second. They found that less than half of the people who experienced skin reactions after the first dose experienced a reaction after the second, and if they did, it was milder. \u201cI hope this information encourages more people to get their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine even if they experienced a skin reaction after their first dose,\u201d says Dr. Freeman. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccine will help protect you from getting the virus and can also prevent you from getting very sick if you do get infected.\u201d\n\nCould it be that skin reactions can also occur even well after the doses were administered and that is what we are witnessing around the world? Perhaps one did not even need to get the shot to be experiencing these symptoms due to people \u201cshedding\u201d spike proteins, spreading sickness to those who chose not to receive experimental gene therapy injections. It is also possible that this monkeypox scare is something else entirely, related to a new bioweapon that was released upon the public, in order to push more lockdowns, quarantines, and vaccinations. It is perfectly timed with the new WHO Pandemic Treaty.", "opengraph": {"title": "Was the New Monkeypox Scare Designed to Cover Up the Side Effects of COVID Vaccines?", "description": "All of a sudden the talking heads of the world have all been ramping up the scare tactics around the newest plague - monkeypox.", "image": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pu2357414-image-kwvwiin3.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/was-the-new-monkeypox-scare-designed-to-cover-up-the-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines/", "site_name": "Renegade Tribune", "article:published_time": "2022-05-23T11:58:14+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-26T12:53:06+00:00", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "533"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.renegadetribune.com/monkeypox-was-a-table-top-simulation-only-last-year/", "https://www.massgeneral.org/news/press-release/skin-reactions-after-covid-19-vaccination-rare-uncommonly-recur-after-second-dos#:~:text=Skin%20problems%20such%20as%20itchiness,with%20a%20subsequent%20vaccination.", "http://wtrf.com/", "https://www.wtrf.com/news/health/coronavirus/", "https://www.aad.org/news/covid-vaccine-skin-reactions-possible", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/support-with-cryptocurrencies/", "https://gab.com/compose?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwas-the-new-monkeypox-scare-designed-to-cover-up-the-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines%2F&text=Was%20the%20New%20Monkeypox%20Scare%20Designed%20to%20Cover%20Up%20the%20Side%20Effects%20of%20COVID%20Vaccines%3F", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=Was%20the%20New%20Monkeypox%20Scare%20Designed%20to%20Cover%20Up%20the%20Side%20Effects%20of%20COVID%20Vaccines%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwas-the-new-monkeypox-scare-designed-to-cover-up-the-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines%2F", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwas-the-new-monkeypox-scare-designed-to-cover-up-the-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines%2F&title=Was%20the%20New%20Monkeypox%20Scare%20Designed%20to%20Cover%20Up%20the%20Side%20Effects%20of%20COVID%20Vaccines%3F", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwas-the-new-monkeypox-scare-designed-to-cover-up-the-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines%2F&text=Was%20the%20New%20Monkeypox%20Scare%20Designed%20to%20Cover%20Up%20the%20Side%20Effects%20of%20COVID%20Vaccines%3F", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/was-the-new-monkeypox-scare-designed-to-cover-up-the-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines/", "http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com", "http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/kyle-hunt/", "http://hellstormdocumentary.com", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/house-passes-resolution-increasing-censorship-under-the-guise-of-fighting-antisemitism/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/earliest-aryan-script-found-in-indus-valley/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-05-23T11:58:14+00:00"}
