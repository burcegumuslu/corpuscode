(dictionary.com) Until recently, the controllers have been quite successful at insulting the idea that there might actually be conspiracies going on. \u201cConspiracy theorists\u2026 wackos\u2026 paranoid nut cases.\u201d It has been made socially unacceptable to challenge big lies that we are told, because someone might make fun of us. But \u201cconspiracy THEORY\u201d has been turning into \u201cconspiracy ANALYSIS\u201d and finally into conspiracy FACT. When President George Bush Sr. got busted for covertly selling arms to the Contras, his administration was convicted of \u2026Conspiracy. When the AMA tried to shut down the emergence of Chiropractic, they were found guilty of \u2026Conspiracy. Here are a few more of countless examples of proven conspiracies:\n\u2022 10 More Conspiracy Theories That Came True\n\u2022 33 Conspiracy Theories That Turned Out To Be True And here are some well-informed voices from 20th century history: \u201cSince I entered politics, I have chiefly had men\u2019s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the Field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\u201d \u201cThe powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds\u2019 central banks which were themselves private corporations. The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups.\u201d \u2014 Professor Carroll Quigley of Georgetown University, highly esteemed by his former student, William Jefferson Blythe Clinton, in Tragedy and Hope: A History of The World in Our Time (Macmillan Company, 1966) \u201cThe drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control\u2026 Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.\u201d \u2014 Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the crash of a Korean Airlines 747 \u201cWe are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.\u201d \u201cIn the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn\u2019t such a great idea after all.\u201d \u2014 Strobe Talbot, President Clinton\u2019s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in , July 20th, l992 \u201cWe shall have world government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent.\u201d \u2014 James Warburg, member of Council on Foreign Relations, in his statement to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950 \u201cIt seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this: That we are in the process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist, to get people to love their servitude.\u201d\n\nWHO is Implementing the Agenda? Efforts to conquer and colonize are as old as history, but it was creating the deception of \u201cmonopolized central banking\u201d - where a few individuals get to just make up money out of nothing \u2013 and \u201cfractional reserve\u201d lending \u2013 where bankers get to lend and charge interest on money they don\u2019t actually have - that gave the elite the means by which they could hope to actually rule the world. The first central bank was the Bank of Amsterdam - founded in 1609 \u2013 and then in 1694 King William III teamed up with UK aristocracy to launch the private Bank of England. Elite private bankers \u2013 including the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and Morgans \u2013 and members of such secret societies as the Council on Foreign Relations, The Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, and the Royal Institute of Affairs are setting and implementing the current agenda. *Secret Societies\n\n\"The governments of the present day have to deal not merely with other governments, with emperors, kings and ministers, but also with the secret societies which have everywhere their unscrupulous agents, and can at the last moment upset all the governments' plans. \" \"The Council on Foreign Relations is \"the establishment.\" Not only does it have influence and power in key decision-making positions at the highest levels of government to apply pressure from above, but it also announces and uses individuals and groups to bring pressure from below, to justify the high level decisions for converting the U.S. from a sovereign Constitutional Republic into a servile member state of a one-world dictatorship.\" \"The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power \u2014 political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation states involved. As managers and creators of the system, they will rule the future.\" - U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his l964 book: With No Apologies. Control of currencies is the core of their power methodology. The elite financed Mussolini and Hitler, planned WWI and II, and financed all sides in order to cull the population and consolidate their power. For more than a century, their goal has been to create a single global government. The attempt to create a League of Nations after WWI Was funded by the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. The plan failed, but was revived as the United Nations after WWII on land in New York gifted by the Rockefellers. As wonderful as it\u2019s made out to be, with its diversity and \u201cpeacekeepers,\u201d the UN seems to be the front organization for the One World Authority \u2013with NATO as its militant arm and the World Bank as its financial enforcer. All the organizations below as well as the World Health Organization, The World Trade Organization were created by the Rockefellers, Rothschilds or Morgans. Only a handful of nations \u2013 like Iran, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and until recently Iraq \u2013 have not succumbed to the elite\u2019s central banking takeover scheme. This seems to play a major unspoken role in determining the New World Order\u2019s imperialist hit-list, the so-called \u201caxis of evil.\u201d To see a detailed history of the establishment of the current U.S. central banking system, the suppression of alternatives, and the manipulation of economic booms and busts by these elite private bankers, click here. To see how these same elite bankers have gained control not only over our money system, but over almost every other sector of human activity, check out the \u201cFollow the Money\u201d section of the site. As described in the timeline, the Rothschilds are the oldest, wealthiest and most powerful European Central Banking family. Their rise to financial dominance began with Mayer Amschel Rothschild in Frankfurt, Germany where he set up a finance house. His five sons were spread throughout Europe in the late 1700s and early 1800s \u2013 in Frankfurt, Vienna, London, Naples, and Paris \u2013 forming a financial dynasty. In June of 1815, Nathan Rothschild\u2019s secret courier network was the first to make it back to London with news that Napoleon\u2019s French troops had been defeated by the British at Waterloo. Rothschild, who, as usual, had funded both sides in the war, cunningly pretended that the French had won and started dumping British \u201cconsuls\u201d on the stock exchange. The market plummeted and then Nathan quietly started buying up everything in sight, and by the time the real news of Britain\u2019s success in the battle reached the public in London, the House of Rothschild had bought control of the British economy. By the mid 1800s they dominated the banking industry, funding people such as the Morgans, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Cecil Rhodes. The Rothschilds\u2019 influence spread to the U.S. as well. They financed the house of Morgan and sent associate Paul Warburg, a partner in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. to meet with other private bankers on Jekyll Island to secretly draft the Federal Reserve Act that was passed in 1913. This allowed bankers to create 90% of our money supply and loan it out at interest \u2013 a sure way to be highly profitable and influential while also allowing private bankers to run the national economy. Indeed, as Mayer Amschel Rothschild once said, \u201cGive me control over a nation\u2019s currency, and I care not who makes its laws.\u201d The Rothschilds continue to wield tremendous power and control, though virtually always behind the scenes. Some researchers have estimated their fortune today could exceed $100 trillion. (The Federal Reserve Cartel: Part III by Dean Henderson) \n\n\n\n Today, N.M. Rothschild & Sons is their main investment banking operation based out of London. It is one of the top 10 global investment banks for M&A advisory. In 2007, they did $566 billion worth of trades, more than 12% of the market share \u2013 and this is just what is known publicly. They have banks set up all over the world, making them shareholders in numerous Central Banks and granting them tremendous decision-making powers. In 1998, Gaylon Ross Sr, author of Who\u2019s Who of the Global Elite, wrote that he had been tipped by a private source that the combined wealth of the Rothschild family was then approximately $100 Trillion and that of the Rockefellers was $11 Trillion. The Rockefellers are particularly dominant in America. They got started in the 19th century with funding from JP Morgan, who was the American front man for the Rothschilds. John D. Rockefeller was funded to help develop and control oil resources. As oil increased in demand, John D. Rockefeller\u2019s wealth grew and he became the first American billionaire. With this money came a tremendous amount of power and control, not only in oil, but all sectors of society. Much of the family wealth has been funneled through \u201cphilanthropic\u201d organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation. Contributions and funding from the Rockefeller Foundation may look good on the surface, however, the control that comes from it is vast. For example, the current medical model originated with the Rockefeller\u2019s around the turn of the century. In the early 1900\u2019s, John D. Rockefeller set up the Institute for Medical Research that laid the foundation for health research and development. Then in 1913, the Rockefeller Foundation became one of the largest funders of medical research. They hand-picked scientists and doctors who were considered worthy of funding, with a heavy emphasis on pharmacology. This drug-treatment paradigm was carried over into the universities, many of which are still funded or were initially established by the Rockefeller Foundation. In this way, drug-based medical care has become the norm. It\u2019s a similar story in all other sectors, which you can track in the \u201cFollow the Money\u201d section of the site.

In banking, the Rockefeller\u2019s have had an ownership stake in Chase ever since 1930, when they merged the Rockefeller-owned Equitable Trust Company of New York with Chase National Bank. In the 1970s and 1980s Chase Manhattan was run by David Rockefeller. Then Chase Manhattan merged with J.P. Morgan and Co. in 2000. \n\n\"For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\" \n\n- David Rockefeller, Memoirs, 2002 \"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the NY Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promise of discretion for almost forty years\u2026 It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supernational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.\"\n\n\u2013 David Rockefeller at a meeting in June of 1991 of the Bilderberg Group in Baden Baden, Germany. \n\n The Morgans \u2013 J.P. Morgan was the front-man for the Rothschilds around the turn of the century. He has a history of profiting from crises, as detailed in the timeline above. In both banking panics of 1893 and 1907, he intervened creating the illusion of economic stability while consolidating wealth for his company. J.P. Morgan also benefitted from the Great Depression. When \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d hit in 1929 he bought up cheap stocks to \u201ckeep the economy afloat.\u201d While people endured extreme hardship, J.P. Morgan walked away with significant financial gains. Today Morgan\u2019s strategy lives on in Chase and CitiGroup. I believe these banking powerhouses were largely responsible for the most recent economic collapse. They were well aware of their destructive behavior but did nothing to stop it. In the end these banks were bailed out by taxpayer debt and gained huge profits while their competitors went under and people lost their homes, jobs, and retirement funds. I am convinced this was no accident \u2013 it was an intentional power and money grab that has happened throughout the course of history. \"Fifty men have run America, and that's a high figure.\"\n\n- Joseph Kennedy, father of JFK, in the July 26th, l936 issue of The New York Times \"...when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people... will hate the new world order... and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.\"\n\n- H. G. Wells, in his book entitled The New World Order (1939) \"The government of the Western nations, whether monarchical or republican, had passed into the invisible hands of a plutocracy, international in power and grasp. It was, I venture to suggest, this semi-occult power which... pushed the mass of the American people into the cauldron of World War I.\"\n\n- British military historian Major General J.F.C. Fuller, l941 \"The real rulers in Washington are invisible, and exercise power from behind the scenes.\"\n\n- Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, 1952 \"Today the path of total dictatorship in the United States can be laid by strictly legal means (just as they where in Nazi Germany), unseen and unheard by the Congress, the President, or the people. Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system, another body representing another form of government \u2013 a bureaucratic elite.\"\n\n- Senator William Jenner, 1954\n\nHOW is the Agenda Implemented? Citizens wouldn\u2019t simply stand by and let others take control of their lives, unless it was concealed in some way. Part of the shrewdness behind the agenda is that it is disguised so well that people even contribute to their own demise without knowing it. Most of us end up craving more credit and accepting more taxes to bail out those who are robbing us in the first place. We are giving our money to these elite controllers every time we make a deposit in one of their banks. They have convinced us that not only do we need them, but also that what\u2019s good for them is good for us, and nothing could be further from the truth. Catherine Austin Fitts describes this as a \u201ctapeworm economy.\u201d The global elite also utilize and sometimes manufacture tragic events to further their control. They do this either through a strategy referred to as \u201cProblem-Reaction-Solution,\u201d the \u201cStrategy of Tension\u201d or the \u201cShock Doctrine,\u201d or False Flag Operations. Problem-Reaction-Solution goes something like this: (3) Implement an already prepared, and previously unacceptable \u201csolution\u201d that further centralizes control. Another deceptive strategy for consolidating power is \u201cFalse Flag\u201d Operations \u2013 named after the old technique of attacking a group using an enemy\u2019s banner instead of ones\u2019 own to misdirect the ensuing counterattack. These manufactured and often tragic events allow the elite to acquire resources, reap profit from wars, and erode our rights. They are disguised to generate a predictable reaction \u2013 public fear \u2013 to help serve the controlling interests. Some examples include: World War I \u2013 this war was ignited by a fake terror assassination event of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. The Lusitania \u2013 in 1915 was sailed into hostile waters with armaments from the Morgan banking interests hidden in the hold of the passenger ship.[3] The subsequent sinking by German U boats and the loss of thousands of lives was apparently used to awake the anger of the American people to get them into the War. An intentionally set fire in the German Reichstag building in 1933 enabled the Nazis to set up \u201cemergency laws\u201d as a \u201ccrackdown on terrorism\u201d and justify the police state. World War II \u2013 started around a staged attack by the Germans on one of their own radio stations \u2013 which they then blamed on the Poles. There is documented proof that President Franklin Roosevelt knew from decoded Japanese messages, that they were planning to attack Pearl Harbor, but he kept it secret in order to get them to \u201cfire the first shot,\u201d because that would motivate the American population to get into the War in Europe.[4] Operation Northwoods \u2013 in 1962 was a covert CIA operation (now unclassified and fully documented) to paint a plane with Red Cross colors, shoot it down and blame Castro, so the US would have an excuse to invade Cuba. President Kennedy refused to go along with the plan. Vietnam War - Gulf of Tonkin \u2013 Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara acknowledged that the attack of a ship in the Gulf of Tonkin, which was the catalyst for the US entry into the Viet Nam War, actually never happened. 9/11 \u2013 The evidence is vast and growing of complicity by some individuals within the US Government and financial sector in the attacks of September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon. Architects, engineers, physicists, whistle blowers, investigative reporters and filmmakers are all behind a growing 9/11 truth movement (see Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth). \n\n \u201c...the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.\"\n\n- Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials \u201cThe individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous, he cannot believe it exists.\"\n\n- J. Edgar Hoover\n\nThe notion of intentional depopulation is difficult to consider. I wrestled with whether to include it in the film and on this site. I am taking the risk of discussing it because I believe that we will not be sufficiently astute in our assessment of what is going on until we allow for the possibility of this perverse reality. Food and water additives, aerial spraying, contaminated vaccines, man-made weather catastrophes through HAARP, and endless wars look different through the lens of depopulation, and the dangers \u2013 and our responses to them \u2013 can become more informed and leveraged when we dare to face the documented evidence that exists beneath the lies we are told. See the Resource Tree at the bottom of this page for books and links to facilitate your own inquiry. Eugenics and de-population programs were initiated by powerful families including the Rockefellers, Carnegies and Harrimans at the beginning of the 20th century. Their work inspired later dictators like Adolph Hitler to cull undesirable portions of the populace.[5] We have been schooled to focus on Hitler as a unique madman who somehow got control of a whole nation by himself, but as is usually the case, it is well documented that Hitler was himself a puppet figure for the international banking cabal that wanted to overthrow Stalin.[6] The genocidal agenda of the Nazis was forced underground after the defeat of the Germans and their convictions at the Nuremburg trials, but a similar agenda is re-surfacing all around the world in less obvious forms of aggressive elimination of large numbers of people.[7] In fact, many Nazi rocket scientist and mind control experimenters were brought to America under a covert CIA program called Operation Paperclip.[8] The anonymously created Georgia Guidestones in Elbert County, Georgia, USA, have enshrined the idea that 500 million people is the number that the Earth can sustain.[9] What methods might the elite be using to involuntarily get rid of people? My research leads me to believe that the vast amount of illness, sterility and death due to the following human created afflictions is no accident:\n\u2022 in our atmosphere (See Environment Critical Issue section on HAARP)\n\u2022 man-made weather catastrophes, earthquakes and volcanos and tsunamis (See Environment Critical Issue section on HAARP)\n\u2022 in our bodies and in our waterways\n\u2022 like the Swine Flu, Lyme Disease (Lab 257. Carroll, Michael C.) and AIDS (DNA: Pirates of the Sacred Spiral, Horowitz, Dr. Leonard)\n\u2022 like the anti-tetanus one laced with B-hCG, which when given in a vaccine, undermines women\u2019s ability to sustain a pregnancy. The whistle has been blown on this type of covert sterilization in Mexico, the Phillipines, Puerto Rico and various countries in Africa. The dissemination of this vaccine was initiated by the Rockefeller founded Population Council and promoted through UNICEF, with funding from organizations like the Gates Foundation (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VG4WibFBPs) and Procter & Gamble (http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message760430/pg1). The tragic irony, to me, is that evidence is strong that populations tend to stabilize when they have access to prosperity and education, not when they are undermined or attacked. \n\n \u201cDiet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible. Even if all are miserable, all will believe themselves happy, because the government will tell them that they are so.\u201d \u2013 p62 \u201cGradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species. A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton. (The Aztecs kept a domesticated alien tribe for the purposes of cannibalism. Their regime was totalitarian)\u201d \u2013 p63 \"At present the population of the world is increasing ... War so far has had no great effect on this increase ... I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others ... If a Black Death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full ... the state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant, but what of it? Really high-minded people are indifferent to suffering, especially that of other peoples. Here are three ways of securing a society that shall be stable as regards population. The first is that of birth control, the second that of infanticide or really destructive wars, and the third that of general misery except for a powerful minority\u2026\u201d p18\n\n - Bertrand Russell \u2013 The Impact of Science on Society, 1953\n\n \"...we are in the process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist to get people to love their servitude.\" \"...there is evidently a whole class of drugs effecting the CNS [central nervous system] which can produce enormous changes in sedation in euphoria in energizing the whole mental process without doing any perceptible harm to the human body, and this presents to me the most extraordinary revolution. In the hands of a dictator these substances in one kind or the other could be used with, first of all, complete harmlessness, and the result would be, you can imagine a euphoric that would make people thoroughly happy even in the most abominable circumstances.draft of their \u2018Global Biodiversity Assessment\u2018 states there must be a reduction of five billion people.\"\n\n - Julian Huxley, Berkeley, 1962 \"...we have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3 of its population... In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and daydreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives. We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world benefaction...? We should stop putting ourselves in the position of being our brothers' keeper and refrain from offering moral and ideological advice. We should cease to talk about vague ... unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.\"\n\n - George Kennan, Top Secret Memo PPS23 to the Secretary of State, 1948 In \"The First Global Revolution,\" published by The Council of the Club of Rome, an international elitist organization, the authors note that: \"In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention ...The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.\" 16\n\n - The First Global Revolution, Club of Rome, 1991 \u201cInaction today could mean that more drastic steps, less compatible with individual choice and freedom, will seem necessary tomorrow to slow population growth.\u201d\n\nWorld Bank 1984 World Development Report \u201c...whereas death control is extremely easy under modern circumstances, birth control is extremely difficult. The reason is very simple: death control \u2013 the control, for example, of infectious diseases \u2013 can be accomplished by a handful of experts and quite a small labour force of unskilled persons and requires a very small capital expenditure.\u201d\n\n - Aldous Huxley, 1959 \u201cU.S. policy toward the third world should be one of depopulation\u201d\n\n - Henry Kissinger, 1978 For an in-depth history of Eugenics and the agenda for de-population, see the film, Endgame, by Alex Jones.\n\nCommon Objections to the Notion of Conspiracy Government is too incompetent to pull off such a vast conspiracy and keep it secret.\n\n As portrayed in THRIVE, the key to keeping secret an agenda as massive as what I am describing is a \u201cpyramid\u201d structure, a \u201cneed to know\u201d system, where people only understand as much as they need to do accomplish their tasks, but no more. That way only the individuals at the top of each pyramid know the full plan. This is the way it works in the secret societies, the CIA, the banks, the major corporations, the military, the media and on and on. Most people involved in fulfilling the Global Domination Agenda would be horrified if they actually understood what they are inadvertently contributing to. Just such a compartmentalized apparatus was what allowed the US\u2019s Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb in secret despite having 130,000 people working on it. \u201cThe great masses of people will more easily fall prey to a big lie than a small one... Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it...\u201d\n\n- Adolf Hitler At the top of the Follow the Money pyramid, above even the Bank of International Settlements are the so-called Secret Societies. They are called such because there is little or no information that comes out revealing what got said, done or decided behind closed doors. No press is allowed. Their members are not allowed to take notes, and are sworn to absolute secrecy \u2013 often under penalty of death. If the Bilderbergers, the Trilateral Commission, the Masons, the Priory of Scion, the Council on Foreign Relations, Skull & Bones, the Illuminati, the Committee of 300, The White Brotherhood, the Black Nobility and so many others are really working for the good of all mankind, wouldn\u2019t it be appropriate to see a live feed on TV or the Internet of their discussions and highest level decision making? (See Jim Marrs\u2019 Rule by Secrecy and The Rise of the Fourth Reich, and The Secret Behind Secret Societies, Jon Rapaport, Secret Societies... And How the Affect Our Lives Today by Sylvia Brown) So what is being kept so secret? My research has shown me that the main things having to be kept from public view throughout history have to do with corruption of money, power and sex. The most renowned groups seem to meet to allocate money and influence to consolidate power for their own benefit \u2013 ultimately feeding the agenda for themselves to rule the world and to keep the rest of the people at bay. The roster and timing of known meetings shows a consistent pattern of this (Jim Tucker\u2019s Bilderberg Diary) and occasional leaked information confirms it. The attendees are the people at the top of the pyramids of banking, media, military, intelligence, government, education, corporations and organized religion \u2013 or their agents. When they come out of their meetings, an experienced eye can begin to see the desired stories, candidates, market moves, coups, wars etc. appearing through the tentacles of the networks they command. But aren\u2019t the Terrorists really out to get us because of our freedom? With no actual threatening enemy to justify their vast military appropriations and imperialist wars, the would-be controllers have created the bogey-man of \u201cterrorism\u201d instead. Terrorism is not a person, a group or a nation. It is a tactic. When I have \"followed the money\u201d upstream behind so-called acts of terrorism, what I have found, virtually always, is blow-back from violent aggression \u2013 victimized peoples trying to protect themselves from the invasion of their sovereign nations, the destruction of their cultures and economies, and the killing of innocent people. In thinking critically, I believe it is vital to consider what is really going on to motivate people to desperate acts \u2013 and I certainly don\u2019t see any evidence it is that they \u201chate our freedom.\u201d It\u2019s worth pondering if the perpetrators of the greatest terrorizing aren\u2019t actually the \u201cshock and awe\u201d controllers themselves. The world is too big to rule, too complicated to dominate. And besides, if they were trying, we would know about it. In trying to assess whether or not such a shocking and dangerous conspiracy as the \u201cGDA\u201d could actually be true, I forced myself to think like a would-be controller and figure out what I would need to take over in order to have a shot at dominating the lives of everyone, everywhere. This was an immensely unpleasant, but profoundly informative and useful process. I realized they would have to try to take complete control over: money, energy, food and water, health, education, media, justice, science, religion, the arts and even the weather. They would have to sicken us, dumb us down, track our every move, hack our voting, steep us in debt and keep us afraid. Unfortunately, as you can read in the various Sectors of this site, that is exactly what they have done...But not entirely. Fortunately, as of this writing, the elite have not been able to take over the Internet in the western nations and there are a vast number of brilliant computer whizzes out there who have organized to keep that from happening. They have not completely taken over food or health supplements, though their GMO and Codex Alimentarius efforts are vigorous. Such initiatives as organic growing, homeschooling, indy media, alternative currency, holistic health and the \u201cOccupy\u201d movements are booming. Author Naomi Wolf, in The End of America, has researched and outlined the 10 key indicators of when a country is slipping into fascist control. See if these sound hauntingly familiar: 9) Cast Criticism as \u201cEspionage\u201d and Dissent as \u201cTreason\u201d \"When you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing; when you see that money is flowing to those who deal not in goods, but in favors; when you see that men get rich more easily by graft than by work, and your laws no longer protect you against them, but protect them against you\u2026 you may know that your society is doomed.\"\n\n\u2013Ayn Rand, novelist & philosopher, author of Atlas Shrugged Author Naomi Klein, in her article China\u2019s All-Seeing Eye, reveals how the Chinese system so admired by David Rockefeller has created a \u201cmodel city\u201d of the future that gives a chilling vision of where the elite would like to take us. In just 30 years, Shenzen has grown from empty terrain to 21.4 million occupants who are continually subjected to \u201ccentral planning, merciless repression and constant surveillance.\u201d There are-already over 200,000 cameras in place with 2 million planned. The latest people tracking technologies are a part of \u201cGolden Shield,\u201d a high-tech surveillance and censorship program, and are supplied by the likes of IBM, Honeywell, and GE to create and test a \u201cpolice state 2.0\u201d on a scale that would still be resisted in America. If we could just get rid of weapons we could live in a safe world. As thoroughly committed as I am to non-aggression and even to non-violent self-defense (see Aikido) whenever possible, that does not mean I would stand by and see someone raped or let someone hurt me or another or take their rightfully gained property. America has a history of armed revolt in the face of tyranny. Statistically in America there are about 9 guns for every 10 adults. Throughout history, when a would be dictator has plans to take over a people, one of the first actions planned is \u201cdisarmament.\u201d Always for good sounding reasons of course \u2013 such as \u201cfor a more peace-loving secure world.\u201d Not only was this true in Germany (1938), Italy and China (1935), but also in Turkey (1911), the Soviet Union (1929), Guatemala (1964), Uganda (1970), and Cambodia (1956). But the outcome is always the same: the state and the crooks keep the weapons and the ensuing police state meets much less resistance.\n\n Australia in 2008 forced gun owners to surrender 640,381 personal firearms for destruction, at a cost of more than $500 million to the taxpayer. In a year, with criminals more confident their victims would be unarmed, homicides were up 6.2%. Assaults were up 9.6%. Robberies were up 44%. It\u2019s been said that, \u201cDemocracy is two wolves and a lamb deciding what\u2019s for dinner... and Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.\u201d If there were a hidden agenda to rule the world, we could just get rid of those in charge to stop it. It\u2019s the Agenda, Not Any One Person It is critical to realize that the Global Domination Agenda is not dependent on any one person or small group for its survival. It is a worldview institutionalized in man-made laws, kept in place by bribes and threats. It has become in some ways a \u201clegal mafia\u201d because violations of contract integrity, persons and property have been OK\u2019d by legislation. Just a few examples are: fraud and embezzlement (fiat money, swaps, short sales, derivatives, subsidies, bailouts, corporate personhood, etc.) theft (involuntary taxation, eminent domain land seizures), kidnapping (military draft, extraordinary rendition, Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act...), assault (mandatory vaccines, mandatory pesticide sprays, covert Chemtrails spraying, sobriety checkpoints...) torture (\u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d) So it is the moral basis and transparency of all systems that must be transformed, and no system can be imposed except in true self-defense. \u201cThey who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\u201d\n\n- Benjamin Franklin \n\n For me the role of sexual abuse in this domination scheme is the bottom of the bottom, the most repulsive part of the underbelly of what gets discovered as one continues to follow the threads of money and power. My research has convinced me that pedophilia and even Satanic rituals are an integral part of the lives of many of the perpetrators of this agenda and is a part of the mind-control system that operates in their covert plan for domination. This information is not critical for understanding that there is a global domination agenda or what we can do to achieve true liberty. I include it because I believe it is true and reveals the level of disturbing perversion that underlies the psyche of those in positions of vast power and the role of mind control (such as MK Ultra) that is involved in carrying out their agenda. I suggest you pursue it only at the pace that works for you to integrate such a disturbing realization into the larger picture of the vast love and awakening that is emerging at this time on our planet.

As horrifying as it is to think what is being done to so many of the most defenseless among us, it was important for me to come to the realization that many of these same controllers who seek to abuse children are also running the major power centers of the world. Few of us get up in the morning thinking how we can cause pain and suffering for others, but some do. And their psychopathic or sociopathic capabilities to dissociate from human suffering actually tend to be rewarded in the system of lies and deceptions that is our political and financial structure. Recognizing that there are individuals whose psyches have been distorted into destructive patterns like this makes it even more imperative not to have a monopoly on money creation and a monopoly on force like the current bankster-run state. In his scientific exploration, Political Ponerology, Andrew Lobaczewski traces the backgrounds of prominent figures whose sociopathic personalities have led to the deaths of millions. It is critical to understand that not only are there those who long to do harm to individuals and the masses, but their lack of moral values, integrity and compassion is rewarded in the corrupt power structures of today. Recognizing that there are individuals whose psyches have been distorted into destructive patterns like this makes it even more imperative not to have a monopoly on money creation and a monopoly on force like the current bankster-run state. Nobody would do such a thing. Just because most of the people we know would not harm anyone on purpose, it doesn\u2019t mean there are not those who could, would and choose to on a regular basis. These are people who have disassociated from normal human feelings to where they can knowingly run millions out of their jobs and homes, have hundreds of thousands killed in unnecessary and illegitimate wars and sicken intentionally countless others \u2013 and justify it with a worldview that says they know best, they have a special right to rule and that they are making a better world for the chosen by their cruelty to the many. \u201cPower is the ultimate aphrodisiac.\u201d\n\n- Henry Kissinger, New York Times, Oct 28, 1973", "opengraph": {"title": "Global Domination Agenda", "type": "cause", "url": "https://www.thrivemovement.com/views/the_problem-gda", "image": "http://www.thrivemovement.com/images/poster_thumbnail.jpg", "site_name": "The Problem / Global Domination Agenda - A small group of financial elite have gained control over key areas of our lives  | Thrive", "description": "A small group of financial elite have gained control over key areas of our lives \u2013 energy, food, health care, education and more \u2013 and are the single greatest threat to humanity\u2019s ability to thrive.
