Set in the context of the American presence in Korea after World War II, the film reveals horrible atrocities at the hands of the U.S. Military Government of Korea.\n\nRegis currently lives in Yalta, Russia, on the Crimean Peninsula. His YouTube channel was deleted despite having 16,000 subscribers, hundreds of thousands of views, and mountains of video footage telling the story of Donbas. You can now find him at the following links:\n\nI will also be uploading some of Regis videos from his international association, \u201cFriends of Crimea \u2014 Friends of Russia,\u201d which I have also joined.\n\nIf you are not already familiar with Regis Tremblay and his Global Conversations, I highly recommend them!\n\nHere is my interview with Regis.\n\nSince we do not trust Google (YouTube) to keep these invaluable videos around (they deleted Regis' account along with his video library) we are offering here the BitChute version of this interview. \n\n\n\n\n\n Deborah Armstrong, long-time TV and print journalist and Friend of Russia - Friend of Crimea tells of her year and a half in the Soviet Union working for Soviet national television.
