Though most of us are concerned about our waistlines during this time of year, your weight should be the least of your worries. High refined sugar intake has always had a strong correlation to tumor development in cancer patients, but now there is evidence suggests that a high sugar diet can actually cause cancer.\n\nCancer cells uptake sugar at 10-12 times the rate of healthy cells. The Positron Emission Tomography is one of the most accurate tools for measuring cancer growth. The 1931 Nobel laureate in medicine, German Otto Warburg developed a hypothesis that cancer cells have a different energy metabolism compared to healthy cells. Malignant tumors, according to Warburg, exhibit increased glycolysis in contrast to healthy human cells.\n\nThe 2013-2014 Journal of Clinic Investigation released the results of an in vitro study that analyzed the results of increased sugar uptake and oncogenesis (cancer creation). The results demonstrated that increased glucose uptake had a direct and positive correlation to the early phases of cancer cell production.\n\nOne of the crucial mechanisms through which cancer is promoted through sugar is through mitochondrial dysfunction. Sugar burns very differently than fat does, which generates free radicals. When free radicals damage the mitochondria of the cell, the nuclear DNA, and cell membrane are also affected, leading to protein impairment.\n\nCancer is essentially caused by the replication of genetically mutated cells. Mitosis is the means through which cells divide and promote tissue growth. When the process of apoptosis (cell death) begins to break down, cancer occurs.\n\nObesity and chronic overeating have had a positive correlation and causation to the growth and development of cancer cells. According to the Canadian Cancer Society, being obese can cause changes in hormone levels, such as sex hormones or insulin, which increase the risk of developing breast, colon or uterine cancer.\n\nThe study takes into account the difference between refined sugar and naturally occurring sugars. Refined sugars include table sugar and high fructose corn syrup that are absorbed by the body when consuming processed foods, sodas, and baked desserts, namely added sugar. Naturally occurring sugars in fruits are deemed less harmful, regardless of their glycemic index.\n\nMoreover, a 1985 study on sugar and the risk of large bowel cancer found that patients with high intakes of sugar were more predisposed to the development of cancer than patients with lower intakes of sugar. A prospective study published in 2006 found that high consumption of sugar and high-sugar foods were linked to a greater risk of pancreatic cancer, and a different study showed similar results for breast cancer patients.\n\nDr. Tony Jimenez hypothesizes that sugar from organic produce may not contribute to cancer cell growth in the same way refined sugars do because human cells absorb left-spinning molecules, which occur in fruits and vegetables, while cancer cells can only absorb right spinning particles, which come from refined sugar.\n\nWhat You Should Do\n\nSugar has been related to a multitude of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, immobility, elevated triglycerides and high blood pressure. Cutting out refined sugars from soda and processed foods is a good start to decreasing your risk of cancer cell growth, as well as those other conditions.\n\nConsume your daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables. Ensure you are getting enough fiber, iron, and protein in your diet. Do not drink fruit juices that have added sugar, and use natural sweeteners such as honey or stevia, and avoid high-fructose corn syrup and genetically modified sugar or sugar replacement such as aspartame.\n\nEat the right amount of sugar: for women, have no more than six teaspoons (25 grams) of sugar each day, for men, have no more than nine teaspoons per day (37 grams); this equals to 100 calories for women and 150 for men. The majority of people in America eat over double that amount, averaging at around 22 teaspoons per day.\n\nHidden sugars: fructose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, glucose, and dextrose are all forms of sugar you can find on the Nutritional Facts label on the back of your next meal.\n\nOther natural sugars: Molasses, agave nectar, honey and maple syrup are natural sugars and contain antioxidants that can protect your body from cancer. But consume these in moderation, as they contain the same amount of calories as any other kind of sweetener.\n\nDid you know the U.S. spends more than $1 trillion each year fighting the damaging health effects of sugar, which includes obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Obesity is responsible for approximately 500,000 cancer diagnoses worldwide each year, and both sugar and overeating in general cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which can lead to DNA damage and result in cancer. In fact, one of the most powerful strategies we know of to avoid and/or treat cancer is to starve the cancer cells by depriving them of their food source, which is primarily sugar and excessive protein. Unlike all the other cells in your body, which can burn carbs or fat for fuel, cancer cells have lost that metabolic flexibility and can only thrive if there enough sugar present. German cancer researcher Dr. Otto Warburg was actually given a Nobel Prize in 1931 for discovering this. Clearly, the health benefits from cutting refined sugars out of your diet should far outweigh the craving for foods made with processed sugar, and the good news is the less you eat it, the less you want it.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sugar Feeds and Produces Cancer Cells", "description": "Halloween and the holiday season are approaching.
