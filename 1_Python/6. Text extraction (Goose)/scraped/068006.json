The paper said that while \"numerous\" cases of encephalitis \"have been reported in connection with the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines,\" this was \"the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein within the encephalitic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection.\" Dr Michael M\u00f6rz, a researcher in Pathology at Hospital Dresden-Friedrichstadt, in Germany, wrote that the family of a 76-year-old patient with Parkinson's Disease, who died three weeks after receiving his third Covid-19 vaccination, had \"requested an autopsy due to ambiguous clinical signs before death.\" The patient was first vaccinated in May 2021 with the Astra Zeneca vector vaccine, followed by two doses of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine in July and December 2021.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://gript.ie/autopsy-suggests-link-between-covid-19-vaccine-and-encephalitis-in-brain/", "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/10/1651"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
