But here\u2019s the crazy thing\u2026\n\nMy appearance on national TV really pissed off some people. And no \u2013 not because it was on CNN. (My stance on national media has always been to take the opportunity to spread the truth, no matter what outlet).\n\nSo why would anyone be enraged that I went on TV to talk about lettuce?\n\nThere are a band of food industry people who follow my every move and do whatever they can to bring our movement down. This includes people who work with Big Food and chemical corporations and public relations firms who represent these companies. They don\u2019t want an activist like me to have an audience and to tell people the truth about our food supply. This threatens their profits\u2026 and when you are a threat, you become a target. It can be scary at times, but I do my best to not let it sway me.\n\nSo after my appearance on CNN last weekend, I found myself again being targeted with a tactic called \u201castroturfing\u201d. This is something they have done to me in the past, often after I make a big public appearance or launch a successful campaign or petition.\n\nAstroturfing is a fake grassroots movement, which is used to make it look like there is either widespread support or disapproval of a person, issue, or company \u2013 even if there is not.\n\nWhen an astroturf campaign is launched, it will look like there are swarms of people on one side of the issue, when in all actuality, it is a small group of people working together backed by public relations firms or special interest groups. Astroturfing is designed to shape and distort media messages to fit a industry-friendly narrative and manipulate public opinion.\n\nFor instance, when we petition a Big Food company and ask them to drop a harmful additive from their food, hundreds of social media profiles (some real, some fake) are activated and flood Facebook with messages in opposition to what we are asking the company to do. When we asked In-N-Out Burger to stop the routine use of antibiotics, several profiles came to In-N-Out\u2019s Facebook Page and told them specifically not to change and not to listen us \u201cfear mongers.\u201d The same happened when we wrote about the risky additives in Boar\u2019s Head deli meats and asked them to improve.\n\nAstroturfing also happens behind the scenes and off of the pages of social media. When I am invited to speak at events, a swarm of social media profiles spam the organization who invited me to speak. When I was on the cover of Experience Life magazine and when Yahoo Health featured me in some videos, they tracked down the editors of these publications and swamped them with complaints. It appeared on the surface that the complaints were coming from dozens of separate individuals, but it was actually a small group of people working together to make it appear that way.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following me for awhile, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen astroturfing in action\u2026\n\nAfter you\u2019ve seen it a few times, it becomes glaringly obvious.\n\nAstroturfing is effective because it diverts attention away from the REAL ISSUES.\n\nIt encourages people to talk smack about a person \u2013 like Dr. Oz is a \u201cquack\u201d and Food Babe is a \u201cfearmonger\u201d \u2013 versus the real issues of having Roundup weedkiller in our food and artificial dyes in our mac n\u2019 cheese. They fear an honest discussion with what\u2019s wrong with these chemicals in our food.\n\nTo show you what I\u2019m up against, this is what happened after I was on national TV this week\u2026\n\nAn astroturfing campaign was kicked off by a woman who calls herself \u201cFarm Babe\u201d (wonder where she came up with that name?!). She is a conventional farmer who has worked as a \u201csocial media influencer\u201d for Domino\u2019s Pizza, Arctic Apples (GMO), Tyson Foods, and Elanco (maker of livestock drugs). She writes a regular column in Ag Daily \u2013 a publication backed by Monsanto and Bayer. Numerous makers of conventional farm feed and GMOs have hired her to speak at their events. She is literally working directly with Big Food and Ag brands. She also has a personal stake in the industry. On her farm she grows corn, soybeans, alfalfa and raises conventional beef on a feedlot that uses grains and growth hormones.\n\nShe works with many of the big players in Ag who are proponents of factory farming \u2013 something I want to change \u2013 so of course, she does not like what I stand for. So it was no surprise that she posted this on her Facebook page after my appearance on CNN:\n\nI\u2019ll address her comments about sewage sludge and antibiotics, but as you see below, her post engaged a swarm of people to send emails to CNN to complain about me and tell them to never have me on their network. Here are just a handful of responses to her post:\n\nAs you can see \u2013 there were swarms of people contacting CNN about my appearance.\n\nAfter Farm Babe launched this astroturf attack, a science writer at The Daily Beast caught on\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t know exactly how she got wind of it \u2013 but if I was a betting woman (and in this case, I would love to take a bet if I someone is daring enough to come forward to tell the truth about what happened here) \u2013 I would bet she was tipped off by Farm Babe herself or other industry-aligned people with an agenda.\n\nThe journalist Tanya Basu tried to fact check what I said \u2013 but instead FAILED miserably\u2026\n\nIn fact she completely disregarded what I said and made up a narrative that suited the FDA\u2019s response.\n\nOn CNN, I said I choose whole heads of lettuce (over bagged cut lettuce) because there are fewer points of potential contamination. I also made it clear that this wouldn\u2019t always eliminate the risk and that you cannot wash E. coli off of contaminated lettuce.\n\nI said I like to minimize the touch points in the supply chain when I make food choices. The less processing a product goes through, the better. And this isn\u2019t wrong \u2013 especially when it comes to lettuce.\n\nLettuce is known to be particularly tricky when it comes to food safety as everything ranging from \u201cproduction practices, harvesting, packing, processing and food handling have all been linked to illnesses associated with leafy greens. E. coli can get into food through manure, contaminated water used during growing or harvesting, or improper food handling at a store, restaurant or home\u201d. Buying a whole head of lettuce does minimize these touch points.\n\nShe went on to state that some scientists have said my \u201chatred of additives\u201d is rooted in \u201canti-science\u201d and \u201cperpetuates myths\u201d. To back up this statement, she quotes Kevin Folta criticizing our successful campaign to remove azodicarbonamide from Subway\u2019s bread. It is irresponsible that she uses this argument for two reasons. One \u2013 scientists do back up the fact that azodicarbonamide breaks down into carcinogens when baked. Secondly \u2013 Kevin Folta was the scientist quoted who is a known shill for the chemical industry.\n\nAlso, I am correct in stating that the overuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that can\u2019t be treated with antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization, \u201cThe high volume of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, particularly in settings of intensive animal production\u2026 Many of the bacteria (such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli) carried by animals can also cause disease in people. These bacteria, which are frequently antimicrobial-resistant, can contaminate our food supply from farm to fork, such as through slaughtering and processing. Fruits and vegetables may also be contaminated by such bacteria at the farm or later through cross-contamination.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, they try to mince my words on purpose to try to destroy my credibility.\n\nWhat a journalistic fail on this writers fault. She does a real disservice to public safety by spending her time attacking me.\n\nThey want me to be scared and go away\u2026\n\nThey want to control the narrative \u2013 so that everything you see on TV, in the news, on billboards, and on food packages is pro-processed food, pro-chemical, pro-Big Ag, and pro-Big Food.\n\nI refuse to let them silence me. I will not back down from telling people who will listen what I know. And plenty of people are listening. And this is WHY I wrote my new book Feeding You Lies.\n\nI know these types of attacks will be ramping up as this book is hitting stores in a few short months. In the book, I go into greater detail on the many different ways the industry pulls stunts to fool the public (and the media). It\u2019s eye-opening and you need to know what\u2019s going on!\n\nPlease pre-order a copy of Feeding You Lies to show the food industry that you support the work I am doing. Pick up a couple extras for your loved ones, it makes a great gift!\n\nI need every single one of you by my side.\n\nThe best way to make astroturfing less effective is to tell everyone about it! Please share this post.\n\nP.S.
