I\u2019d always wanted to write about a string quartet, but I didn\u2019t know what the anchor of the story would be. It wasn\u2019t until I landed on the Brit and Daniel relationship that I saw, Okay, this is a love story. I felt comfortable with that. And then as I wrote, I slowly realized, Oh, this whole thing is a love story. You have to fall into a kind of love with people you work with in this way, as long-term artistic collaborators. That\u2019s when the book really took off. What was it like being a competitive musician growing up? Honestly, horrible! I hated that part of it. I wasn\u2019t good at competing. I choked. I loved playing by myself or playing in a group. But I always psyched myself out and panicked at competitions or auditions. That\u2019s part of what propelled me through The Ensemble\u2014I was writing about scenarios that terrified me. Putting these characters in high-stakes professional situations and matching that with personal-life drama kept the story alive for me as I figured it out. Did you have a playlist that you listened to while writing the book? I listened closely to all the pieces that feature in the book, and I made a Spotify playlist of them. But when I needed noise that wasn\u2019t a part of the book, I would listen to these Handel suites for keyboard by jazz pianist Keith Jarrett. They\u2019re so simple and mathematical that it was easy to tune in and out of them. Tell us about \u201cLittle Fish.\u201d \u201cLittle Fish\u201d! It\u2019s a short story I wrote a long time ago about a global pandemic that affects the population with memory loss. A feature film adaptation of it was made in early 2019, before COVID, and was released this past February. Though I had absolutely nothing to do with the film\u2019s production, I\u2019m super proud to be associated with it. Awesome script by Mattson Tomlin, tender direction by Chad Hartigan, and a truly incredible lead performance by Olivia Cooke. Rent it now! But have tissues ready. It\u2019s a sad one. Will you share some nail-art looks and inspiration? I\u2019m so glad you asked. @topknotnails and @asabree are incredible nail artists in Portland whom I love. Here in LA, I go to @nailsby_Kana, a Japanese nail artist who does really pretty and detailed work. As a freshly vaccinated person, I cannot wait to go back to her to get a manicure. Side note: Manicures became a part of my life only after I stopped playing cello, because I always had to keep my nails sooooo short to play. My first meal after I gave birth this past February was the spicy vodka fusilli and chocolate cake from Jon & Vinny\u2019s. But also: Suehiro in Little Tokyo for Japanese comfort food, like tonkatsu or donburi. The ricotta pancakes from Little Dom\u2019s. Burritos from El Zarape. A sandwich named after Terry Gross at Wax Paper. Shakshuka from Republique. The burger at All Time. I could go on. The food in LA is *chef\u2019s kiss*. What are your favorite books about friends? I will always and forever admire A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. The Group by Mary McCarthy is a must-read. And most recently, Sally Rooney\u2019s Conversations with Friends, the adaptation of which I am so excited to watch.\n\nDid you have a playlist that you listened to while writing the book?
