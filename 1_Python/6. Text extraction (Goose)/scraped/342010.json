A court in the Russian capital quickly ruled that the reporter should be kept in custody pending investigation. His arrest was the first time since the Cold War that an American journalist had been imprisoned over espionage allegations.\n\nThe FSB accused Gershkovich of attempting to obtain classified information, arguing that he \u201cwas acting on instructions from the American side to collect information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex that constitutes a state secret.\u201d It added that Gershkovich \u2013 who had previously worked for Agence France-Presse and the New York Times \u2013 had been accredited by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to work as a journalist.\n\nA fluent speaker of Russian, Gershkovich is a correspondent in the WSJ\u2018s Moscow bureau covering Russia, Ukraine and other countries in the former Soviet Union. If convicted, however, he can face up to 20 years behind bars.\n\nKremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters about Gershkovich\u2019s arrest: \u201cIt is not about a suspicion, it is about the fact that he was caught red-handed.\u201d MFA spokeswoman Maria Zhakarova, meanwhile, accused the WSJ reporter of using his credentials as a cover for \u201cactivities that have nothing to do with journalism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the WSJ denied the allegations against its Russia correspondent. \u201c[We seek] the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter,\u201d said the newspaper. \u201cWe stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.\u201d\n\nPrior to Gershkovich, U.S. News & World Report correspondent Nicholas Daniloff was arrested by the Committee on State Security (KGB) in 1996 over the same charges. The Soviet-era KGB was the predecessor of the FSB that arrested the WSJ reporter. Daniloff was later released without charge 20 days after his arrest, in exchange for a member of the Soviet Union\u2019s United Nations mission who was arrested by U.S. authorities for espionage.\n\nOver at the White House, the Biden administration said it has spoken with both the WSJ and Gershkovich\u2019s family. However, it clarified that it had no \u201cspecific indication\u201d that journalists in Russia were being targeted.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre condemned the arrest \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d and urged Americans to heed government warnings against traveling to Russia. She added that the U.S. Department of State was in direct touch with Moscow and seeking access to the jailed reporter.\n\nProminent Russian defense attorney Ivan Pavlov said of the incident: \u201cThat unwritten rule not to touch accredited foreign journalists has stopped working.\u201d He also pointed out that the case against Gershkovich was built to give Moscow \u201ctrump cards\u201d for a future prisoner exchange. Pavlov ultimately remarked that the case will likely be resolved \u201cnot by the means of the law, but by political [and] diplomatic means.\u201d\n\nJeanne Cavelier, head of Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk at press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said Gershkovich\u2019s arrest \u201clooks like a retaliation measure of Russia against the United States.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe are very alarmed because it is probably a way to intimidate all Western journalists that are trying to investigate aspects of the war on the ground in Russia.\u201d\n\nCorporate security executive and former Marine Paul Whelan has been in a similar predicament since 2018. He was arrested by Russian authorities that year over the same espionage charges, and has been imprisoned since. An opportunity to free him came in December 2021, but the Biden administration chose to exchange arms dealer Viktor Bout for basketball player Brittney Griner \u2013 who was arrested for drug possession. (Related: CLAIM: Biden released international arms dealer Viktor Bout to RECRUIT him to offload US weapons for slush fund cash controlled by Dems.)\n\n\u201cOur family is sorry to hear that another American family will have to experience the same trauma that we have had to endure for the past 1,553 days,\u201d David Whelan, Paul\u2019s brother, said in an emailed statement. \u201cIt sounds as though the frame-up of Gershkovich was the same as it was in Paul\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nVisit RussiaReport.news for more about Americans being arrested in Russia.\n\nWatch Harrison Smith discuss why arms dealer Viktor Bout was exchanged for Brittney Griner instead of Paul Whelan on \u201cThe American Journal.\u201d\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nChinese agents arrested for stalking and attempting to coerce Chinese dissidents into returning to China.\n\nEx-Twitter employee sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for serving as SPY for Saudi Arabia.", "opengraph": {"title": "Russia arrests WSJ reporter over alleged espionage charges", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2023-04-03-russia-arrests-wsj-report-over-espionage-charges.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "Russian authorities arrested a reporter from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) over charges of alleged espionage.
