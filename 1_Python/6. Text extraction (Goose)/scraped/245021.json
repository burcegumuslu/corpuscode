The vaccine, which is called VLA15, is the only Lyme disease vaccine for humans that\u2019s in clinical development.\n\nLyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It\u2019s transmitted to people through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Lyme disease symptoms can include fever, headache, fatigue, and a skin rash called erythema migrans, which creates a bulls-eye rash. If it\u2019s left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system, the CDC says.\n\nPfizer\u2019s vaccine is moving into a Phase 3 study and plans to enroll about 6,000 people ages five and up.\n\n\u201cWith increasing global rates of Lyme disease, providing a new option for people to help protect themselves from the disease is more important than ever,\u201d Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in a press release. \u201cWe hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 study will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date, and we are looking forward to collaborating with the research sites across the U.S. and Europe on this important trial.\"\n\nPhase 3 clinical trials are being held in 50 areas across the globe where Lyme disease is common, including the U.S., Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first vaccine for Lyme disease made available to the U.S.: There was a vaccine called LYMErix available in the U.S., but it was discontinued in 2002 due to \u201cinsufficient consumer demand,\u201d according to the CDC.\n\nHow does the Lyme disease vaccine VLA15 work?\n\nVLA15 is a three-dose vaccine given over five to nine months, followed by a booster dose a year later, according to Pfizer. \u201cSome vaccines take more to stimulate the immune system in a sufficiently secure way so you can get adequate protection,\u201d explains William Schaffner, M.D., infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \n\n\n\nThe vaccine targets the outer surface protein A of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, which is expressed by the bacteria in ticks. Blocking outer surface protein A keeps the bacteria from leaving the tick and infecting people, Pfizer explains. The vaccine covers the six most common types of outer surface protein A expressed by ticks in North America and Europe. \n\n\n\nWhat have the vaccine\u2019s clinical trial results shown so far?\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of information available about the vaccine data so far. Pfizer says that Phase 2 clinical trials \u201ccontinue to demonstrate strong immunogenicity in adults as well as in children, with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in both study populations.\u201d\n\nAccording to Valneva, which is making the vaccine with Pfizer, Phase 2 clinical trials followed 294 healthy adults who received either two or three doses of the vaccine. While both groups developed good immune responses, antibodies were higher in people who received the three-dose series. Similar results were found for study participants between the ages of five and 17, Valneva says.\n\nWhy do we need a Lyme disease vaccine?\n\nEach year, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the CDC, but the organization says this is likely an undercount. CDC estimates show that about 476,000 people in the U.S. may get Lyme disease each year.\n\n\u201cReturning a vaccine for Lyme disease to the U.S. market would be a major advance at controlling this endemic infection,\u201d says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cLyme disease exacts a significant burden on the population and the healthcare system and a vaccine could substantially lessen that burden.\u201d\n\nWilliam Schaffner, M.D., infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, calls the news \u201cvery exciting.\u201d He adds, \u201cmany people wish we had a Lyme disease vaccine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLyme disease is increasing in the U.S.\u2014and it\u2019s a very troublesome illness with lots of consequences,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. While Lyme disease is most common in New England and the upper Midwest, Dr. Schaffner points out that cases are spreading out of those areas.\n\nWhen will the Lyme disease vaccine be available?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear at this point. The vaccine still needs to get through Phase 3 clinical trials. If those go well, Pfizer says it plans to submit a license application to the FDA. But the FDA\u2019s timeline can vary and the vaccine would need to also be given the thumbs up from the CDC before it could be used by the general public. Depending on the timing of all of that, the vaccine could be available for use sometime in 2025 or 2026.\n\nWho will be able to get the Lyme disease vaccine?\n\nResearch on the Lyme disease vaccine is ongoing and Pfizer says it doesn\u2019t anticipate submitting a license application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) until 2025. Still, if and when it\u2019s available, \u201cindividuals who live in endemic areas of the U.S. would greatly benefit,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. Dr. Schaffner agrees, adding, \u201cone would anticipate it would be very popular.\u201d", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "A Lyme Disease Vaccine Is in Late-Stage Clinical Trials\u2014Here\u2019s What You Need to Know", "description": "Doctors say it's definitely needed.", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/row-of-medical-vials-and-syringe-glass-bottles-with-royalty-free-image-1660054127.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.245xh&resize=1200:*", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "600", "url": "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a40847285/lyme-disease-vaccine/", "article:section": "Health Conditions", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-10T12:30:12Z", "article:published_time": "2022-08-10T12:30:00Z", "types": ["article", "website"]}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html", "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21097669/lyme-disease-symptoms/", "https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-valneva-initiate-phase-3-study-lyme-disease", "https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/vaccine.html", "https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-valneva-initiate-phase-3-study-lyme-disease", "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a20063883/lyme-disease-faq/", "https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-and-pfizer-report-further-positive-phase-2-data-for-lyme-disease-vaccine-candidate/", "https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-and-pfizer-report-positive-phase-2-pediatric-data-for-lyme-disease-vaccine-candidate/", "https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Flyme%2Fstats%2Findex.html", "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a36685952/alec-baldwin-lyme-disease/", "https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/maps-recent.html", "https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-valneva-initiate-phase-3-study-lyme-disease", "/health/health-conditions/a21097669/lyme-disease-symptoms/", "/author/216238/korin-miller/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-10T12:30:00Z"}
