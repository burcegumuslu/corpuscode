This is commonly known as a vaccine! In other words, they take the dead virus (such as small pox) and inject it into your body in the form of a serum. Since the virus is dead, it doesn't hurt you. The dead virus cells cause your body's healthy cells to build up an immunity to that particular virus. Now you are safe from the virus. We should be thankful to the Lord for such medical advancements. Fifty years ago, many children died because of small pox. Today it is rare in this country.\n\nIn the same way, Christianity has been inoculated in this country. So-called Christian radio, and so-called Christian TV, and so-called Christian books have replaced our time alone with God. Very few believers spend quality time in prayer and Bible reading. They're too side-tracked reading other garbage. Many Believers have been inoculated from true Christianity because of all the so-called Christian literature and TV/radio shows that rob our time alone with God. If every Christian in this country would set aside the TV, books, radio and magazines (and instead spend that time praying and reading the Good Book)\u2014this nation would be transformed! It is sad that so many Believers never grow beyond what they hear on the radio, TV or read in a magazine.\n\nThis is the danger of the horde of religious books marketed to the public today, totally lacking the truth of what is important to God. You are not going to be much of a Christian if you don't spend time every day in prayer and the Word of God. We are at spiritual war in America, but you'd never know it from reading apostate books by Max Lucado, Joyce Meyer and Rick Warren.\n\nThere are good books available but you won\u2019t find them in your average so-called \"Christian\" bookstore.\n\nThis Scriptures make no mention of being a part-time Christian. We are ALL full-time workers in the Lord's fields. God's truth is not just for pastors or Sunday-school teachers. No, truth is for everyone. All of God\u2019s Children are supposed to delight themselves in the Law of the Lord and meditate upon God\u2019s Word day and night. The Bible is delightful to the Believer who is right with God! God\u2019s Word should be a lamp that is with us at all times. We are living in a nation where Christian people have built up an immunity (resistance) to prayer, Bible reading and soul-winning. It\u2019s difficult to find a Christian who still believes in door-to-door soul-winning.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me, I\u2019m not condemning good Christian books; however, much of the contemporary books written today have much to be desired of them. Only God\u2019s Word can adequately meet the Believers needs . Most of the so-called \"Christian\" radio and \"Christian\" TV programs are --they are worldly and ecumenical. \"Ecumenical\" meaning that they associate with wolves in sheep's clothing--like Catholicism. I used to like Jack Van Impe's ministry until he and his wife went pro-Catholic in 1995. It's just unbelievable! I'd like to hear someone on the radio speak the truth--that the Catholic religion is straight out of the pits of hell! Most Christians would be offended if Jesus or the Apostle Paul were to speak on the radio. Jesus would call sin by name and yell aloud against the evils of liquor, gambling and fornication. Then He would speak of God\u2019s love and preach the Gospel.\n\nTruly, the \"love of money\" is the root of all evil. Most so-called \"Christian\" publishers and \"Christian\" TV producers dip their sails in compromise to make more money. Most Christians have been \"inoculated.\" They listen to Christian words put to the devil\u2019s music and call it \u201cChristian rock.\u201d \"There ain\u2019t no such animal\"--Brother Lester Roloff. The words aren\u2019t very Christian either. The Devil has been vaccinating our churches against the old-time religion for years-- It\u2019s time for us to say \u201cno\u201d to a whole lot more than drugs, and say \u201cyes\u201d to Jesus and the Bible.\n\nI\u2019m not against Christian radio or TV, I\u2019m against believers neglecting their Bibles and prayer. Many people are making a lucrative fortune through TV and radio programs. I want to vomit every-time they try to sell me something. GET A BIBLE! That\u2019s all you need! We\u2019ve lost the old-time religion in this nation! I\u2019m not against good Christian books, but the godly books I know of would never sell in the stores\u2014they're too truthful. You'll never find books by John R. Rice or Dr. Jack Hyles in your average Christian book store. Why? Because these men of God speak the truth in their books. People today do NOT want to hear the truth. People don\u2019t want to hear the truth because the truth is painful, \u201cAm I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?\u201d (Galatians 4:16).\n\nThis whole mess has become a big money-making machine; it\u2019s all about money. You can\u2019t listen to a so-called \"Christian\" radio/TV program without someone trying to sell you something. All these new perversions of the Bible on the market are all . This alone should show you the nature of their business\u2014money, money, money. The King James Bible is NOT copyrighted \u2014you can\u2019t copyright God\u2019s Word! Countless billions of dollars have been made selling watered-down perversions of the Bible They give us JUST ENOUGH truth in their heretic bibles to try to keep us from learning the real truth--The King James Bible. You won't find the word \"sodomy\" in the New International Version (NIV) because there were 2 homosexuals on the revision committee. How wicked! How sad!\n\nSatan desires to keep people from the truth. The Devil knows that people will not accept him as he is in true color. So the Devil has to deceive people by presenting a lie, wrapped in a truth. If a criminal makes counterfeit money, he does not use a crayon. Rather, he uses the best equipment he can afford to make the counterfeit money look as genuine as possible. He has to or no one would accept his fake money.\n\nIn the same way, Satan has to make his filthy lies and heresy look like it's really the truth. The NIV (HIV sounds better) bible contains more truth than lies, but it DOES contain lies. A quick look at Philippians 2:6 proves what I am saying. The King James Bible says, \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God .\" I double-dog dare you to look up the same verse in the NIV. You may want to be sitting down when you read it. It says that Jesus \"did not consider equality with God something to be grasped.\" Huh? You've got to be kidding? Do you see why we King James folks are putting up such a big fuss over the Bible? Most people don't care about what I am saying and consider this whole Bible matter a non-essential issue. Non-essential?\n\nI'll show you how non-essential it is to God--Read Psalm 138:2...\n\nIt couldn't be clearer that God elevates His Word higher than His own name. The Word of God is higher than the name of Jesus, the name which is above every other name. If you think this whole matter of the Bible is non-essential, than you also think Christ's deity is non-essential. If you thought the deity of Christ was important, you'd hat the NIV. The NIV is just more inoculation from the devil.\n\nWe are so foolish today in this nation. It\u2019s time for us to get back to the old-time religion. It\u2019s time for us to have revival in our churches and in our homes. Turn off the TV and start speaking with the Lord in your favorite chair. Turn off the radio in your car and start speaking with the Lord while your driving. Set aside the magazines, \"Our Daily Bread\", \"Reader's Digest\" and all the other publications that have replaced your Bible reading time. Your not going to grow in the Lord by riding the coat-tails of other believers.\n\nAt some point, it must become real and personal to YOU. It\u2019s time for us to get busy soul-winning, sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with lost sinners. There's lost people all around us, we simply need to make an on-purpose attempt to witness to them. Place a dollar with a tract and give it to someone who asks you for some money. The dollar simply says. \"I care.\" People don't care what you know, until they know that you care. Spend time with God's Word, not man's word. All of the so-called \"Christian\" TV, radio and magazines have failed to make believers soul-winners\u2014they have instead.\n\nHave you been inoculated? If you don't recognize the King James Bible as the ONLY legitimate Bible on the English-speaking market, then you surely have been inoculated. If you think it's no big deal that John MacArthur teaches that Jesus' blood soaked into the ground at the cross and stayed there, then you surely have been inoculated. If you think it's no big deal that Billy Graham and Jack Van Impe both says that Pope John Paul II has been \"the greatest moral voice of the 20th century,\" then you surely have been inoculated. Listen friend, compromise is all around us. Has the devil been keeping you from the real thing? From the truth? Is money your god? It appears to have become the god of the Van Impe's and all the others who have joined the heathen Ecumenical Movement.\n\nI was surprised to learn that Billy Graham used to be a board-member at the Sword-of-the-Lord (decades ago). He backslid and went his own way to pioneer the ecumenical movement which has done much to destroy America. Countless millions are going to burn in hell because of Billy Graham. People who otherwise would have detested the Catholic false religion are now looking up to the Pope as a great man. As I tell folks, The Pope is a dope and he has no hope! Or as one man said, \"You can kiss the Pope's big toe if you want to, give me a hammer.\n\nAs believers, we must contend for the faith--The Bible is still important to God. The blood of Jesus is still important to God. The virgin birth is still important to God. The perfection and sinlessness of Jesus is still important to God. Doctrine is important! The Bible warns us concerning \"doctrines of devils\" in 1st Timothy 4:1. As believers who are grounded in the Word of God, not Our Daily Bread, we must root out and expose these doctrines of devils.\n\nI want to talk about one area where so many believers have been inoculated. MacArthur's teaching on the blood of Christ is a demonic doctrine. Any normal person who reads the Bible knows that the blood of Jesus is what saves us. Jesus' blood did not remain at the cross Mr. MacArthur; rather, Jesus applied His shed blood to the mercy seat in Heaven for our sins. Read John 20:17...\n\nJesus had to take the blood into Heaven to apply to the mercy-seat, just as the Old Testament high-priest entered into the holy of holies and applied the lamb's blood to the mercy-seat. Hebrews 9:24 tells us that Jesus ascended into Heaven \"to appear in the presence of God for us.\"\n\nHow could anyone say that Jesus' blood stayed at the cross? The Old Testament tabernacle was patterned after the one in Heaven (Hebrews 8:5). Robert B. Thieme and John MacArthur are heretics. Moody church in Chicago makes John MacArthur a hero at their annual \"Founder's Week.\" This is a shame. The blood of Jesus is not just a small issue. If you really want to see for yourself what I am talking about, obtain a copy of R. B. Thieme's booklet on the blood of Christ. I was sickened as I read the book. He calls us \"blood-thirsty believers.\"\n\nYou can really tell he has an attitude for the blood. Read John MacArthur's book, \"Our sufficiency in Christ.\" It's R. B. Thieme all over again. Evidently R. B. Thieme trained MacArthur. To say that the person of Christ is what is important, but not the blood, is heresy. The Passover lamb's blood had to be applied to the doorposts of the house. A dead lamb in the backyard was NOT sufficient--The blood needed to be applied. Have your sins been washed in the blood of Jesus?\n\nWhat I have just shared with you concerning Jesus' blood came from . I can safely assure you that you will probably never hear anything like this in a Christian magazine, on a TV program or on the radio station. Do you see why it's important to get into the Bible, the King James Bible? The devil is giving us just enough truth to keep us from the truth . With all the Christian \"substitutes\" for the Bible, we're in big trouble in our churches. No TV show can replace church. No Daily Bread can replace God's Word. No magazine can replace prayer.
