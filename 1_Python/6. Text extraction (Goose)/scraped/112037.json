Our staff have been enjoying the holidays, as we hope that you have done, too!\n\nThe following was originally published on May 14, 2020.\n\nIt was March 20, 2020, seven days after the U.S. Federal Government declared a national emergency over COVID-19. That was just one day after the country hit the dark milestone of 10,000 verified cases. Most people were focused on coping with new lockdown regulations, social distancing, and radical changes to everyday life. What the White House or the CDC could or should do to counter the virus was a subject of debate. Some scientists, however, had identified a surprising object of needed government action.\n\nBiologists at the prominent science journal BioEssays issued an urgent call. What was it, you ask? Try new experimental drugs? Rush a vaccine into development? Shut the schools? Open the schools? No \u2014 censor Evolution News!\n\nDiscovery Institute\u2019s site offers daily analysis of evidence for intelligent design in life and the cosmos. What had we done to spark such an emergency? The timeline seems to be this: The crisis got going after February 11. That day, philosopher of biology Paul Nelson penned a brief post here at Evolution News. Dr. Nelson, a Discovery Institute Senior Fellow, asked \u201cIs Popperian Falsification Useful in Biology?\u201d He was responding to an editorial, from which he borrowed his headline, in BioEssays. Referring to the thought of influential philosopher Karl Popper, Nelson offered his opinion that Popperian falsification is indeed relevant in biology.\n\nThe author of the editorial, biologist Dave Speijer of the University of Amsterdam, read what Nelson had to say and disliked some of the ID proponent\u2019s comments. Speijer was also distraught about a staff-authored article at Evolution News, published back in November 2019. The latter commented on a piece by BioEssays editor Andrew Moore, which Moore titled \u201cThat \u2018junk\u2019 DNA\u2026 is full of information!\u201d\n\nSpeijer condemns the \u201cinfamous Discovery Institute, a notorious \u2018intelligent design\u2019 (aka \u2018creationism in a tuxedo\u2019) think tank.\u201d (Normally they say \u201ccreationism in a cheap tuxedo,\u201d so this represents a sartorial upgrade.) A separate post here will respond to the details of Speijer\u2019s objections, offered in justifying his call for censorship. Let\u2019s just say for now that they are bizarre.\n\nWith videos and other disfavored material being suppressed by YouTube and other social media platforms, where most Americans get our news, it was only a matter of time before would-be Internet censors turned their gaze on us. Speijer submitted his article on February 29, as, incidentally, the U.S. moved to stop travel from Iran and urged citizens to avoid visiting South Korea and Italy. But again, Speijer\u2019s focus was on other perils. Here is the gist of what he wrote. From \u201cBad Faith Reasoning, Predictable Chaos, and the Truth\u201d:\n\nNowadays, such sites [as Evolution News] pose as \u201cobjective\u201d sources of information. Speaking more generally, spreading misinformation can be linked to climate science denial, vaccination avoidance, and a resurgence of pseudo\u2010scientific racism. Internet regulations to counter these sources of pseudo\u2010science are urgently needed\u2026. We have identified the problem; how about the solution? My favorite Thomas Paine quote: \u201cHe that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself,\u201d eloquently explains why I am not a great fan of taking down websites. Only the most egregious ones (for instance, those inciting racial violence or denying well\u2010documented genocide) should be treated thus. But what about the sites discussed in this article? In such cases search engines could have mandatory color coded banners warning of consistent factual errors or unscientific content, masquerading as science. I can almost hear the strongly doubting voices. \u201cThe tech giants will never agree to that.\u201d Make them. \u201cIt is impossible to draw the line, so how will you make sure that you do not stifle healthy debate?\u201d Whenever one proposes internet regulations along these lines, opponents use such arguments to stop us from doing anything. Yes, the line might be difficult to draw, but below are several clear common\u2010sense cases where banner warnings should apply. And by all means, let us contribute to debates about the difficult instances: ongoing debates that a mature complex society with evolving insight should have. After all, scientists are not the ones afraid of complexity.\n\nHis proposal: \u201c[S]earch engines could have mandatory color coded banners warning of consistent factual errors or unscientific content, masquerading as science.\u201d And what if major technology companies shy from censorship? Then the government should take aggressive action: \u201cMake them.\u201d Let this sink in: the peer-reviewed journal BioEssays published an editorial pushing for government censorship policies to decide which websites the tech giants should be forced to take action against, diminishing the reputation and accessibility of those websites. Specifically, the scientists at BioEssays want to censor intelligent design websites like Evolution News.\n\nThere are a number of ironies here. One is that BioEssays calls for censorship while having the chutzpah to quote from Thomas Paine, a foremost spokesman for free speech in Western democracy. As Speijer notes, Paine said:\n\nYet Speijer\u2019s proposal is the epitome of oppressing and restricting the liberty of those with whom he disagrees. Paine further said, \u201cThat government is best which governs least,\u201d but if put into action, the demand from BioEssays would hugely expand government power, creating government policies or even government-backed thought-police boards to determine which ideas are unfit for public consumption and must be censored.\n\nNo Need to Worry\n\nHere\u2019s another irony: the article anticipates resistance from the \u201ctech giants.\u201d On that score, Dr. Speijer should stop worrying so much. A glaring problem, completely off BioEssay\u2019s radar screen, is that Big Tech seems eager to squash ideas they don\u2019t like. Think of YouTube demonetizing Dennis Prager videos, Twitter deciding which tweets ought to come with COVID-19 warning labels, or Facebook appointing a \u201cSupreme Court\u201d to decide which kinds of posts will be tolerated.\n\nFar from balking at censorship, the tech companies are already willing collaborators in efforts to squeeze out ideas that don\u2019t fit their preferred perspective. Be prepared. There is no reason to think that this could not happen to Discovery Institute, Evolution News, and others who urge a fair consideration of design evidence.\n\nHere is Tom Paine again: \u201cIf I do not believe as you believe, it proves that you do not believe as I believe, and that is all that it proves.\u201d But as for Dave Speijer, if you do not believe as he believes, then that proves you need to be censored.\n\nPaine also said: \u201cThese are the times that try men\u2019s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.\u201d\n\nLike most censors, Dr. Speijer thinks his proposals are entirely reasonable and warranted. He writes, \u201cbelow are several clear common\u2010sense cases where banner warnings should apply.\u201d Wait until you see what triggered him. You\u2019ll be shocked at how benign and careful our original comments were, how unwilling ID-critics are to hear any form of criticism, and how the accusations they make against us are, with striking irony, applicable to their own rhetorical tactics. If Speijer\u2019s thinking catches hold in this changing media and cultural environment, Western democracy is in bigger trouble even than it seems to be at the moment.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fireworks-over-Seattle.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "fireworks", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Happy New Year! #1 Story of 2020: Biology Journal Demands Government Censorship of ID | Evolution News", "description": "What if major technology companies shy from censorship?
