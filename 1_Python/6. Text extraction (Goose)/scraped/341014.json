Most importantly, we must prove the wrong in its conviction that it can act recklessly in all but every aspect of diplomacy while maintaining a useful level of interaction in areas that are important to American national interests.\n\nNo, Mr. Biden, you cannot walk and chew gum at the same time. Today, we don\u2019t see any of that \u2018serious\u2019 or \u2018long-term\u2019 attitude. And we watch the pillars of strategic stability (which used to be the foundation of stability in general) undergoing erosion before our very eyes.\n\nThe dialogue that has been expanding (or shrinking) over the last few years was not producing any new agenda \u2013 it was destroying the existing one. The system of international relations is undergoing a truly fundamental shift, the result of which remains unknown. Caution should be exercised.\n\nYesterday, to further notice, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov thanked the US citizens who had sent to the Russian Embassy letters expressing support for friendly Russian-US relations and apologizing for Washington\u2019s ill-considered moves towards Moscow, with his stating: \u201cI am deeply touched by the caring and active position of ordinary Americans who understand that dialogue between our countries should be based on mutual respect and equality\u2026This approach of US. citizens indicates that a potential for normalizing ties between the peoples of Russia and the United States is still there...I hope that the Administration will heed the voices of the voters and discontinue its course aimed at further devastation of the already excessively confrontational relations\u201d\u2014and saw this statement of thanks being followed by famed American conservative news host Candace Owens posting a Tweet to her nearly 3-million followers saying: \u201cI am asking ALL of my followers to RETWEET this: For obvious mental health reasons, @JoeBiden has declined a public discussion with @KremlinRussia\u2026I would like to publicly invite Vladimir Putin sit down with me for a wide-ranging interview on @thecandaceshow\u201d.\n\nMental health issues Biden further displayed yesterday when he couldn\u2019t even walk up the stairs of Air Force One without falling over THREE times, though most dangerously he put on full display for the Communist Chinese\u2014a shocking display of mental illness that began when a deranged sex addict gunned down 8 innocent people in Atlanta-Georgia, 6 of whom were Asian women, because he wanted to \u201celiminate temptation\u201d\u2014saw FBI Director Christopher Wray confirming that this vile killing had nothing at all to do with race\u2014but then saw mentally ill Biden ignoring this reality to claim this killing was racially motivated and saying \u201cWe Cannot Be Complicit\u201d\u2014after which his second-in-command socialist leader Kamala Harris, standing right beside him, astonishingly declared \u201cRacism is real in America, and it has always been\u201d.\n\nOccurring at the same time Biden was putting on this full display of mental illness to change reality; his top diplomats were holding the first meeting with their Communist Chinese counterparts in Alaska\u2014a meeting wherein even the leftist Washington Post had to honestly report \u201cthe Biden administration gets a taste of China\u2019s \u2018wolf warrior\u2019 diplomacy\u201d\u2014saw the Chinese saying their meeting with Biden\u2019s diplomats had a \u201cStrong Smell of Gunpowder and Drama\u201d\u2014then saw the Chinese directly telling Biden: \u201cThe US Does Not Have the Qualification to Speak to China From a Position of Strength\u201d\u2014and to the true and lasting damage mentally ill Biden has wrought on his own country this week alone, sees it being best described in the article \u201cBiden and Blinken\u2019s Unprovoked Attacks On Russia And China Backfire...Because If You Live In A Glass House, Don\u2019t Throw Stones\u201d, that says: \u201cThe collapse of what passed for a coordinated position of diplomatically confronting both Russia and China has left the US scrambling to navigate through the detritus of its own policy shipwreck\u201d.\n\nIncluded in the shipwreck of mentally ill Biden\u2019s failed policies, it bears noticing, is the COVID vaccine disaster being caused by unproven mRNA vaccines using nanoparticle-protected live viruses\u2014which unlike Russia\u2019s first in the world Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s dead virus vaccines long proven safe over decades of use, keep killing people\u2014deaths occurring in people taking the AstraZeneca vaccine using mRNA live viruses, that Norwegian researches have discovered provoke a \u201cstrong immune response\u201d causing deadly blood clots\u2014a shock discovery confirmed by German scientists, who then said the AstraZeneca vaccine can cause thrombosis in the BRAIN in \u201crare\u201d cases.\n\nWith Finland suspending the AstraZeneca vaccine despite European regulators saying it is safe and effective, it bears grim notice that the European Commission warned yesterday that a third wave of COVID-19 is \u201con the horizon\u201d in Europe\u2014a warning that was quickly followed by German Health Minister Jens Spahn stating that there are not enough vaccines in Europe yet to stop a third wave of the pandemic\u2014all of which is coming at the same time it\u2019s further being warned that this pandemic may have left over 250-million people with acute food shortages in 2020.\n\nToday, in fact, South Sudan faces life-threatening food shortages as its harvests fall by 50%, and both Lebanon and Myanmar have run out of food\u2014though to fully comprehend the historic magnitude of this growing global crisis, one need only read the seemingly innocuous report \u201cFood Price Surge Is Unlikely to Revert\u201d\u2014a report released this week by the Dutch multinational banking and financial services giant Rabobank, that is the global leader in food and agriculture financing and sustainability-oriented banking\u2014but whose beyond fearful findings are being described in articles like \u201cOn The Verge Of A Global Crisis: One Bank Warns Of A \u201cBiblical\u201d Surge In Food Prices\u201d.\n\nOn the day Rabobank released their actual food price doomsday findings, Russia was able to announce that it become a net exporter of food for first time in post-Soviet history\u2014and to protect the Russian people, the Kremlin introduced an export limit and a tax hike on exports of grains in an effort to keep excess supplies at home to prevent domestic food prices from rising.\n\nWith the entire South Western growing region of the United States experiencing one of its worst droughts in history, however, Biden further displayed how actually mentally ill he is by signing into law the socialist monstrosity called a COVID relief bill\u2014wherein is buried \u201cSection 1005\u201d, which astonishingly bans all white farmers in America from receiving US government aid---and for what these unsuspecting Americans living under tyrannical socialist rule can expect in the near future, should see them urgently reading and heeding such warning articles like \u201c\u2019Things Are Out Of Control\u2019 - There Is A Shortage Of Everything And Prices Are Soaring: What Happens Next\u201d.
