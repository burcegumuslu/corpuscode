While the disease usually involves the small and large intestines, it can occur anywhere in the digestive system (e.g., anywhere from the mouth to the anus).\n\nIn the early stages, regional enteritis causes small and scattered erosions or shallow crater-like areas called aphthous ulcers in the inner surface of the bowel. As the disease progresses, the ulcers will deepen and grow larger. This causes scarring and stiffness of the bowel while the bowel also becomes narrower. The bowels will eventually become too narrow and have obstructions.\n\nDeep ulcers may cause puncture holes in the bowel wall that can result in an infection in the peritoneum/abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and in adjacent organs.\n\u2022 Terminal ileitis \u2013 Involves the end of the small intestine or the terminal ileum.\n\u2022 Crohn\u2019s enterocolitis/ileocolitis \u2013 Involves both the small intestine and the large intestine.\n\nRegional enteritis is also called Crohn\u2019s disease or granulomatous enteritis. The disease was named after Burrill Crohn, who identified the disease in 1932.\n\nWithout treatment, the signs of regional enteritis may be constant. The side effects may also recur after several weeks or months. The recurrence of the disease\u2019s side effects is known as a flare-up or relapse while the periods between the flare-ups are called remission.\n\nChildren with regional enteritis may develop more slowly than usual.\n\nThe common side effects of regional enteritis usually include:\n\u2022 Stomachaches and cramps (usually in the lower-right part of the stomach)\n\nOther side effects of the disease include:\n\u2022 Patches of painful, red, and swollen skin (usually on the legs)\n\u2022 Age \u2013 The disease usually develops in people aged 15 to 30.\n\u2022 Genetics \u2013 Risk of developing the disease increases if you have a family member diagnosed with regional enteritis.\n\u2022 Smoking \u2013 Smokers are at risk of developing regional enteritis.\n\u2022 Surgery \u2013 The disease is more common in patients who\u2019ve had their appendix removed.\n\nRegional enteritis may cause the following complications:\n\u2022 Cancer \u2013 Patients with the disease are at risk of developing cancer of the colon.\n\u2022 Fistulas \u2013 A fistula occurs when inflammation forms a channel between two parts of the body, such as between a part of the small intestine and a part of the colon. When a patient has a fistula, the contents of their gut may then leak into the other organs.\n\u2022 Osteoporosis \u2013 Called the \u201cthinning\u201d of the bones, the increased risk for osteoporosis is due to the poor absorption of food that occurs in some people with severe forms of the disease.\n\u2022 Perforations \u2013 These are small holes that form in the wall of the gut. The contents of the gut may then leak out and cause an infection or an abscess inside the abdomen. A perforation can be severe and life-threatening.\n\u2022 Strictures \u2013 The narrowing of part of the gastrointestinal tract/gut, a stricture occurs when scar tissue forms in the wall of an inflamed part of the gut. A stricture may prevent food from passing through (called an obstruction). This may cause pain and vomiting.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent regional enteritis\n\nThe following foods or nutrients can help prevent regional enteritis or address its side effects:\n\u2022 Almond milk \u2013 Almond milk contains calcium, and vitamin D and E, but without cholesterol or saturated fat. Check the label and buy almond milk without added sweeteners\n\u2022 Eggs \u2013 Eggs are a good source of protein that\u2019s easy to digest.\n\u2022 Oatmeal \u2013 Oatmeal has soluble fiber that can absorb water and passes more slowly through the digestive tract.\n\u2022 Papaya \u2013 Papaya, along with fruits like banana, cantaloupe, and mango, is full of nutrients and easy to digest.\n\u2022 Salmon \u2013 Salmon, like most seafood, is a good source of lean protein. It also contains omega-3 fatty acids. Other sources include shrimp and white fish like flounder and tilapia.\n\u2022 Vegetable soups \u2013 Serve pureed vegetables full of nutrients like butternut squash, carrots, parsnips, and pumpkins.\n\nTreatment for regional enteritis includes medications for inflammation or surgery.\n\nMild cases of the disease often resolve themselves after several days and patients don\u2019t need medical treatment. However, individuals with diarrhea must replenish their fluids.\n\nChildren and young adults can also follow a liquid diet/enteral nutrition to help manage the symptoms of the disease. A liquid diet includes special drinks that have all the nutrients you need, instead of a solid diet, for several weeks.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Being a \u201cvaccine heretic\u201d against the church of big pharma; Co-opting scientific research\n\u2022 Junk food, antibiotics cause Crohn\u2019s disease rates to triple among young persons\n\nRegional enteritis refers to a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine.\n\nThe common signs of regional enteritis usually include bloody stools, diarrhea, and fatigue.\n\nRegional enteritis may cause complications like cancer, fistulas, osteoporosis, perforations, and strictures.\n\nTreatment for regional enteritis includes medications for inflammation or surgery.\n\nMild cases of the disease often resolve themselves after several days and patients don\u2019t need medical treatment.", "opengraph": {"title": "Regional enteritis \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/regional-enteritis-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Regional enteritis refers to\u00a0a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine.
