After the infection, the immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease.\n\nVaccines allegedly help develop immunity by imitating an infection. Once the imitation infection induced by the vaccine goes away, the body is left with a supply of \u201cmemory\u201d t-cells and antibodies that will remember how to fight that disease in the future\n\nSo, when the authorities state that the effectiveness of the vaccines weaken over time, what they really mean is that the performance of your immune system weakens over time.\n\nIn regards to the Covid-19 injections \u2013\n\u2022 A vaccine effectiveness of +50% would mean that the fully vaccinated are 50% more protected against Covid-19 than the unvaccinated. In other words the fully vaccinated have an immune system that is 50% better at tackling Covid-19.\n\u2022 A vaccine effectiveness of 0% would mean that the fully vaccinated are no more protected against Covid-19 than the unvaccinated, meaning the vaccines are ineffective. In other words the fully vaccinated have an immune system that is equal to that of the unvaccinated at tackling Covid-19.\n\u2022 Buta vaccine effectiveness of -50% would mean that the unvaccinated were 50% more protected against Covid-19 than the fully vaccinated. In other words the immune system performance of the vaccinated is 50% worse than the natural immune system performance of the unvaccinated. Therefore, the Covid-19 vaccines have damaged the immune system.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) publishes a weekly Vaccine Surveillance Report, with each report containing four weeks worth of data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths by vaccination status.\n\nHere are the Covid-19 case-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status for each age group over the age of 18 in England, plus the average case rate per 100,000 for all adults in England taken from the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance Report \u2013 Week 5 \u2013 2022 \u2013\n\nAs you can see the case-rate per 100k is clearly lowest among the unvaccinatied population in all age groups, with case rates among the triple vaccined population approximately double the rate seen among the unvaccinated in most age groups, and case rates among the double vaccinated population approximately triple the rate seen among the unvaccinated in most age groups.\n\nThis data alone should deeply concern even the most avid vaccine advocates.\n\nNow that we know the case-rates, we can use Pfizer\u2019s vaccine effectiveness formula to work out the real-world vaccine effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, the average real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in England for all adults as a whole in January 2022 was MINUS-183%.\n\nHere\u2019s how effective the Covid-19 vaccines are proving to be in each double vaccinated age group \u2013\n\nThe lowest Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness was seen in the 40-49 age group in England throughout January 2022, recorded at minus-209.4%, with the 50-59 age group not far behind.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, as we proved with the evidence presented in Exhibit A, Vaccine effectiveness isn\u2019t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nTherefore, the UKHSA data actually shows that the Covid-19 injections are decimating the natural immune system.\n\nUK Data actually shows the Fully Vaccinated have a Negative Immune System Performance\n\nTo work out immune system performance we have to alter the calculation used to work out vaccine effectiveness slightly and divide our answer by either the largest of the vaccinated or unvaccinated case rate as per the case rates provided in Exhibit B.\n\nThe following chart shows the true extent of the damage caused to the double vaccinated populations immune systems by age group in January 2022 \u2013", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://expose-news.com/2022/12/27/fatal-link-covid-vaccine-aids/", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-surveillance-reports", "https://expose-news.com/2021/10/29/ukhsa-report-covid-vaccines-negative-effectiveness-minus-132-percent/", "https://expose-news.com/2022/12/27/fatal-link-covid-vaccine-aids/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "December 28, 2022"}
