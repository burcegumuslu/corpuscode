Does that make benefiting wrong? We benefit from land that was violently stolen from indigenous people. We benefit from companies and industries and social systems that were built on the backs of slave labor and colonial imperialism and oppression. Heck, we benefit from manufacturing practices that currently enslave children and pollute the world to the point of killing poor people who have to live in the degraded environments.\n\nThe only reason Christians are outraged over this vaccine issue is because abortion is such a politicized issue that generates passion that can be channeled in support of other issues.
