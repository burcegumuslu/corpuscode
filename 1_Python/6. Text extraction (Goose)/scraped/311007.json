Governments and pharma companies have rushed a new experimental RNA technology into use, for the first time in history. Prior to the COVID injection, all attempts to force approval of RNA tech had failed; dangerous and deadly over-reaction of the immune system was the reason.\n\nSince I seem to be one of the only people saying this, I\u2019ll say it again: Bill Gates, Fauci, and other rabid vaccinators are in love with RNA tech. It allows vaccines to be produced far more quickly, easily, and cheaply.\n\nFor any purported virus, at the drop of a hat, companies can come up with a vaccine. It doesn\u2019t take four years. It takes three months.\n\nThen there is this: the COVID vaccines manufactured by AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna are completely ineffective at preventing serious illness. BY DESIGN.\n\nMonths ago, a NY Times piece, by Peter Doshi and Eric Topol, spelled it out.\n\nSeptember 22, 2020: \u201cThese Coronavirus Trials Don\u2019t Answer the One Question We Need to Know\u201d: \u201cIf you were to approve a coronavirus vaccine, would you approve one that you only knew protected people only from the most mild form of Covid-19, or one that would prevent its serious complications?\u201d [Clue: \u201cmost mild\u201d means cough, or chills and fever, which cure themselves without the need for a vaccine.] \u201cThe answer is obvious. You would want to protect against the worst cases.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s not how the companies testing three of the leading coronavirus vaccine candidates, Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, whose U.S. trial is on hold, are approaching the problem.\u201d \u201cAccording to the protocols for their studies, which they released late last week, a vaccine could meet the companies\u2019 benchmark for success if it lowered the risk of mild Covid-19, but was never shown to reduce moderate or severe forms of the disease, or the risk of hospitalization, admissions to the intensive care unit or death.\u201d \u201cTo say a vaccine works should mean that most people no longer run the risk of getting seriously sick. That\u2019s not what these trials will determine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s coronavirus task force knew the truth. Biden\u2019s task force knows the truth. But they don\u2019t care.\n\nThe CDC and the WHO know. They don\u2019t care, either.\n\nBut these authorities are very nervous, because droves of people are avoiding the vaccine. It\u2019s not \u201chesitancy.\u201d\n\nIt began soon after the initial rollout of the Pfizer vaccine. NBC News, December 31, 2020:\n\nAnd all that was long before 20 countries suspended the injection.\n\nI\u2019ll close, for now, with two statements about the role vaccines have played in eliminating deaths from diseases\u2014because true history matters:\n\n\u201cThe combined death rate from scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough and measles among children up to fifteen shows that nearly 90 percent of the total decline in mortality between 1860 and 1965 had occurred before the introduction of antibiotics and widespread immunization. In part, this recession may be attributed to improved housing and to a decrease in the virulence of micro-organisms, but by far the most important factor was a higher host-resistance due to better nutrition.\u201d Ivan Illich, Medical Nemesis, Bantam Books, 1977 Robert F Kennedy, Jr.: \u201cAfter extensively studying a century of recorded data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins researchers concluded: \u2018Thus vaccinations does not account for the impressive declines in mortality from infectious diseases seen in the first half of the twentieth century\u2019.\u201d \u201cSimilarly, in 1977, Boston University epidemiologists (and husband and wife) John and Sonja McKinlay published their seminal work in the Millbank Memorial Fund Quarterly on the role that vaccines (and other medical interventions) played in the massive 74% decline in mortality seen in the twentieth century: \u2018The Questionable Contribution of Medical Measures to the Decline of Mortality in the United States in the Twentieth Century\u2019.\u201d \u201cIn this article, which was formerly required reading in U.S. medical schools, the McKinlays pointed out that 92.3% of the mortality rate decline happened between 1900 and 1950, before most vaccines existed, and that all medical measures, including antibiotics and surgeries, \u2018appear to have contributed little to the overall decline in mortality in the United States since about 1900 \u2014 having in many instances been introduced several decades after a marked decline had already set in and having no detectable influence in most instances\u2019.\u201d\n\nJon Rappoport is the author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29thDistrict of California.
