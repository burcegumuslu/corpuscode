British pharmaceutical behemoth GlaxoSmithKline, however, made headlines when they pled guilty to three criminal charges. They settled to pay $1 billion in criminal fines and $2 billion in civil fines. This settlement surpasses the $2.3 billion Pfizer agreed to pay in 2009 for inappropriately marketing 13 drugs.\n\n\u201c[This] is unprecedented in both size and scope,\u201d said James Cole, the US Deputy Attorney General.\n\nThe charges against GSK include marketing the antidepressant Paxil to minors when it was only approved for adults. In fact, in 2003, the FDA warned against Paxil administration to teens and youth due to a heightened risk of suicide.\n\nGSK also promoted Wellbutrin for unapproved uses like weight loss and sexual dysfunction. The Justice Department\u2019s criminal information files even state that \u201cGSK sales representatives sometimes referred to Wellbutrin as \u2018the happy, horny, skinny pill\u2019 when touting its unapproved uses.\u201d\n\nThe third drug in question, the diabetes drug Avandia, had safety issues that went illegally unreported to the US Food and Drug Administration. GSK pled guilty to these three misdemeanor criminal counts.\n\nSince the late 1990s, GSK has been sending doctors to spas, expensive restaurants, and vacations to Hawaii in order to promote their drugs (such as the three in question). According to US attorney Carmin Ortiz, they even paid millions of dollars for doctors to go on speaking tours and bought them tickets to Madonna concerts.\n\nGlaxo CEO Sir Andrew Witty (who was, ironically, knighted in 2012 for services to the economy and the UK pharmaceutical industry) promised to rectify the problems. \u201cOn behalf of GSK, I want to express or regret and reiterate that we have learnt from the mistakes that were made.\u201d\n\nSnaky, corporate types don\u2019t pay for their misdeeds as often as we\u2019d like. (We were happy to report that Monsanto coughed up $93 million to victims of their herbicides earlier this year.) GSK\u2019s unprecedented fines, however, might at least help to spread word to the masses of the indecent behaviors of such companies, and maybe even send a warning that not even Big Pharma is impervious to the justice system.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "GlaxoSmithKline Forced to Pay $3 Billion Over Faking Research, Bribing Doctors", "description": "British pharmaceutical behemoth GlaxoSmithKline, however, made headlines when they pled guilty to three criminal charges.", "url": "https://naturalsociety.com/glaxosmithkline-forced-to-pay-3-billion-over-faking-research/", "site_name": "Natural Society", "article:tag": "Pharmaceutical Industry", "article:section": "Featured", "article:published_time": "2012-07-03T10:48:52+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-24T06:19:04+00:00", "updated_time": "2021-02-24T01:19:04-05:00", "image": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2021/02/fallback-featured.png", "image:secure_url": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2021/02/fallback-featured.png", "image:width": "730", "image:height": "288", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://naturalsociety.com/monsanto-pays-93-million-to-victims-in-settlement/", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/02/glaxosmithkline-drug-fraud?newsfeed=true", "http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/07/02/156116607/glaxo-pleads-guilty-to-3-charges-in-sweeping-health-settlement"], "authors": ["Lisa Garber"], "publish_date": "2012-07-03T10:48:52+00:00"}
