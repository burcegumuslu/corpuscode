Despite requests from journalists, lawmakers and an EU watchdog, von der Leyen\u2019s office has failed to produce personal text messages sent to Bourla during talks for nearly 2 billion vaccine doses, prompting accusations of corruption.\n\nCroatian MEP Mislav Kolakusic noted the new investigation later on Friday, saying the decision was made thanks to pressure from lawmakers. Though he was unable to shed additional light on the probe, Kolakusic has been highly critical of the EU\u2019s vaccine procurement process, claiming deals for billions of doses were marred by \u201ccorruption\u201d and secrecy.\n\nLast month, the European Court of Auditors said that it has asked the commission to provide information on \u201cpreliminary negotiations\u201d for the EU\u2019s largest Pfizer purchase \u2013 including \u201cscientific experts consulted and advice received, timing of the talks, records of the discussions, and details of the agreed terms and conditions\u201d \u2013 but added that \u201cnone was forthcoming.\u201d The European Commission still has yet to make the information public, fueling corruption allegations from MEPs.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "EU Opens Probe Into Vaccine Deals - Europe Reloaded", "description": "ER Editor: See this we published yesterday \u2014 Covid Vaccines Are the Biggest Corruption Scandal in the History of the World says MEP See also this from MEP Cristian Terhes\u2019 group: EU Press Conference After [...]", "url": "https://www.europereloaded.com/eu-opens-probe-into-vaccine-deals/", "site_name": "Europe Reloaded", "article:published_time": "2022-10-15T05:59:45+00:00", "image": "https://www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/EPPOProbeVaxPurchase-min.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "280", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["European Public Prosecutor's Office", "EU vaccine deals", "EU purchases billions of covid vaccines", "RT", "MEP Mislav Kolakusic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.eppo.europa.eu/en/news/ongoing-eppo-investigation-acquisition-covid-19-vaccines-eu", "https://www.rt.com/news/554394-european-mps-sue-ec-vaccines/", "https://twitter.com/mislavkolakusic/status/1580924517526175747", "https://twitter.com/mislavkolakusic/status/1580132343758540800", "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/12/SR-19-2022-COVID-19-vaccine-procurement.pdf", "https://www.rt.com/news/564700-eu-prosecutor-vaccine-purchases/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS"], "authors": ["Pam Barker"], "publish_date": "2022-10-15T05:59:45+00:00"}
