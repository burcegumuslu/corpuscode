The latter triggers a response in the systemic immune system, while the former targets the site of its administration.\n\nIntramuscular vaccination is incapable of producing mucosal immunity or immunity in the respiratory tract, which is very ideal since it is the body\u2019s first line of defense. Through intranasal vaccination, recipients could benefit from the protection against respiratory infection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having guards behind the castle\u2019s gate versus having guards in front,\u201d Benjamin Goldman-Israelow, an infectious diseases researcher at Yale, told The Guardian.\n\nConsidering how nasal vaccines work, scientists view it as the most realistic way of achieving mucosal immunity and breaking the chain of COVID transmission. At least eight nasal vaccines for COVID-19 are in development, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThere are challenges involved in developing nasal spray vaccines, however. For one thing, scientists have less experience with nasal vaccines compared to intramuscular doses due to lack of funding. There is also the possibility of unexpected side effects showing up along the way.\n\n\u201cThere are market failures in vaccine development because companies are reluctant to take the risks. They don\u2019t reap the full benefits to society. If they\u2019re going to have to bear the costs and risks without substantial public funding, not enough research happens,\u201d Douglas said.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Medical Daily", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/covid-19-vaccine-shot-vs-nasal-spray-which-better-466590", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine Shot vs. Nasal Spray: Which Is Better?", "description": "Scientists want a renewed focus on nasal vaccines amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.", "image": "https://d.medicaldaily.com/en/full/466594/nasal-vaccine.jpg", "image:alt": "nasal vaccine", "image:width": "594", "image:height": "412", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MedicalDaily/", "article:section": "Covid-19", "article:tag": "Coronavirus (COVID-19)", "article:published_time": "2022-08-22T01:06:10-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-22T01:10:38-04:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/covid-nasal-vaccines-scientists-hope-help-halt-transmission", "https://www.smh.com.au/national/nasal-vaccines-could-snuff-out-covid-but-the-hurdles-are-not-to-be-sneezed-at-20220818-p5bars.html", "/la-offers-free-covid-19-testing-pets-exposed-virus-466569", "/ivermectin-covid-19-not-effective-says-large-study-466551", "/many-omicron-patients-unintentionally-spread-covid-19-variant-study-466545"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-22T01:06:10-04:00"}
