Soon after finishing my initial training in surgery, he travelled to U.K. in 1990 for the higher education, training, and experience. He successfully qualified Fellowship in Surgery from U.K. and Ireland in November 1995 .He has 30 years of unblemished medical record while working for the NHS in U.K.\n\nHe was trained in Ireland and U.K. throughout my training from 1990-1996 and have been working as a Consultant General, Colorectal, laparoscopic & Breast Surgeon in U.K. for the last 25 years. I have been heavily involved in teaching, training to post& undergraduates by lecturing, workshops, and scientific conferences in Uk & Pakistan.\n\nHe has been travelling back & forward to Pakistan for teaching, training , charity, and human relief . For example, In July -August 2019 I visited 10 different medical colleges & medical universities in Pakistan and delivery lectures, conducted workshop , conferences, and secured many awards , shields and letters of appreciation. I was awarded as \u201cInternational Speaker for scientific innovation\u201d.\n\nHe conducted two historical international scientific conferences at his workplace in Royal Oldham Hospital Manchester, Northern Alliance Trust on 13/6/2019 to 15/06/2019 and 27/09/2019 participated by hundreds of overseas delegates to promote scientific research, exchange of knowledge, innovation & research work.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, Mr Mohammad I Adil FRCS specialist in Cancer Surgery was a highly regarded practicing Surgeon in U.K. with 30 years of unblemished medical record. He was Teacher & Trainer and a program director for post & undergraduates and a clinical Expert in diagnosing and treating his patients specially Breast & Bowel cancer Surgery, Gallbladder surgery, hernias, endoscopies and other major surgical operations as an elective and emergency surgery.\n\nHe was working as a Consultant General & Colorectal Surgeon at a major academic centre and tertiary medical care unit North Manchester General Hospital, Northern Alliance Trust, Manchester U.K in early 2020. He was well respected by his patients, colleagues, medical students, and paramedics.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit the world in early 2020, Mr Adil started thinking critically about it until it arrived in U.K. March 2020. As a qualified surgeon, researcher and critically oriented mind Mr Adil felt a duty to find a treatment for the disease to safeguard humanity based on his Medical ethics. He believed it\u2019s best to tackle a sickness and treat the cancers earlier which shows better results before it becomes life threatening.\n\nHe commenced a scientific debate on the social media to invite other clinicians , scientists, and health professionals to discuss further about the novel SAR -COV2 appreciated by many thousands of people across the world and was a life saver.\n\nBut his Trust did not like his vision and dedicated work and he was dismissed by the order of the medical director Jonathan Moise on 22/4/2020 without any warning , charge sheet notice , formal meeting, advice or following any disciplinary procedures. He was asked to leave the hospital premises with immediate effect like he was a criminal or drug trafficker which he felt extremely humiliating and disgraceful.\n\nOn 07/5/2020 Northern United Lincolnshire Trust treated him the same way and dismissed his locum consultant work.\n\nHe had no clinical or patient related issue or complaint, social, Ethical, Probity, colleague complaint or Health issue whatsoever while working in both Trusts .\n\nOn 01/6/2020 General medical council (GMC) suspended his licence to practice for 12 months in a short hearing over a Skype . GMC further extended his suspension order for another 12 months on 26/05/2021 and referred his case to the Medical Professional Tribunal Services ( MPTS) a branch of the GMC after 12 months for hearing between 13/6/2022-01/07/2022 . This was totally inappropriate, unfair, and discretionary.\n\nHe appeared in the MPTS court which lasted for 3 weeks from 13/06/2022 until 01/07/2022 where GMC failed to prove any allegation against Mr Adil but instead chairman of the MPTS Kangaroo Court Mr Damien Cooper, a corporate lawyer and a pharmacist further suspended his suspension order for another 6 months .\n\nHe had no choice but pursued to the honourable High Court which has been fixed for the hearing on 15/02/2023.\n\nMr Adil established World Doctor Alliance (WDA) on 11/05/2020 in collaboration with the international doctors with at least 12 founder members from different part of the world which is most vibrant and fastest growing medical organisation with millions of followers and members contributing their research, publication, and health services for the public to support the health-related issues.\n\nDuring Covid -19-time, lockdown was imposed on U.K. on 23/3/2020 extraordinary restrictions imposed on public. WDA members contributed a great deal in supporting public and created awareness for their health & wellbeing to safeguard humanity.\n\nMany members of the WDA made extraordinary efforts to save lives by reassuring them over the social media and worldwide million March and rallies to support public and created assembly and protests across the world and promoted freedom of speech and expression, civil liberties and human rights which were totally violated by the respective governments of countries in a planned way, WDA has been of great support to the public.\n\nWDA conducted National and worldwide rallies and protests to lift the lock down and restrictions on the public and many members were penalised by their respective Regulatory Bodies.\n\nThis is the story of Mr Mohamnad Adil a competent Surgeon with 30 years of unblemished medical record while serving community in this country.\n\nHe simply along with his colleagues trying to safeguard public and developed an early treatment protocol of generic to safeguard millions of COVID-19 patients from hospitalization and preventable death in nursing and care homes and in the private homes.\n\nHe opposed the total cessation of the health services for the public during lockdown and he suggested parallel treatment of the patients along with Covid patients in the hospitals but Health authorities and government did not take his valuable advice resulting over 8 million patients waiting for their investigations and treatments, but NHS has failed to tackle the situation . Majority of patients have gone to the private sector and NHS has totally collapsed in U.K.\n\nOn the contrary, the news of his promising results with the reassurance to public were dismissed as soon as it was reported to the Trust and regulator.\n\nAt first Mr Adil effort seemed like conventional scepticisms, but then his papers were regarded fraudulent and false interpretations maligning the protocol\u2019s for treating his other patients parallel in the same hospital without closing the doors of the hospitals for everyone other than Covid patients.\n\nDespite his efforts & success, his early care and intervention protocol was not welcomed by public health officials (MHRA), NHS and GMC and unfortunately, he was penalised by these regulators with suspension order since 01/06/2020 which is a waste of such a qualified, highly skilled, and talented surgeon which is damaging to the public health during the health crisis.\n\nThis and other acts of fraud revealed that a coordinated smear campaign against early treatment was being waged. Mr Mohammad Adil instead was soon found himself censored, vilified in the media, and fired from his two jobs fighting for his survival in a biased and hostile environment.\n\nThe greatest victims of the smear campaign were COVID-19 patients especially the cancer patients who were consequently deprived of early treatment. Hundreds of thousands needlessly died of the disease in the nursing and care homes and in their private homes.\n\nMany thousand youngsters suicided due to depression, isolation, financial hardship due to unprecedented lockdown.\n\nAt the same time early treatment was suppressed, the UK government and mainstream media proclaimed that the cure to COVID-19 lay in a new generation of vaccines that were being developed at warp speed in middle of 2020.\n\nThese were heralded as a forthcoming panacea that would save mankind and restore normalcy. As soon as they were mass deployed, public health officials would lift the restrictions on social and economic life.\n\nMr Adil said, \u201cThe potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our civil liberties or democratic human rights processes\u201d.\n\nAs Mr Mohammad Adil and his colleagues learned, Eisenhower\u2019s warning has become equally applicable to the Bio-Pharmaceutical Complex of multinational drug companies, the MHRA , Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and widely rolled out experimental , unlicensed roll out of vaccines by the health agencies, research, and virology labs, MRHA, NHS and the Gates Foundation.\n\nSince early COVID-19 arrived, this Complex has obtained misplaced power over every aspect of our lives and taken our liberties. The Courage to Face Covid-19 recounts how Mr Mohammad Adil and his colleagues began their work by fighting a novel infectious disease, and then became leaders in fighting the tyrannical regime that endangers our United Kingdom way of life.\n\nBut Mr Adil has not lost hopes yet and believes public and himself would get their human rights and civil liberties back and Medical Ethics would prevail to safeguard humanity.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
