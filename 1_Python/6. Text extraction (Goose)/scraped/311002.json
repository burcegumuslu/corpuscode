According to ITV.com,1 hundreds of no-vaccine-passport protesters surged into the Westfield shopping mall in London, while another large crowd gathered in Parliament Square.\n\nThey were reportedly cleared from the mall after about 20 minutes by police, but no one was injured or arrested in this particular instance.\n\nAs reported by Reuters2 May 30, 2021, it now looks like the U.K. will be scrapping its plan for vaccine passports as a legal requirement for large events, although a government spokesman told Reuters that a final decision has yet to be made and that the COVID-19 vaccine certification review is still ongoing. Why the sudden change? Undoubtedly, it\u2019s because Britons have repeatedly taken to the streets in protest of the medical apartheid these passports create.\n\nIn the U.S., there\u2019s also good news. A number of states have enacted laws that ban vaccine passport requirements in order to prevent the creation of a two-tier society of those with the freedom to live as they please, and others whose lives would be restricted based on vaccination status alone.\n\nAs of May 28, 2021, the following 14 states have banned vaccine passports from being required:3 Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Wyoming.\n\nUtah has issued a partial ban that applies to state government only. Only two states so far \u2014 Hawaii and New York \u2014 have actually implemented vaccine certification requirements for certain activities.\n\nIn Hawaii, only those with proof of vaccination are allowed to travel between counties without pretravel testing and quarantine restrictions, while New York requires you to be vaccinated or have a recent negative COVID-19 test to enter certain sports arenas and large performance venues.\n\nIn my home state of Florida, one of the best pro-freedom governors in the U.S., Ron DeSantis, is now fighting the cruise industry over its proposed vaccination passport requirement.4 The bill he signed into law May 3, 2021,5 prohibits state government from issuing vaccine passports and private businesses from requiring proof of vaccination status to enter or obtain services.\n\nAs such, cruise lines that do business in Florida and want to restrict travel to vaccinated-only are in violation of this new anti-medical apartheid law. As reported by NBC News:6\n\nA Social Credit System Is the End Goal of Vaccine Passports\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that vaccine passports or any other type of certification in and of themselves are not the end goal here. They\u2019re merely a part of a much larger plan to implement a social credit system, such as that already implemented in China. First, they\u2019d be expanded to cover other required vaccinations.\n\nBooster shots against COVID-19 variants would logically come first, followed by any number of other vaccinations. The sky\u2019s the limit as far as that\u2019s concerned, and many are likely to be gene-based and therefore dangerous in the extreme. Already, vaccine makers have announced they\u2019re working on a combination COVID-flu/mRNA vaccine,7 a pneumococcal-COVID/mRNA booster shot for adults over 65,8 and mRNA/seasonal influenza vaccines.9\n\nUltimately, the vaccine passport will expand to include not just vaccination status but also other medical data, basic identification records, financial data and just about anything else that can be digitized and tracked. It may even extend to include real-time biological data.\n\nThe end goal is to end freedom as we know it, using a social credit system to ensure compliance. If you disobey or act \u201cout of line\u201d with a prevailing dictate, your freedom to travel, bank, shop, get a loan or even leave your home could be vastly restricted.\n\nWe can see how such a system could work by looking at the Chinese social credit system10 where behavior is electronically monitored to assess \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d in real-time. Aside from failing to pay taxes on time, score-lowering actions can include such minutia as cheating in an online video game, jaywalking, not visiting your parents on a frequent-enough basis, smoking in a nonsmoking zone or walking your dog without a leash.\n\nMomentary thoughtlessness can also land you on any one of hundreds of blacklists controlled by a variety of state agencies with their own jurisdictions, and if you end up on one, you\u2019re typically subject to blacklisting across all of them, at which point you won\u2019t be allowed to do much of anything except work to improve your score. On average, it takes two to five years to get off a blacklist, and that\u2019s assuming you comply with all the recommendations put forth.11\n\nWhile the Chinese social credit score is still in its infancy, eventually, the plan is to use it to \u201csearch for signs of potentially harmful behavior before it occurs\u201d12 \u2014 in other words, a real-world pre-crime type of situation as illustrated in the movie \u201cMinority Report.\u201d This is what vaccine passports can lead to, and there\u2019s every reason to believe that is the plan.\n\nAs noted by Naomi Wolf, a former adviser to the Clinton administration, in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Steve Hilton:13,14\n\nIt\u2019s All Been Building to This Point\n\nIndeed, recreating China\u2019s social credit system here in the U.S. is likely easier at this point than anyone would like to think, and probably wouldn\u2019t take long to implement. Silicon Valley titan Oracle nabbed the contract to be the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s central data repository for all COVID-19 vaccine data in the U.S. early on in the pandemic.\n\nOracle also manages the database for COVID-19 cases and the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) database for clinical research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs, a program overseen by Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nNow consider this: Oracle has for many years also managed the U.S. national security database, as well as databases for the CIA, Navy Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence and the National Security Agency, plus banking, and a host of commercial databases. As reported by The Defender:15\n\nAnd, as Ellison admitted in 2002, thousands of databases can easily be integrated into a single national file \u2014 something he offered to do for free for the U.S. government all the way back then.\n\nThe Defender also recounts an old Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program called Total Information Awareness (TIA), which sought to collect the medical records, drug prescriptions, DNA, financial information, travel data and media consumption habits of all Americans.16\n\nThe justification for this vast data collection, according to DARPA, was that \u201cthe whole population needed surveillance to prevent not only future terrorist attacks, but bioterrorism and even naturally occurring disease outbreaks.\u201d The program was defunded in 2003 after intense public backlash, \u201cbut TIA never really went away,\u201d The Defender writes.17 \u201cVarious of its programs ended up divvied into a web of military and intelligence programs.\u201d\n\nHere are a few more connections to consider when trying to decide whether a social credit system is really in the works, and why a vaccine passport could serve a central function.\n\nOracle Labs, the research arm of Oracle, is partnered with DARPA to create an \u201coptically interconnected supercomputer\u201d \u2014 something that would come in handy if putting together a massive social credit system that demands interconnectivity between thousands of databases.\n\nDARPA is also working on advanced pandemic surveillance and biological threat detection.18 In fact, it has an entire division specializing in biological technologies \u2014 the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) \u2014 which developed hydrogel, an implantable type of nanotechnology that transmits light-based digital signals through wireless networks.19\n\nIt\u2019s basically a gel-like biosensor that can both record and share biological data. The hydrogel is manufactured by Profusa, which is partnered with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation20 and backed by Google, the largest data mining company in the world.\n\nIn 2020, there were rumors that this hydrogel would be part of Moderna\u2019s mRNA delivery system.21 DARPA, by the way, actually funded Moderna too.22 However, it is unclear whether hydrogel actually ended up being used in Moderna\u2019s or any other COVID-19 vaccine. At any rate, it could be used, if not now, then in the future.\n\nNow, ask yourself, considering all of these various data points that I\u2019ve covered \u2014 which by no means includes everything \u2014 just how likely is it that a national social credit system based on digital surveillance, including medical and biological surveillance, is NOT in the works?\n\nI recently interviewed Wolf about her book \u201cThe End of America.\u201d The book, published in 2007, was a prescient warning about the very time we now find ourselves in. In it, she laid out the 10 steps toward tyranny that have been followed by virtually every modern-day would-be tyrant.\n\nThe 10 steps toward tyranny start with the invocation of a terrifying internal and/or external threat. It may be a real threat or an imagined one, but in all cases, it\u2019s a hyped-up threat. From 2001 onward, that threat was terrorism, which was used as the justification for stripping us of our liberties.\n\nThe last and final step in the implementation of tyranny, Step 10, involves the creation of a surveillance state where citizens are under constant surveillance and critique of the government is reclassified as dissent and subversive activity. Vaccine passports are clearly an integral part of that surveillance apparatus, and a precursor to a social credit system.\n\nThere simply can be no doubt of that, and if we don\u2019t put a stop to it now, we\u2019ll be locked into not just a national dictatorship but a global one, run by unelected, largely unknown individuals and Big Tech oligarchs. There will be no one to help anyone else, because all nations will be in the same boat.\n\nPeaceful Protest and Legislative Action Are the Remedy\n\nTo avoid the fate that comes next, everyone everywhere needs to recognize the danger and take action. Such action includes peaceful protest and civil disobedience \u2014 simply not complying with mask mandates, social distancing, lockdowns, vaccination or anything else.\n\nWe must also fight through legislation. As mentioned earlier, 14 U.S. states have already passed laws banning requirements for vaccine passports, which protects the freedoms of everyone within those states. While that\u2019s a good start, there are dozens more to go, and other countries need to enact such laws as well.
