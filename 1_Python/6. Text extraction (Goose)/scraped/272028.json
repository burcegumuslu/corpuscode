While the increased risk was relatively minimal, the result is the opposite of how the vaccines have been sold and mandated by government authorities.The study was reported by the Cleveland Clinic's Nabin K. Shrestha, Patrick C. Burke, Amy S. Nowacki, James F. Simon and Amanda Hagen, Steven M. Gordon.\"The association of increased risk of COVID-19 with higher numbers of prior vaccine doses in our study, was unexpected.\"The study was conducted this fall ofto see how effective the new bivalent MRNA vaccine was in preventing infections. Only 21 percent of workers received the bivalent booster which was seen to only have a 30 percent effectiveness.(Skip)(End of report.)The elderly, immuno-compromised and those with comorbities benefited from the vaccines by reduced hospitalizations and deaths. Younger, healthier individuals have seen mixed results, with many reports of side effects including myocarditis, clotting and menstrual changes. This study adds to the information about the vaccines.On December 9th, 2022, CDC expanded the use of updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 6 months-5 years.
