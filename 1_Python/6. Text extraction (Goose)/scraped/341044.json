Kennedy Jr. [the son and nephew of the slain American leaders Senator Robert F. Kennedy Sr. and President John F. Kennedy] on behalf of the Trump Transition Team (Great Again) to review Federation medical files and statistics on the child neurodevelopmental disorder known as autism, the \u201cheads/minds\u201d of the elite US mainstream propaganda \u201cfake news\u201d media establishment exploded causing them to unleash against President-elect Donald Trump one of the most vile and false stories ever created against an American leader claiming that Russia had sordid intelligence files on him\u2014and to which Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov responded to by blunting stating: \u201cThe Kremlin has no compromising information on Trump. This report does not correspond to reality and is nothing but an absolute fiction. This is a total bluff, an absolute fabrication, complete nonsense.\u201d [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report, the request made to the MoH by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Federation autism information was based upon his appointment by President-elect Trump to become the Chairman of the Golden Vaccine Safety Task Force, but who is hated and reviled by the US propaganda media establishment after his publishing a manifesto titled MERCURY & VACCINES linking childhood vaccines with autism.\n\nPresident-elect Trump\u2019s views on the linkage of childhood vaccines to autism have long been known, this report continues, such as when he stated to CNN during a May, 2016 interview:\n\n\u201cAutism has become an epidemic\u2026 Because you take a baby in, and I\u2019ve seen it, and I\u2019ve seen it, and I had my children taken care of, over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump \u2013 I mean, it looks just like it\u2019s meant for a horse, not for a child, and we\u2019ve had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, two-years-old, two-and-a-half-years-old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. \u2026I\u2019m in favor of vaccines [but] do them over a longer period of time, same amount, but just in little sections. I think you\u2019re going to have \u2013 I think you\u2019re going to see a big impact on autism.\u201d\n\nFurther to note, this report says, are the many (and growing) rumors that President-elect Trump made his decision to run for president due to his youngest child, Barron, having been diagnosed with autism immediately after receiving a childhood vaccine shot, and that his wife, Melania, has vowed to file lawsuits against anyone making such a claim\u2014but who, nevertheless, will not be moving to the White House in order to keep her child out of the \u201cmedia bubble\u201d that surrounds all US presidents and their families.\n\nTo how fanatically dishonest the US mainstream propaganda media is in protecting any American from being told about how dangerous these childhood vaccines are and how they cause autism, this report details, is constantly on display\u2014including this past week when the might of these elite propagandists was turned against one of the most respected doctors in the US, Daniel Neides, MD, the Medical Director and Chief Operating Officer of the world renowned Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, for his daring to write an anti-vaccine article\u2014that The Washington Post labeled \u201ca viral screed\u201d and that Dr. Neides was forced to apologize for, and may still be fired from his job.\n\nWhere Dr. Neides was shown the full might and power of the propaganda mainstream media in their protecting of the multi-billion-dollar vaccine industry no matter how many millions of American children get autism, however, this report continues, President-elect Trump\u2019s appointment of the anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head a new investigation into how autism is caused by childhood vaccines has caused these elites to \u201close all sense of normalcy, bordering on the insane.\u201d\n\nAnd to how actually insane these US mainstream media \u201cfake news\u201d propagandists have become, this report says, was displayed yesterday when nearly immediately after President-elect Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head his new vaccine-autism taskforce, these elites began publishing articles and giving cable news interviews alleging that Trump was caught in Russia consorting with prostitutes who he allowed to pee on him\u2014but was, in fact, a totally made up \u201cfan-fiction\u201d story lie created on Reddit.\n\nAs to why this \u201cfan-fiction\u201d story lie was created in the first place, this report explains, was due to group of pro-Trump Reddit users being angry with an anti-Trump reporter named Rick Wilson, who during an MSNBC interview referred to Trump supporters as \u201cchildless single men who masturbate to anime\u201d.\n\nAfter creating this \u201cfan-fiction\u201d story lie about Trump and his peeing Russia prostitutes, this report explains, these pro-Trump Reddit users then sent it to Rick Wilson under the cover of \u201cAnonymous\u201d\u2014and in what can only be described as \u201cyou can\u2019t make this up\u201d insanity, Wilson then sent this \u201cfake news\u201d story to the anti-Trump former CIA operative Evan McMullin, who then sent it to the George Soros funded US Senator John McCain, who then sent to the CIA, who yesterday leaked it to the leftist website BuzzFeed, and whose article has now been \u201cecho chambered\u201d throughout all the world.\n\nWant to know more? Click HERE.\n\nThis report concludes by agreeing with President-elect Trump on how vile and dishonest the US mainstream \u201cfake news\u201d propaganda media has now become\u2014and who on his Twitter page today raged about this atrocity by saying:\n\n\u201cIntelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public.
