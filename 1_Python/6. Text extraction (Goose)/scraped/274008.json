These records show that, contrary to an image of a certificate also on Phillips\u2019 Facebook page suggesting that he received a \u201cMedal of Valor,\u201d Phillips was never deployed overseas, and actually went AWOL several times, before eventually becoming a refrigerator repair technician.\n\nAll of this is undeniable, based on the records Shipley and others have unearthed, proving Phillips to be a liar. But Snopes is doubling down on the claim that Phillips never actually claimed to be a Vietnam Vet, and is continuing to try to paint him in a positive light while vilifying the Covington boys.\n\n\u201cSnopes\u2019s fact-check incorrectly labeled it \u2018unproven\u2019 that Phillips had falsely claimed to be a Vietnam veteran,\u201d writes Peter Hasson for The Daily Caller. \u201cSnopes declined to change its misleading ruling despite definitive video evidence of Phillips doing exactly that.\u201d\n\nFor more news about how the mainstream media and its lapdog \u201cfact-checking\u201d allies such as Snopes are the number-one purveyors of fake news in 2019, be sure to check out Faked.news.\n\nGoogle, Facebook both caught promoting Snopes\u2019s fake news claim that Phillips didn\u2019t lie about serving in Vietnam \u2013 making Snopes\u2019s version of events the TOP search result\n\nAlso complicit in this lying scheme to protect the phony reputation of fake Vietnam Vet Nathan Phillips are none other than Google and Facebook, both of which have propped up Snopes\u2019s \u201cfact-check\u201d lies as the top search item whenever folks try to find out the truth about Phillips.\n\nIn other words, the world\u2019s top search engine and social media platform are continuing to spread fake news about Nathan Phillips being some kind of war hero, when he\u2019s definitively been proven to be a Leftist agitator and racist fraud.\n\nDesperately trying to cover its hide, Snopes did make the following changes to its fact-check page for Phillips:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to determine at this point whether Phillips has deliberately misrepresented the nature of his service, whether he has been so vague and ambiguous in many of his descriptions (unintentionally or otherwise) that misinterpretations have entered his narrative, or whether he has tried to be accurate but may have just occasionally slipped up in his many, many hours of conversation and sometimes neglected to include the qualifiers about his service that he has used in many other videos and press interviews,\u201d an update to Snopes\u2019s \u201cfact-check\u201d now reads.\n\nBut as pointed out by Hasson, the fact-check isn\u2019t about whether or not Phillips \u2018deliberately misrepresented\u2019 his record, it\u2019s about answering the question, \u201cDid Nathan Phillips Falsely Claim He Was A Vietnam Veteran?\u201d \u2013 and the answer is yes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that Phillips falsely claimed he was a Vietnam veteran,\u201d Hasson states plainly.\n\nRead SNOPES.news for more details on the fake \u201cfacts\u201d of this discredited left-wing propaganda organization.", "opengraph": {"title": "SNOPES now a confirmed disinfo propaganda fraud after refusing to correct the facts surrounding fake \u201cVietnam Vet\u201d Nathan Phillips", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2019-01-30-snopes-now-a-confirmed-disinfo-propaganda-fraud.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "Even though it\u2019s now been 100 percent verified that Nathan Phillips, the Native American activist who provoked the Covington Catholic High School boys by banging a drum in one of their faces, did not serve in Vietnam as he\u2019s repeatedly claimed, the fake news \u201cfact-checking\u201d website Snopes continues to claim otherwise.
