The Times writer Sir James Bevan agrees, having written in a recent op-ed that \u201cdrinking recycled sewage is the future.\u201d\n\nBevan\u2019s views, by the way, are a reiteration of WEF doctrines that have been circulating for several years now. Both Bevan and the WEF agree that the world is drying up due to \u201cclimate change,\u201d and that the only way to ensure enough water for everyone is to send it from toilet back to tap.\n\n\u201cThe recent rainfall hasn\u2019t changed the underlying position in this country: many parts are likely to stay in drought for months, and if we have a dry winter then next year will be even more challenging,\u201d Bevan writes.\n\n\u201cWe will need to be less squeamish about where our drinking water comes from. Part of the solution will be to reprocess the water that results from sewage treatment and turn it back into drinking water \u2013 perfectly safe and healthy, but not something many people fancy.\u201d\n\nEPA claims that 10 areas across America are in worsening drought status\n\nAs of this writing, large swaths of primarily the American West and Southwest are under serious drought conditions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has named 10 different areas as facing drought conditions that threaten their water supplies.\n\nBevan\u2019s solution, which is also the WEF\u2019s solution, is to force everyone to drink and bathe in water that was previously urinated and defecated in before getting flushed down the toilet.\n\nBevan says people need to \u201cchange the way they think about water\u201d by agreeing to use recycled water rather than pure water from the earth.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to get there, we are all going to have to think differently,\u201d he goes on to write. \u201cSome of these measures will be unpopular, so future governments will need to show political will.\u201d\n\nThinking back to basic high school science, it is important to keep in mind that there is a fixed amount of water on planet earth. That water moves around from place to place in different forms, which can make it seem like it is \u201cdrying up\u201d in some places, but the fact remains that water is a fixed resource.\n\nWith that in mind, if there are drought conditions in one area, chances are there is an excess of water somewhere else. It is just a matter of harnessing water from wherever it is available \u2013 and after using it, allowing the earth to filter and replenish our natural resources.\n\nTo suggest that we must all start drinking filtered urine and diarrhea in order to \u201ccool\u201d the planet for a sustainable future is just more unscientific lunacy. This is about control, not preserving precious natural resources.\n\n\u201cThe entire cabal should be forced to drink this filth and eat the bugs they want to force on us,\u201d wrote a commenter. \u201cAfter they\u2019ve received all the poison vaccines they created, of course.\u201d\n\nThe latest news coverage about the WEF and the globalist agenda can be found at Globalism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "World Economic Forum-linked \u201cexpert\u201d says \u201cdrinking recycled sewage is the future\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2022-09-06-world-economic-forum-drinking-recycled-sewage-future.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "So-called \u201ctoilet-to-tap\u201d drinking water \u2013 meaning water that is recycled through the sewer system and fed back through people\u2019s taps \u2013 is going global, thanks to the World Economic Forum (WEF).
