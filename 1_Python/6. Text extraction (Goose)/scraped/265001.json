Billions of people are witnessing their formerly productive lives descend into chaos as a result of lockdowns, social distancing, and masking requirements. None of these measures appear to have much impact on the disease progression or mortality. Yet, official sources continue to issue dire warnings and additional draconian measures to \u2018stop the spread\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, citizens around the globe wonder if there is any chance of returning to normal. Their lives and those of their families depend on it. The vast majority of them are willing to do whatever they can to help everyone return to their previously productive lives. People want to know what they can do to accomplish this goal.\n\nThe problem is no one seems to be able to explain how we got to this point or what to do about restoring normal operations. In order to determine how to proceed, one must have an understanding of how we got here. Let\u2019s take a look at previous vaccination policies.\n\nThroughout history vaccines have been promoted under the banner of public health and safety. Government officials believed they were taking care of their citizens by ensuring vaccines were approved to combat diseases which posed a substantial threat to those they were elected, or appointed, to serve. The public was assured only those vaccines which were proven to be safe and effective would be approved for general use.\n\nAll of these promises gave parents a certain sense of security. Most parents went on about their business of making a living and raising their families, secure in the knowledge that government agencies would protect their children from some of life\u2019s most dreaded diseases.\n\nInitially, all seemed to be going reasonably well. Parents around the world were confident their children would no longer have to suffer the debilitating effects of polio, tetanus, typhoid, diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. Most parents were more than happy to have this weight lifted off their shoulders.\n\nUnfortunately, all did not turn out as promised. Some children suffered severe reactions after the administration of these supposedly safe, affordable, necessary and effective vaccines. Parents increasingly came to rely on the court system to help pay mounting medical bills and obtain justice for their injured children.\n\nRather than pause vaccination programs to find out what was going wrong, vaccine manufacturers chose to go to Congress and threaten to stop producing childhood vaccines because there was too much liability involved. This was enough to strike fear into the hearts of politicians. No one wanted to run the risk of being blamed for a resurgence of \u2018deadly\u2019 childhood diseases.\n\nSo, in 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Program virtually eliminating liability for the manufacturers. Over the next fifteen years or so, vaccines for seven more diseases were added to the childhood immunization schedule: Hib, Hepatitis B, Varicella (chickenpox), rotavirus, hepatitis A, pneumococcal, and influenza. Many of these vaccines required multiple doses. Vaccines became a considerable benefit to pharma\u2019s bottom line.\n\nManufacturers realized parents would only subject their infants to so many injections, so they looked for alternative ways to expand the market. In 2005, a Tdap booster was recommended for pre-teens. This was quickly followed in 2006 by a recommendation for HPV vaccines which could be administered beginning around age 11, again in multiple doses.\n\nThis turned out to be a huge mistake. Prior to recommending vaccines for teens, vaccine recipients had either been children who were primarily too young to explain how they felt after the injection or old enough that any concerns about side effects could be discounted as the effects of old age and/or senility. Teens and young adults presented a new problem. They were old enough to have a health history and perfectly capable of explaining what was going on in their bodies when they experienced adverse reactions.\n\nAdverse event reports began pouring in at an unprecedented rate. Any country where HPV vaccines were used started receiving reports of serious, life-threatening events and sometimes unexplainable deaths after administration of the new HPV vaccines. After less than ten years on the market, HPV vaccine injury reports accounted for nearly 25% of the entire U.S. VAERS database. This was no small accomplishment, considering the fact that the vaccine adverse event reporting system database had been established decades prior to the FDA approval of HPV vaccines.\n\nDespite all efforts of HPV vaccine stakeholders to minimize the problem, HPV vaccine survivors and their parents continued to speak out. They established networks where they could communicate with each other because it was abundantly clear none of the vaccine stakeholders would listen. It didn\u2019t take long for these networks to circle the globe.\n\nScientists and medical professionals began to see there was a problem and try to find answers. Who was most susceptible to adverse reactions? Why were some recipients suffering so much when others were apparently unscathed? Was there any way to determine whether the new medical conditions were adverse reactions to the vaccine? Nearly all professionals who investigated these questions were ostracized by their peers.\n\nLitigation efforts began in multiple countries. However, these lawsuits had a huge advantage over previous vaccine injury cases. For the first time in history, law firms from around the world shared information with each other. If someone needed data or an expert witness, several other firms were ready, willing and able to provide any information they had to help HPV vaccine survivors and their families obtain justice.\n\nFor the first time in history, vaccine manufacturers and stakeholders were faced with a global push-back. No matter what they did, the protests would not go away.\n\nIn spite of the global campaign against continued administration of HPV vaccines, vaccine stakeholders applied for and obtained permission to add a meningococcal vaccine to the CDC recommended schedule in 2014.\n\nWhat is wrong with this picture?\n\nThe medical industrial complex failed to consider \u2018new medical conditions\u2019 occurring after vaccine administration might be related to recent injections. The medical industrial complex failed to try to determine who might be susceptible to serious adverse reactions and why. The medical industrial complex failed to develop standardized diagnostic criteria for autoimmune conditions which are common and may occur months, or even years, after vaccine administration. Without standardized diagnostic criteria, effective treatment protocols are nearly impossible to develop.\n\nInstead, vaccine stakeholders chose to marginalize, ridicule and vilify those who suffered after vaccine administration. Terms like \u2018psychogenic, mass hysteria, all-in-your-head, faking symptoms to get attention, and on and on and on\u2026\u2019 became all too common.\n\nUsing tactics like this to ignore those who suffer and yes, even die after vaccine administration is nothing short of a crime against humanity.\n\nFor decades, parents and advocates fought to change this situation. Small battles were won along the way, but the war continued. Vaccine stakeholders appeared to be untouchable.\n\nParents trying to restore their children\u2019s health became desperate. They learned to do their own research, discover the facts and act on them. Now, parents appear to have the upper hand. They have access to the science. When they stand together, they have a phenomenal amount of strength.\n\nThe evidence is clear \u2013 vaccine stakeholders are afraid. Otherwise, there would be no effort to censor open scientific debates. There would be no effort to silence those with honest questions about vaccines. There would be no effort to hide the raw data from clinical trials. Transparency would be the rule of the day. Scientists and medical professionals would not be marginalized or punished for doing their jobs.\n\nAre we in the middle of a paradigm shift?\n\nHistorically speaking, paradigms shift dramatically when 10% of the general population changes their mind. This phenomenon has been called \u2018reaching the tipping point\u2019. Not only has that tipping point been reached, but the evidence below indicates that this proverbial \u2018tipping point\u2019 was reached quite some time ago.\n\nIn 2018, the Wellcome Trust published the \u201cWellcome Global Monitor.\u201d This was the first study ever conducted to determine public attitudes toward science and health around the world. Chapter 5 of this publication focused on public opinion regarding the safety, efficacy and usefulness of vaccines.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what their survey revealed.\n\nIt is painfully obvious to the most casual observer according to the responses in these charts, the Wellcome Trust discovered that the wheels on the vaccine income train were just a bit wobbly. What did the vaccine stakeholders do with this information?\n\nDid they take a step back and say, \u201cMaybe we have a problem with some of our vaccines or vaccination policies. Perhaps we should examine the situation a bit more closely. Maybe we need to find out why some people seem to be more susceptible to adverse reactions than others. Maybe we need to consider eliminating the susceptible individuals from future vaccination campaigns.\u201d???\n\nNo! They did not. Apparently, they decided to put forth a last-ditch effort to keep their vaccine-income train rolling along.\n\nCould the current coronavirus scare be that \u2018last-ditch effort\u2019?\n\nTake an objective look at the situation we are in right now. The vast majority of people around the world are sequestered in their homes for fear of a virus which claims the life of less than 1% of those who become infected. Rules of law and Constitutional rights, not to mention basic human rights, have been suspended around the globe for the first time in the history of mankind. Government officials are deciding which businesses and activities are essential and ordering all others to shut down to try and limit the spread of this virus.\n\nApparently, the virus can be kept out of some businesses while invading those establishments which don\u2019t have several million dollars-worth of assets without mercy. We are ordered to wear masks and maintain social distancing to help \u2018flatten the curve\u2019. Around the world, middle and low-income families are told to do their part by staying home while government officials conduct business as usual. Millions of families around the globe are facing the very real prospect of financial ruin while those issuing these draconian orders continue to receive their normal salaries and benefits.\n\nWe are told these conditions will continue until such time as a vaccine is developed for a variant of a virus that has been studied since the 1960\u2019s with no vaccine forthcoming. In all probability, by the time a vaccine is developed it will not be effective because viruses mutate so quickly. Yet, we are told the only solution to this \u2018crisis\u2019 is vaccinating virtually the entire world with fast-tracked experimental vaccines.\n\nAlthough this picture looks bleak, there is another perspective that must be understood. All of these outrageous draconian measures have opened the eyes of people on a world-wide basis. They are looking for answers. They want the truth and will accept nothing less.\n\nThe pioneers who came before us got the world to the tipping point. The corona virus scare turned that tipping point into a global tsunami of questions about vaccines and vaccination policies.\n\nThe general public is now asking questions they wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of asking a few short months ago and demanding answers to those questions.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nThe first step is to make sure people receive honest science-based answers to their questions. Ultimately, what the public does with those answers is up to them.\n\nSociety as a whole is on a precipice. There are two directions people can go. They can choose to succumb to fear and condemn the world to living under the conditions created by that fear; OR, they can choose to stand as one and build a world where manufactured fear has no place.\n\nThe world we leave to our descendants depends on the choices we make as individuals right now. Will we succumb to fear or, will we take advantage of this magic moment in time to create the world where generations to come can survive and thrive?\n\nImagine the possibilities. Standing shoulder to shoulder we can create a world where:\n\u2022 Every family affected by vaccine injury has an international support network\n\u2022 Every country has an organization that \u2018follows the money\u2019 and shines a light on the recipients\n\u2022 Scientific papers cannot be published without disclosing all raw data and all funding sources\n\u2022 Scientific and medical debates are open to the public\n\u2022 Pharmaceutical companies are held liable for the safety and efficacy of all products they manufacture\n\u2022 Governments and government agencies are not allowed to make medical decisions for their constituents\n\u2022 Pharmaceutical manufacturers are forbidden to provide funds to educational institutions\n\u2022 The medical industrial complex is forbidden to form public-private partnerships\n\u2022 Corporate influence over public health departments is not allowed\n\u2022 Should a discovery be made using public funds, the income from any patents goes back to the taxpayers\n\u2022 The FDA is responsible for food supply only\n\u2022 An independent expert organization has the responsibility for reviewing medications, biologics and medical devices to certify them safe, affordable, necessary and effective.\n\u2022 Medical professionals are allowed to care for each of their patients as individuals using whatever treatment option(s) they deem best for that patient\n\u2022 Schools are for education, not medical interventions\n\u2022 There is an international team of attorneys to protect whistleblowers to the fullest extent of the law\n\u2022 There is a cap on the amount of public funding institutions or individuals can receive in a given year\n\u2022 Any new medical condition occurring after vaccination is recorded as a potential side-effect\n\u2022 There are financial penalties imposed for failure to report suspected adverse reactions\n\u2022 There is an international network of doctors developing standard diagnostic criteria\n\u2022 There is an international network of doctors developing successful treatment protocols\n\u2022 There is an international network of scientists examining health and health-related issues\n\u2022 Medical choices are between you and your provider\n\u2022 Informed consent is mandatory for all medical interventions, including vaccines\n\nThis cannot be accomplished by any single organization. Perhaps it cannot be done by several organizations. But if everyone concerned about the current medical industrial complex stands together and supports each other \u2013 A NEW PARADIGM CAN BE CREATED!\n\nRemember to concentrate on creation. Destruction has no place in our world.\n\nIndustries which refuse to respect, protect and preserve human life will simply become obsolete under the new paradigm. Putting profit before people will no longer be tolerated.\n\nThe time has come to let the pharmaceutical industry know we will not go quietly into the night.\n\nRead this article in Spanish here.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Life after COVID 19: Where do we go from here? - SaneVax, Inc.", "description": "COVID 19: The global response to this pandemic has turned the world upsidedown.
