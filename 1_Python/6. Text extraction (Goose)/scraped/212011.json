(Related: 7 Kids in Africa left PARALYZED by vaccine-derived polio bankrolled by Gates Foundation.)\n\nThe WHO said the Burundian government declared the detection of the virus in children a national health emergency. The cases occurred in Burundi\u2019s western district of Isale, near the major urban center Bujumbura and only around a dozen miles from the border with the DRC. Samples from environmental surveillance of wastewater confirmed the presence of poliovirus type 2.\n\nIn the DRC, at least six children in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika and South Kivu were confirmed to have vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus.\n\nThese are the first internationally-recognized cases of poliovirus linked to the use of a new vaccine, the novel oral poliomyelitis vaccine type 2 (nOPV2), which was developed specifically to reduce the risk of polio in underdeveloped nations.\n\nUnlike wild poliovirus, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) causes infections when a weakened strain on the poliovirus present in oral polio vaccinations spreads among the population over an extended length of time. The last time Burundi had a cVDPV2 outbreak was over three decades ago.\n\nGates Foundation-led NGO claims more vaccines the right response to outbreaks\n\nThe non-governmental organization heading efforts to contain the outbreak is the GPEI. The GPEI is a partnership made up of the WHO, several other global health bodies and, most notably, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nWith the help of the WHO and GPEI, Burundi plans to conduct a polio vaccination campaign in the coming weeks for all eligible children up to seven years old. The DRC has scheduled a similar vaccination campaign to be led by the GPEI in April.\n\n\u201cWhile detection of these outbreaks is a tragedy for the family and communities affected, it is not unexpected with wider use of the vaccine,\u201d said the GPEI, which is also supporting local authorities in \u201cneighboring countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolio is highly infectious, and timely action is critical in protecting children through effective vaccination,\u201d claimed WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti. \u201cWe are supporting the national efforts to ramp up polio vaccination to ensure that no child is missed and faces no risk of polio\u2019s debilitating impact.\u201d\n\nThe GPEI said that its mobilization in the region will involve \u201ca thorough risk assessment\u201d and figuring out how \u201cto reduce the risk of further transmission.\u201d The NGO will also conduct mass vaccination campaigns in the region.\n\nThe GPEI noted that around 600 million doses of the new vaccine have been administered in 28 countries since it became available to the public in March 2021. The NGO continues to claim that the vaccine is safe and effective.\n\n\u201cThroughout the vaccine\u2019s extensive field use, the strains in DRC and Burundi are the only two cVDPV2 emergences detected that have been linked with nOPV2,\u201d claimed GPEI.\n\nThe organization further claimed that were it not for the new Gates Foundation-funded vaccine, there would be \u201c30 to 40\u201d more cVDPV2 emergencies in the region due to the prevalence of oral polio vaccinations (OPV).\n\n\u201cAs long as we keep using oral polio vaccine in some countries, OPV-derived viruses will continue to circulate and pose a threat to any unvaccinated people,\u201d claimed virologist Vincent Racaniello of Columbia University.\n\nDespite claims of lowering the number of vaccine-derived polio cases, the WHO has recorded more than 400 cases of cVDPV2 due to OPVs in at least 14 countries in 2022.\n\nLearn more about the harmful effects of vaccines at Vaccines.news.\n\nWatch this clip from InfoWars as host Alex Jones discusses a clip of Russell Brand exposing how Bill Gates is responsible for a vaccine-derived polio outbreak in Africa.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\n7 children paralyzed by polio virus derived from new Gates-funded polio vaccine.\n\nHundreds of thousands of children paralyzed by polio vaccines thanks to Gates Foundation\u2019s vaccination program.\n\nWHO recommends new Gates-funded polio vaccine to address vaccine-derived polio outbreak in UK.\n\nMEDICAL MADNESS: Bill Gates developing new vaccine that claims to prevent polio caused by polio vaccines.\n\nUnited Nations forced to admit that vaccines from Bill Gates are spreading polio throughout Africa.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "NaturalNews.com", "title": "Vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak in Burundi and Congo linked to Bill Gates vaccines", "url": "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-03-28-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-outbreak-bill-gates-vaccines.html", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2023-03-28T21:36:08+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-28T23:00:49+00:00", "updated_time": "2023-03-28T23:00:49+00:00", "article:section": "vaccines", "description": "Outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi have been linked to vaccines supplied to both nations by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\r\n\r\nHealth officials from both nations detected the cases and immediately informed the\u00a0World Health Organiz", "image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2023/03/Oral-Polio-Vaccine.jpg"}, "tags": ["Global Polio Eradication Initiative", "Big Pharma", "outbreak", "badhealth", "Plague", "Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation", "polio vaccines", "infections", "bill gates", "pharmaceutical fraud", "poliovirus", "Dangerous Medicine", "vaccine-derived poliovirus", "vaccine injury", "Burundi", "Democratic Republic of Congo", "badmedicine", "polio", "vaccine damage"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.naturalnews.com", "https://greatgameindia.com/bill-gates-vaccine-causes-polio-outbreak-in-burundi-and-congo/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-03-21-7-kids-africa-paralyzed-vaccine-derived-polio.html", "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burundi-declares-poliovirus-outbreak-who-says-2023-03-17/", "http://dangerousmedicine.com", "https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/103595", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "https://www.columbia.edu/", "https://vaccines.news/", "https://www.brighteon.com/5dc2ae53-48b5-4507-94bf-0aafa85516b8", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/infowarsnetwork", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/infowarsnetwork", "https://outbreak.news/2023-03-27-children-paralyzed-from-gates-funded-polio-vaccine.html", "https://vaccines.news/2022-11-10-hundreds-of-thousands-children-paralyzed-polio-vaccines.html", "https://pandemic.news/2022-06-29-who-recommends-new-gates-funded-polio-vaccine.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-04-30-bill-gates-developing-new-vaccine-against-polio-caused-by-vaccines.html", "https://newstarget.com/2020-09-08-united-nations-admits-vaccines-bill-gates-spreading-polio-africa.html", "https://greatgameindia.com/bill-gates-vaccine-causes-polio-outbreak-in-burundi-and-congo/", "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burundi-declares-poliovirus-outbreak-who-says-2023-03-17/", "https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/103595", "https://www.brighteon.com/5dc2ae53-48b5-4507-94bf-0aafa85516b8", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-03-28-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-outbreak-bill-gates-vaccines.html&linkname=Vaccine-derived%20poliovirus%20outbreak%20in%20Burundi%20and%20Congo%20linked%20to%20Bill%20Gates%20vaccines", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-03-28T21:36:08+00:00"}
