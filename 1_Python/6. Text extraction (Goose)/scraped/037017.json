For the duration of the pandemic, the state government saw the blunt approach as unnecessarily harsh to residents, preferring to rely on fabled common sense. We, the argument went, were different. Business and commerce could be left in peace, bar some tinkering on matters of social distancing.\n\nBut common sense and wily viruses do not necessarily go hand in hand; and the Delta variant of COVID-19 is proving more than a match for public health authorities. It began with an airport driver in Sydney, who caught the strain from flight crew from the US. Infections ballooned, helped along by a gathering at a birthday party of around 40 people, one of whom had unknowingly crossed paths with the driver. Those not infected turned out to be the ones who were vaccinated.\n\nWhile the critics have been, and will be noisy about the tardy reaction of the Berejiklian government in NSW, nothing can take away the dunce status accorded to the Commonwealth, whose primary responsibilities on quarantine and public health have been forfeited. This monumental debacle, a product of smugness and contentment, was bound to unfold. The building of specially adapted quarantine facilities to house arrivals from overseas was stubbornly resisted when Australia was essentially free of COVID-19. Hotel-based quarantine, run by the State governments, was deemed more than suitable.\n\nThere was also a diabolical lack of vision on purchasing a range of vaccines. All that mattered was the AstraZeneca option, billed as saviour of the nation and intended to give Australia a sovereign capability. Manufacturing it on home soil was celebrated as something visionary. But that was not to be. The roll out has been stuttered, erratic and abysmal. The blood clotting controversy, a risible communications strategy, and a worried public, has left the Morrison government floundering. Other vaccines had to be selected, and supply of these remains woeful. To date, just 7% of Australians are fully vaccinated.\n\nGetting a sense about how profound this floundering could be gathered from the way the government approached the pharmaceutical giants to begin with. What, exactly, was promised by either of the parties? On that score, the Morrison government is keeping mum, as well it might. Secrecy is often the first refuge of the incompetent, and there is much secrecy on the way the Commonwealth has been implementing its vaccine policies.\n\nFor one, the entire vaccine supply agreement with AstraZeneca has been stubbornly withheld for reasons of national security, a laughably grim state of affairs. The only thing we have to go on is the letter of intent between the government and the pharmaceutical giant, which was only released because it says nothing at all.\n\nThe ABC\u2019s 7.30 program, testing the country\u2019s feeble Freedom of Information laws, sought access to the full agreement on April 12. The answer from one Allison Jones, assistant secretary to the COVID-19 Vaccine Taskforce in the Department of Health, was a typically frail rebuke of the public interest. In refusing access to the agreement, she considered there to be \u201creal and substantial grounds for expecting that [its disclosure] would, or could reasonably be expected to, cause damage to the security of the Commonwealth.\u201d What follows is a dull regurgitation of various definitions of \u201csecurity\u201d and the \u201csecurity of the Commonwealth\u201d from various statutes, none of them vaguely applicable to discussing public health. But this technique of irrelevant spray gives us an insight on bureaucratic thought processes: that health priorities fall within the realm of the clandestine.\n\nJones cites, for instance, the definition under the FOI legislation of \u201csecurity of the commonwealth\u201d, which is \u201ctaken to extend to: (a) matters relating to the detection, prevention or suppression of activities, whether within Australia or outside Australia, subversive of, or hostile to, the interests of the Commonwealth or any other country allied or associated with the Commonwealth\u201d.\n\nThe absurd, and irrelevant definition of \u201csecurity\u201d from the Australian Security and Intelligence Act 1979 (Cth) is also thrown in for good measure. These include everything from espionage to \u201cacts of foreign interference\u201d and \u201cthe protection of Australia\u2019s territorial and border integrity from serious threats\u201d.\n\nFew clues were given as to what sort of damage could arise from making the agreement public, other than exposing the government to unalloyed embarrassment. \u201cI consider the particular damage to the security of the Commonwealth to be the fact that disclosure of the information could provide insight into the unique arrangements for the manufacture and supply of the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d Releasing the details of the contract would signal \u201cto other countries the terms agreed between the Commonwealth and AstraZeneca.\u201d What a frightening prospect.\n\nBill Bowtell, the architect behind Australia\u2019s response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, has made a spirited argument for transparency in this regard. \u201cPublic health cannot be secret health,\u201d he asserts. \u201cThe advice, proceedings and participants of all AZ meetings should be published.\u201d He makes the salient point that the deal has actually compromised national security. And no government wishes their citizens to know that.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below. Follow us on Instagram, @crg_globalresearch.
