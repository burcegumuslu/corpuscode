The only dispute is whether these spike proteins produced are harmless or harmful. But in your opinion, it is not the spike proteins that do these health damages. In fact, you say that the idea that spike proteins are produced is a kind of a chimera. What evidence is there to support your thesis?\n\nStefano Scoglio: This is scientifically evident already from the fact that it\u2019s impossible for mRNA to enter the cell and produce anything. Anybody who talks about spike proteins and embraces the story diffused by the pharmaceutical companies just accepts that as given. But nobody is reading the damned scientific literature.\n\nIn my book Apandemia: Dalla Falsa Scienza alla pi\u00f9 Grande Truffa della Storia (\u201cNo Pandemic: From False Science to the Greatest Scam in History\u201d, cover see below), I report all the scientific literature up to 2021. That is at the same time that the Corona \u201cvaccines\u201d were released.\n\nTE: Why, then, is it impossible for mRNA to enter the cell and cause it to produce spike proteins?\n\nSS: The first thing the researchers in the field state is that the living cell is a \u201cformidable barrier\u201d, very difficult if not impossible to penetrate. And then they list 5 factors that prevent the mRNA to enter cells, getting into the ribosomes where the spike protein is supposed to be produced:\n\nFirst: As soon as the genic material is injected, it is attacked by specific enzymes called extra-cellular ribonucleases, which degrade any foreign genetic material. Pharmaceutical companies claim that the lipid nanoparticles are supposed to protect the mRNA from the enzymatic attack: But nobody knows how much protection is offered. As the Pfizer \u201cvaccine\u201d injects 30 micrograms of mRNA, let\u2019s say that about half, 15 micrograms, survive.\n\nSecond: At this point, the mRNA/lipids blend has to enter the cell, supposedly through endocytosis, i.e. the cell is forming an external pouch that brings in the material. But, the researchers state, often instead of endocytosis the cell produces exocytosis, that is the pouch is used to keep the foreign material outside: Let\u2019s say that half enters and so we now have 7.5 micrograms inside the cell.\n\nThird: At this point enters the endosomes/lysosome system: all scientists in the field know that this enzymatic endocellular system attacks, degrades and eliminate at least 98 percent of any foreign material entering the cells. We are now down to 0.15 micrograms, that 150 nanograms, an infinitesimal quantity.\n\nFourth: If this were the end, you could at least claim that a very minuscule dose would enter the ribosomes. But alas, the ribonuclease enzymes are also inside the cell, they are called endocellular ribonucleases, and they would dispose very quickly of the minuscule amount of mRNA.\n\nFinally, the researchers mention a fifth element, the most important, the one that makes all the processes described so far completely useless and unnecessary. And that also explains why this material is so toxic without needing to introduce any spike protein. They indicate that these \u201cvaccines\u201d are so highly immunogenic. Indeed, they use this word immunogenic.\n\nImmunogenic means able to irritate the immune system so much that it reacts very violently. So immunogenic means highly toxic. In fact, they describe the mRNA and synthetic lipids as \u201cself-adjuvants.\u201d\n\nWhereas in other vaccines such as the ones for children, you have to introduce aluminum, for instance, to make the immune system respond. But here, you don\u2019t need to add anything because this material is as toxic as aluminum or worse. It\u2019s so highly toxic that as soon as you inject it the immune system attacks it and then it explodes into millions of nano-particles in the body.\n\nThis is actually what has been proven afterwards. Because the only study that has evaluated the biodistribution of the Pfizer Corona \u201cvaccine\u201d is a Japanese study done by the government in co-operation with Pfizer.\n\nPfizer tried to secrete this study, but it was released through a Freedom of Information Act, in short FOIA, request.\n\nAnd in this study they found that in the mice into which they injected the material, especially the lipids were found unaltered, unmodified, unchanged. That means, if they had entered the cells, they would\u2019ve been metabolized and you wouldn\u2019t have found them in the same way you have injected them. That means they have not entered into any cell, but they diffused in all organs of the body, and particularly liver, spleen, female ovary and kidneys.\n\nTE: But even Robert Malone, for example, considered the inventor of the mRNA technology or gene injections, sees the danger in the spike proteins.\n\nOr let\u2019s take the US cardiologist Peter McCullough \u2013 just like Malone a widely known critic of the Covid policy and gene injections \u2013 who recently published a study together with other researchers concluding that not only the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a neurotoxin, but the mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d are also capable of delivering the protein to the brain, increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. So how can it be possible that even these known critical scientists talk \u201cbullshit\u201d?\n\nSS: I would say that 99 percent of the scientists today talk bullshit essentially because they adopt a methodology that is bullshit methodology that has been there for a long time. Only nobody questions it.\n\nRobert Malone might have been the inventor in the 1980s, which is 40 years ago, but hasn\u2019t worked on mRNA for decades. You don\u2019t find any article of him in the last 10, 15 or 20 years. So it\u2019s not really an authority in what\u2019s been going on with that. But apart from that, the point is how do they find the spike protein in the body?\n\nIsolating a protein from the blood is a simple task. The methodology has been known since the 1980s. There are technologies, machines that you can buy and isolate proteins from the body. So we have hundreds of millions of people injected with the Corona \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nSo how much spike protein should be in the world? Like tons of spike proteins that you could actually be taken from the blood and be isolated. Did they ever do that? No!\n\nWhen they say that there\u2019s spike protein, the only way they do it is through antibody tests. And the way the antibody test is being applied is a fraud. I can also explain why it\u2019s a fraud.\n\nThey take the blood and the serum of a patient who let\u2019s say has been vaccinated. Then they test it through this ELISA antibody test and they put it in touch with a spike protein in this case. But it\u2019s a spike protein made in the laboratory. It\u2019s an artificial one, they call it recombinant spike protein. It\u2019s a synthetic spike protein.\n\nNow, the problem with antibodies is that they\u2019re really not specific. In other words: If we want antibodies to be specific, we should have like thousand or even tens of thousands of different antibodies, one for each disease. Instead, we only have five immunoglobulins, i.e. antibodies, and only two are tested: IgG and IgM. So how could you show that they are specific?\n\nWhat you\u2019re supposed to do is you take this serum from a patient, which has a lot of antibodies because this person has been vaccinated, which means he or she has been injected with a very toxic material. And the immune system has reacted by generating a lot of antibodies. So you take this serum with a lot of antibodies.\n\nThen you wanna do a proper test to see if it\u2019s specific. You take it and you put it in touch with the spike protein, with aluminum, with the original mRNA, i.e. with different toxins \u2013 and if it only responds to the spike protein you could see that it\u2019s specific. But has is this test ever done? No, it has never been done.\n\nInstead, they take the material with the immunoglobulins, they put it in touch with the synthetic spike protein. And it reacts because it reacts to any toxin, so it\u2019ll react also to the synthetic spike protein. And then they say: \u201cAh, that means there are specific antibodies for the spike protein. That means the body\u2019s full of spike protein.\u201d But it\u2019s a fraud.\n\nTE: However, a recent study shows that the spike protein from the Covid gene injections remained in a person\u2019s tissue and immune cells for months after injection.\n\nThe study examined blood samples from 50 vaccinated individuals who continue to suffer from persistent symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, or headaches for weeks or months after \u201cvaccination\u201d. These samples were compared with blood samples from 35 vaccinated individuals who had no such symptoms. And the researchers found significantly elevated levels of the spike protein in the blood immune cells of those who suffered from symptoms after vaccination. So doesn\u2019t that counter your view?\n\nSS: That\u2019s explainable. They compared people who were sick and people who were not sick. And of course, the people who were not sick did not produce a lot of immunoglobulins, that is antibodies. Whereas the sick people intoxicated by the \u201cvaccines\u201d produced a lot of antibodies. And they kept doing the antibody test. So in fact, they did not find the spike protein.\n\nThe challenge to be mastered consists of two things, though I know, of course, they would never accept it. First, isolate a spike protein as such from a \u201cvaccinated\u201d person. It\u2019s possible to do it. There are machines to do it. Why don\u2019t you do it? Why don\u2019t you take the blood and isolate the spike protein as such \u2013 and why do you do it indirectly through an antibody test instead?\n\nThe second thing is: If you wanna be a proper scientist using the antibody test and if you wanna show that it\u2019s specific for this spike protein, then test it together with other toxins and see if it is actually specific to that or if it responds to all the five toxins, which is exactly what will happen because antibodies are universal.\n\nAnd not only that. Antibodies are so efficient that they actually are able to attack any antigen, any foreign antigen, any toxin in less than an nanosecond. So they don\u2019t even need to memorize anything because they\u2019re so fast in getting anything new that arrives in less than a nanosecond which is an in unimaginable short period of time.\n\nSo all necessary things are there if you really wanna prove what is being claimed, i.e. that there is spike protein. So first, just isolate it physically from the blood. Two, if you do the antibody test, do it with the control by testing other toxins as well. Otherwise, it\u2019s all fraud.\n\nAnd to conclude: The problem with mRNA and synthetic lipid nanoparticles, like the ones where the surface has been coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), is that there\u2019s a huge literature showing that they\u2019re the most toxic material existing today on earth. They are inflammatory, they generate edema in all the membranes. They generate blood clots. They generate autoimmune reactions and lipodystrophy, i.e. a change of the subcutaneous fat tissue.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge list of what toxicologically they can do to the body. So anything that happens after \u201cvaccination\u201d doesn\u2019t need at all a spike protein as a cause. mRNA and synthetic lipids are more than sufficient to explain these health damages.\n\nTE: But someone showed me a laboratory report claiming to have found a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. On the test result it says \u201cthe Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test measures the adaptive humoral immune response against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d So what do you think about that?\n\nSS: That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. They do not measure the spike protein itself. They measure the humoral immune response. In other words, again, antibodies, immunoglobulins, that\u2019s what they test. They all do that indirectly.\n\nThat\u2019s what humoral and humeral immune response means, it\u2019s antibody tests essentially. So it goes back to what I said before. Nobody finds the spike protein as such. While, other proteins like the C-reactive proteine is tested directly. So why don\u2019t they do it with the spike protein?\n\nAnd just to add one comment. My position is more radical than whatever is proposed by the people who promote the idea of the spike protein. Because if I\u2019m right \u2013 and I think I\u2019m right because all the literature shows that \u2013 these injections cannot even be called \u201cvaccines.\u201d They\u2019re just toxic bombs. Because if they\u2019re not able to produce any viral antigen, that means they don\u2019t perform as vaccines. So they\u2019re not vaccines, they\u2019re, again, just toxic bombs.\n\nThe criticism is much more radical and goes to the fact that they knew that because as I said, all the literature up to the time when they released the \u201evaccines\u201c shows what I said, that they are not capable of entering the cell. So when Pfizer and Moderna released the \u201cvaccines\u201d they knew very well that no spike protein would be produced and they would only intoxicate people.\n\nTE: Are you alone with your view? Or is there at least a certain number of people thinking the same way you do and expressing it also?\n\nSS: I think I\u2019m pretty alone. This is actually my first international interview in this area. There are some people I know in Italy, some researchers who agree with me, but of course, we are a minority.\n\nTE: What about the other experts saying that SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses have not been proven, like Andrew Kaufman, Samantha Bailey, and so on?\n\nSS: I haven\u2019t talked to them about this. Maybe this interview will be a way of getting in touch with them and involving them in this debate. But I think I\u2019ll try at least to translate into English the section of my book that talks about this.\n\nSo there will be also the bibliographical indications of the scientific studies that I\u2019m quoting about this showing that it\u2019s not just my idea, that this is based on the literature.\n\nI have no interest in doing that differently. If there was production of spike proteins, I would probably join the group that says: \u201cWell, the spike protein is toxic and generates harms.\u201d But the thing is: When I went to look at the literature, and that\u2019s what I do, I found that this is just a fairy tale.\n\nTE: And the spike protein itself, does it exist in nature in your view, or is it definitely only an artificial lab or in vitro product?\n\nSS: It is an artificial laboratory product, absolutely. Also because the virus doesn\u2019t exist. And the virus doesn\u2019t exist because it has never been proven to exist, has never been isolated. We have made almost 250 FOIA requests around the world asking \u201ccan you show me the documentation about the isolation and therefore of the identification and therefore of the existence of the virus?\u201d \u2013 and we got the same answer 250 times: \u201cWe do not have it.\u201c\n\nTE: But regarding the virus, it is said that it has not been proven, but the particles claimed to be viruses are real. And they may be particles being produced by the body itself. So the particles claimed to be spike proteins, what are they then?\n\nSS: It\u2019s a spike protein produced in the laboratory which doesn\u2019t exist in nature because the spike protein is supposed to be a part of the virus that has never been isolated and therefore doesn\u2019t exist. So in nature, there\u2019s no toxic spike protein, it has never been found, never been isolated, never been found in the blood.\n\nAs I said before, I repeat: All they do is that they take a synthetic lab made, lab created protein that is toxic and they put it in touch with the antibodies and say that the antibodies are specific, which is just fraud, as I said before. And then they claim that therefore there must be spike protein in the body. But if the virus has not been proven to exist, there is no spike protein of the virus, either. And that\u2019s actually the case because the only spike protein existing is the one made in the lab.\n\nIn fact, sometimes I advance a challenge to the people, who support this thesis. When I then confront them with my criticism, they react by saying, \u201cOh, but there\u2019s a lot of studies showing that the spike protein is toxic.\u201d Then I say, \u201cjust go and read them!\u201d The truth is that there are only studies on the recombinant spike protein, on the protein made on the laboratory.\n\nSo again, the challenge is to find this spike protein directly in the blood. If this has been done, then we talk. But such a thing has not been done yet. There\u2019s not a single study of this kind. It\u2019s only indirect through antibodies and an artificial spike protein. It\u2019s always the recombinant protein made in the lab, mainly in Chinese labs.\n\nTE: Regarding the lipid nanoparticles that you say are the actual toxic component, fact checkers of the German television network ARD reported that a study showed that these lipid nanoparticles in fact caused inflammation in mice, but that the nanoparticles studied are not identical to the ones used by BionTech and Moderna in their mRNA \u201cvaccines.\u201c And therefore, as an expert named Gregor Fuhrmann, quoted by the ARD, said, one should be cautious about drawing conclusions about other vaccines.\n\nAlso, the study was on mice, so the results cannot be directly transferred to humans, as Fuhrmann who is a full professor of pharmaceutical biology at the university Nurnberg-Erlangen adds. Moreover, local inflammation may well be desirable in a vaccination.\n\nSS: I could agree with professor Fuhrmann, but then we would have to close toxicology. In other words, toxicology should be closed tomorrow because toxicological studies are always done on animals. Why don\u2019t they do it on humans? Why don\u2019t inject poison on humans to test it?\n\nWell, they\u2019ve done it with the Corona \u201cvaccines.\u201d But, in terms of toxicological studies, the standard is animal studies because the idea is that if something is toxic to the body of an animal, it may be toxic to a human, too. There are parameters like the safety reduction standard. So when you use a dose on a mice, then you reduce that by a factor of 10 because of inter species variation.\n\nThese are mechanisms to transfer the effect on an animal to that on a human. That\u2019s the standard of toxicology. If you don\u2019t accept that, then toxicology should close tomorrow.\n\nAnd the other thing is: I would ask this Mr. Fuhrmann: If the toxicological studies on animals are not valid \u2013 which, as mentioned, would actually mean that toxicology has to be closed tomorrow \u2013 why would the study that Pfizer did on the new omicron \u201cvaccine\u201d and which has been done on eight mice should be valid?\n\nIn fact, that shouldn\u2019t be valid, either. Moreover, it is not just the lipid nanoparticles that are toxic, the mRNA is toxic in itself as well. In fact it is more toxic than the lipids.\n\nTE: So what, in your view, is the hardest evidence that the lipid nanoparticles are toxic?\n\nSS: There are a lot of studies in literature showing that PEG and the other lipid nanoparticles are toxic. It\u2019s in the literature, done on mice or other animals because you don\u2019t do toxicological studies on humans by definition.\n\nTE: recently, a globally unique study has been published showing that the toxic components, mainly metal elements such as cesium, barium, titanium, and aluminum, are contained in all samples of of covid gene injections from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna. And another ingredient of concern mentioned by critics of these gene injections is graphene oxide.\n\nBut the European Medical Association EMA writes us that \u201cit has not seen any credible evidence from its evaluations or from ongoing testing that any Covid-19 vaccine is contaminated with graphene oxide, which is not a recognized excipient in medicines.\u201c What is your knowledge about graphene oxide?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t exclude that besides this two very toxic components that are declared, i.e. synthetic mRNA and synthetic lipid nanoparticles, that there may be something else.\n\nWe had the Japanese government sent back 4 million doses of Moderna because they found particles of steel in the vaccine, though this may be also due to contamination. So it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s something else.\n\nBut other toxic components are not necessary to explain the toxicity, as I said, because synthetic mRNA and synthetic lipids are enough to explain all the toxic results of these \u201cvaccines.\u201d But there may be something else, may be some other metals.\n\nAs to graphene oxide, I tend to be suspicious in the sense that I believe that so far there\u2019s no credible evidence of the presence of it. I\u2019ve seen studies by a few researchers like the ones from Spain or other researchers doing dark field microscopy. And dark field microscope is a very good tool. I use it, too.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m a certified dark field microscopist among other things. And in fact, you can see the blood that is like rotten. You can see these images of blood really reduced and with a lot of blood clots and a lot of dark material. It looks really bad after you have been vaccinated with these \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nBut the thing is, that in the studies from the Spanish researchers and from the ones from Italy that I saw dark particles have been found that look like graphene oxide, that resemble graphene oxide. But this is not a conclusive finding. These results from Spain are saying that they tested the presence of graphene oxide also with a vibrational methodology and that the vibration of this thing seemed to correspond graphene oxide as a whole.\n\nBut here we\u2019re entering a field that is not really solidly scientific anymore. And why do we need to get into this very shaky ground so that we are more liable to being accused of being charlatans or anything like that? We don\u2019t need that.\n\nIf you really wanna work on graphene oxide, take the blood, take the particles that are dark and test them chemically to find if it\u2019s graphene oxide or not. You cannot come up by saying \u201cOh, it looks like graphene oxide,\u201d and then everybody is saying, \u201cOh, there\u2019s graphene oxide in the vaccine.\u201d This is not the way it should work. It\u2019s not a serious way of proceeding.\n\nTE: There are also fears that \u201cvaccinated\u201d people are contagious. Biomedical expert Philippe Van Welbergen, for example, recently claimed that unvaccinated have graphene and nanoparticles in their blood that are transmitted by people who have received the gene injections against Covid. Are fears that\u201cvaccinated\u201d people are contagious justified?\n\nSS: No, they\u2019re not contagious because for one thing, since there\u2019s no production of spike protein, how can they be contagious to anybody else? And again, there\u2019s no proof that there\u2019s graphene oxide in these Covid injections. And all these stories about the graphene being a transmitter and so forth are all in the stage of storytelling, but there\u2019s not really anything substantial that has come out yet. Furthermore, I personally I don\u2019t believe in the contagion theory in general.\n\nTE: But Van Welbergen is also referring to the nanoparticles. So, again, can something toxic from the \u201cvaccines\u201d transmit from the vaccinated person to another person?\n\nSS: No. In fact, all the scientific literature explains that these nanoparticles, they\u2019re deposited. An example is the mentioned Japanese biodistribution study that showed that lipid nanoparticles are deposited in all the organs and that it\u2019s very difficult for the body on its own to take them out of the organs and the tissues where they are stuck. So they cannot be transmitted to anyone.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ve seen people getting sick after getting close to a \u201cvaccinated\u201d person. But who are these people? People who listen to people who are saying that the \u201cvaccinated\u201d people are contagious. They get into paranoia and two days later they\u2019re sick. Why? It\u2019s the mind.\n\nThank you, Stefano, for this conversation.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThe interview first appeared on Transition News.\n\nDr Stefano Scoglio is an expert in microbiology and naturopathy, coordinating scientific and clinical research on Klamath algae extracts and probiotics in collaboration with the Italian National Research Center and various universities.
