When considering the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval, the disparity emerged two months earlier.\n\nPfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine performed worse than Moderna\u2019s, the researchers wrote. \u201cThe upper bound of the 95% CI was consistently greater than 1 starting at 3 months after second dose\u201d for the former and six months for the latter.\n\nBy contrast, the odds ratios for either vaccine never got close to 1 for the Delta variant, even for the upper bound.\n\nEven as evidence of the short-lived efficacy of the COVID mRNA vaccines continues to mount, federal regulators stepped in Tuesday to block doctors from using monoclonal antibodies to treat COVID patients. The FDA on Monday revoked authorizations for two such treatments against Omicron infections, including the one used by then-President Trump, finding they were \u201chighly unlikely to be active\u201d against the now-dominant variant.\n\nThe little-noticed findings in the JAMA study were highlighted by law professor Todd Zywicki, whose natural immunity lawsuit prompted George Mason University to grant him a medical exemption from its vaccine mandate.\n\n\u201cStill more confirmation that Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s CEOs know what they are talking about when they state that 2 doses of vax provides insignificant (at best) protection against Omicron,\u201d Zywicki tweeted Tuesday.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla said earlier this month that its vaccine offers \u201climited if any\u201d protection against Omicron, while Moderna\u2019s preliminary booster data showed \u201clow neutralizing antibody levels\u201d against the variant before boosting.\n\nBoth have promised Omicron-specific vaccines this year. On Tuesday, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced a clinical study of such a vaccine among healthy 18-55 year-olds.\n\nPerhaps the most vaccinated country in the world, Israel, appears poised to double down on boosters after a government advisory committee recommended a fourth dose for all adults, the Associated Press reported Tuesday.\n\nNearly half its population has received at least one booster, and the government started offering a second booster last month to those over 60.\n\nOne Israeli study found increased antibodies but not further protection against Omicron in twice-boosted healthcare workers, while another found such elderly people were \u201cthree times more resistant to serious illness\u201d than the single-boosted, the New York Post reported.\n\nOmicron is \u201cnot just an incremental shift of a variant, as Delta was from Alpha, but a fundamentally different challenge,\u201d Zywicki wrote in an email. People can \u201cpretend like the vaccines are still providing protection\u201d simply because the variant is relatively milder.\n\nWhile the JAMA study emphasizes the benefits of boosters against Omicron relative to either not getting vaccinated or two doses, researchers conceded that \u201cthe higher odds ratios for Omicron suggest less protection for Omicron than for Delta\u201d among the boosted.\n\nThey studied about 23,000 COVID cases, mostly Omicron, among adults who were tested Dec. 10-Jan. 1 by a \u201cnational pharmacy-based testing program.\u201d Twice as many controls were used. (Omicron now accounts for nearly 100% of infections.)\n\nMost of the tests were performed in the 25-44 age range, three-quarters were white, and a third \u201creported underlying health conditions.\u201d\n\nResearchers only counted vaccinated individuals who received the two-dose series at least six months earlier, and boosted individuals who received the third jab at least six months after the second.\n\nThe adjusted odds ratio of symptomatic Omicron infection for boosted versus unvaccinated individuals was 0.33, and for boosted versus two-dose recipients, 0.34. That means three doses corresponded with an \u201cestimated effectiveness\u201d of 67% over no doses, and 66% over two doses.\n\nThe study confirms that \u201cOVERALL vaccine efficacy is zero,\u201d Zywicki told Just the News: The first few months of protection \u201crapidly approaches zero\u201d around the six-month mark and then goes negative for a few more months.\n\nHe said the JAMA study was the fourth to find \u201cbasically this same negative [vaccine efficacy] effect\u201d that he documented in an Epoch Times op-ed on \u201coriginal antigenic sin.\u201d\n\nZywicki highlighted research from Toronto, California and Denmark that found negative VE starting two to six months after vaccination. The California study was \u201cslippery,\u201d he claimed, because \u201cthe authors appear to have simply arbitrarily set a floor of zero vaccine efficacy.\u201d\n\nThe law professor\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of epidemiology measurement is inadequate,\u201d the California study\u2019s lead author, epidemiologist Hung Fu Tseng, wrote in an email. \u201c[A]lthough the odds ratio can be over 1, and 1-OR could be negative, the VE (or it\u2019s confidence interval) can not be negative. There is no mathematical meaning of a negative percentage.\u201d\n\nThe CDC disputed Zywicki\u2019s interpretation of its JAMA study.\n\n\u201cWe see that 2 doses vs. unvaccinated against symptomatic infection with Omicron wanes to a number that is not distinguishable from 0 (i.e., our estimates even when negative are not significantly different from 0),\u201d spokesperson Kristen Nordlund wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cSo protection against infection wanes to something undetectable, but we do not see that the risk of infection is increased,\u201d she said. Nordlund also said the adjusted odds ratios were \u201cnot distinguishable from each other\u201d because their confidence intervals overlapped.\n\nThis response amazed Zywicki. \u201c[T]he CDC is admitting that vaccine efficacy is indistinguishable from zero from omicron?\u201d he wrote. \u201cYeah we are going to put people through the risk of adverse side effects for two shots of vaccine that they acknowledge is at best zero in six months?\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CDC Study Suggests Unboosted Vaccines Become Worse Than Nothing Against Omicron", "description": "(Greg Piper) Agency confirms \"protection against infection wanes to something undetectable,\" while maintaining that \"we do not see that the risk of infection is increased\" after lapse of protective window.", "url": "https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2022/01/cdc-study-suggests-unboosted-vaccines-become-worse-than-nothing-against-omicron/", "site_name": "Stillness in the Storm", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/stillnessinthestorm", "article:published_time": "2022-01-26T17:52:05+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-27T14:58:58+00:00", "image": "https://stillnessinthestorm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1237086663.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["covid vaccine", "cdc", "news", "Just TheNews", "video", "useless vaccine"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here is the Pfizer CEO clip saying his company\u2019s two dose covid vaccine provides \u201climited, if any\u201d protection against omicron. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@twitter</a> needs to explain what the copyright claim is here.
