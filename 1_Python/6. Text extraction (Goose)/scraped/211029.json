This molecule is created automatically, at zero cost, when broccoli sprouts are sprouted using something as simple as a mason jar and a sprouting lid.\n\nThe molecule is called sulforaphane, and it\u2019s found in all cruciferous vegetables. But its highest concentrations (by far) are found in broccoli sprouts.\n\nSulforaphane is just one of many \u201cneuritogenic\u201d molecules that are known to regenerate nerve tissue and help repair damaged brains. Given that mRNA spike protein vaccines cause direct damage to neurological and vascular systems, sulforaphane may represent one of the most important, promising natural molecules to help repair and restore brain damage in vaccine victims.\n\nGreenMedInfo.com has done extensive research on sulforaphane and other natural molecules. Their list of neuritogenic substances, found at this link, shows all the following substances exhibiting documented neurological repair capabilities:\n\nGreen Med Info has also published an overview of sulforaphane and its brain repair mechanisms as documented in published science. From that story:\n\nThe researchers determined the optimal concentration range of sulforaphane in promoting neural stem cell (NSC) growth without harming neurons. The researchers determined that \u201cConcentrations of less than 5 mM did not induce cytotoxic e?ects, but rather potentially promote the growth of NSCs.\u201d\n\nThe term 5 mM means 5 milli-molar which is a reference to the concentration of sulforaphane in blood. 5 milli-molar is 5 thousands of a Mole. A Mole is a set number of molecules in one liter of a solution, regardless of molecular weight.\n\nAlthough this depends a lot on body weight, we think it wouldn\u2019t require much consumption of broccoli sprouts to achieve 5 mM concentrations in the blood of a person.\n\nWhen neural stem cells were exposed to sulforaphane, they transformed into neurons\n\n\u2026exposing NSCs to sulforaphane resulted in their differentiation [into] neurons, lending powerful support to the hypothesis that sulforaphane could stimulate brain repair.\n\nThis means that sulforaphane is a kind of molecular \u201cactivator\u201d that causes neural stem cells to become neurons. This is how damaged brain cells are regrown.\n\nAnd for anyone who thinks you can\u2019t grow brain cells, you already did it once. Your entire brain was grown from nothing, in your mother\u2019s womb. A similar process grew your heart, lungs, bones, nerve cells and so on. Every human body knows how to regrow nerve cells. Otherwise, humans wouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nHow to grow your own sulforaphane for mere pennies\n\nBecause God and Mother Nature gave us all the medicine we need, you can \u201cmanufacture\u201d your own sulforaphane for mere pennies and literally transform air into sulforaphane through the use of broccoli sprouts.\n\u2022 Buy broccoli sprouts, a mason jar and a sprouting lid (see image below).\n\u2022 Put about a tablespoon of broccoli spouting seeds into a mason jar, rinse with water, affix the sprouting lid and turn it upside to drain the water.\n\u2022 Keep the sprouting jar upside down. Once a day, rinse with water and drain.\n\u2022 In a few days, you have broccoli sprouts with loads of sulforaphane.\n\nYou can then eat the sprouts, use them in salads, blend them into smoothies, drop them into soups or whatever you want to do. Sulforaphane is a very robust molecule and it\u2019s somewhat difficult to destroy, so don\u2019t think you have to treat it like a delicate, fragile substance. Blending sprouts does not destroy their molecules. That\u2019s because these molecules are very, very small.\n\nIn my podcast, below, I reveal a tip for how to multiply the sulforaphane production by up to 10 X by spraying your sprouts with a low-cost source of sulfur. While broccoli sprouts create sulforaphane from the air by grabbing carbon, oxygen and nitrogen from atmosphere, they need a source of sulfur, which is absorbed through roots.\n\nSee GrowYourMedicine.com for more coverage of ways to grow your own medicine.\n\nSulforaphane also exhibits powerful anti-cancer properties. GreenMedInfo lists the best properties of this molecule as reflected in published medical literature. It shows that sulforaphane is documented to help with:\n\n\u2026 and many other conditions.\n\nSulforaphane is one of my top five molecules from nature. Resveratrol is another one, and vitamin D is No. 1.\n\nRemember: Everybody can make unlimited quantities of sulforaphane for nearly free. No person needs to wait for a doctor\u2019s permission to grow and eat broccoli sprouts. You don\u2019t need health insurance coverage or a visit to the (toxic) pharmacy.\n\nEven better, corrupt, pharma-infested governments of the world can\u2019t take away your broccoli sprouts unless they go full tyranny and start banning seeds. Even then, seeds are pretty easy to hide from government thugs.\n\nLearn more in today\u2019s eye-opening podcast about healing vaccine-induced brain damage and nerve damage:\n\nFind my information-packaged podcasts each day, along with special reports and emergency updates, at:\n\nAlso follow me on:\n\nJoin the free NaturalNews.com email newsletter to stay alerted about new, upcoming audiobooks that you can download for free.\n\nDownload my current audiobooks \u2014 including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind \u2014 at:", "opengraph": {"title": "Bombshell: Can vaccine NERVE DAMAGE be REVERSED with this home-grown molecule called sulforaphane?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2022-01-28-can-vaccine-nerve-damage-be-reversed-with-this-home-grown-herb-sulforaphane.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "A molecule found in home-grown sprouts is documented to activate nervous system stem cells to regrow nerve tissue and repair damaged nerves and brains.
