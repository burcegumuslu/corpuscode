The data comes directly from reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\nVAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed.\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS makes public all vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date, usually about a week prior to the release date. Today\u2019s data show that between Dec. 14, 2020 and May 14, a total of 227,805 total adverse events were reported to VAERS, including 4,201 deaths \u2014 an increase of 144 over the previous week \u2014 and 18,528 serious injuries, up 1,338 since last week.\n\nThis week\u2019s data showed 943 total adverse events, including 23 rated as serious, among 12- to -17-year-olds.\n\nIn the U.S., 268.4 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of May 14. This includes 115 million doses of Moderna\u2019s vaccine, 144 million doses of Pfizer and 9 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID vaccine.\n\nOf the 4,201 deaths reported as of May 14, 23% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination, 16% occurred within 24 hours and 38% occurred in people who became ill within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\u2022 20% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 44% were female and the remaining death reports did not include gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 74.7 and the youngest deaths reported include two 15-year-olds (VAERS I.D. 1187918 and 1242573 ) and a 16-year-old (VAERS I.D. 1225942). There were other reported deaths in children under 16 that could not be confirmed or contained obvious errors.\n\u2022 As of May 14, 1,140 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 351 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 2,275 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 51% were reported after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations, 42% following vaccination with the Moderna vaccine and 192 cases, or 10%, of Bell\u2019s Palsy cases were reported in conjunction with J&J.\n\u2022 There were 195 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome with 40% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 38% to Moderna and 26% to J&J.\n\u2022 There were 65,854 reports of anaphylaxis with 38% of cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, 51% to Moderna and 11% to J&J.\n\u2022 There were 3,758 reports of clotting disorders and other related conditions. Of those, 1,468 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 1,093 reports to Moderna and 1,093 reports to J&J.\n\nCOVID vaccines may not work for millions with underlying conditions\n\nAs The Defender reported May 19, some experts are questioning the CDC\u2019s recommendation that immunocompromised people get vaccinated after new research showed 15% to 80% of people with underlying health disorders and those on immunosuppressive medications mount few, if any, antibodies to COVID vaccines.\n\nYet, current CDC guidelines indicate those with compromised immune systems should be vaccinated for COVID even though \u201cno data are available to establish COVID vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups\u201d as people with compromised immune systems or those who take immunosuppressants for a medical condition were largely excluded from vaccine clinical trials.\n\nDr. Meryl Nass, an internal medicine physician, said it\u2019s the responsibility of the CDC to determine the risks and benefits of every vaccine for different groups of people. For COVID vaccines, Nass said, the CDC has failed to publish that information, or tell the public which groups might be at a higher risk of suffering an adverse reaction that far outweighs any potential benefit.\n\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "opengraph": {"image:width": "610", "image:height": "405", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CDC Data
