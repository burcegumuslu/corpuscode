Now evidence is emerging that covid-19 vaccine makers hid side effects in order to get vaccines to market faster. Myocarditis, blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and deaths among the vaccinated are skyrocketing, and an eminent cardiologist is reporting that mrna vaccines may alter human genetics.\n\u2022 In a November 24 interview with Action4Canada, Dr. Peter McCullough, the former vice chief of internal medicine at the Baylor University Medical Center, revealed that m vaccines may alter human anatomy, even \u201cchanging the human genome.\u201d\n\nNew technology: Normal vaccines used inactive or killed pathogens to prompt human cells to start manufacturing antibodies against those pathogens. The covid-19 vaccine is different. It is the first-ever mrna vaccine, meaning it uses a specialized sequence of ribonucleic acid to hijack a human cell\u2019s protein-making machinery and instruct it to start manufacturing coronavirus proteins\u2014specifically the protein that gives the coronavirus its crown-like appearance.\n\nAdverse effects: When the vaccine was released, Tal Brosh, head of the Infectious Disease Unit at Samson Assuta Ashdod Hospital, assured people that it did not change people\u2019s genetic code. Instead, he said, mrna molecules acted more like a usb device inserted into the human body, running a certain program without altering the \u201chard drive.\u201d But scientists still have no real idea what the full consequences of injecting people with experimental mrna will be.\n\nYet Dr. McCullough believes there is evidence that the \u201cusb\u201d does alter the \u201chard drive\u201d through a process called \u201creverse transcription.\u201d\n\nThe covid-19 vaccines, as they exist, are not sufficiently safe and not sufficiently effective for use in human populations. It looks like they do permanently install into the human genome through what we call reverse transcription. So this is disturbing that not only does the vaccine not get out of the body, but now they\u2019re changing the human genome. This is shown in the human hepatoma cell line. And so, it\u2019s conceivable that two vaccinated people could actually pass the code for Pfizer or Moderna into the baby permanently.\n\n \u2014Dr. Peter McCullough\n\nMass formation psychosis: Dr. Robert Malone, one of the architects of mrna technology, agrees with Dr. McCullough that mrna vaccines are not safe for use in the human population. He also believes the U.S. government acted lawlessly when it approved these vaccines, but people went along because lockdowns made them susceptible to \u201cmass formation psychosis.\u201d According to Dr. Malone, this mental condition occurs when people have \u201cbecome decoupled from each other and have free-floating anxiety\u201d because they can\u2019t make sense of what is happening. \u201c[T]hen their attention gets focused by a leader or series of events on one small point, just like hypnosis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere. They will follow that person. It doesn\u2019t matter if they lie to them or whatever.\u201d\n\nLearn more: The Trumpet has written much more clearly and powerfully about the causes of mass formation psychosis.
