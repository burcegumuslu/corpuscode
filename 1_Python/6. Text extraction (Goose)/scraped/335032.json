Speculation is swirling that VP Mike Pence will himself invoke this 10-day investigation on January 6th, refusing to open and read the electoral votes from swing states until this 10-day investigation is complete.\n\nThere is historical precedent for exactly this sort of investigation, and Pence has plenary power to invoke this himself, needing no approval from anyone else. Should he do so, it would likely push the inauguration day beyond January 20th, which is perfectly fine with the Twelfth Amendment, which states that the inauguration can be as late as March 4th in cases of a contested election.\n\nThe commission would reportedly consist of five members of the House, five from the Senate and five US Supreme Court justices. Unless this group is chosen to include patriots like Sen. Hawley, Sen. Cruz, Justices Thomas and Alito, Rep. Mo Brooks and similar, a group of 5 Representatives + 5 Senators + 5 SCOTUS justices sounds like 15 filthy traitors in a smoke-filled room, ready to betray the republic by burying all the evidence.\n\nSo unless this commission is carefully crafted, it\u2019s going to be obvious from the start that it\u2019s all a ruse. And that will set off the pro-America patriots who have had enough of bogus investigations, waiting for Bill Barr to do something useful, or sitting around hoping that deep state swamp creatures might one day face arrest for their crimes against the United States.\n\nToday\u2019s Situation Update for January 3rd examines this new development and many other stories:\n\u2022 Why abortion was the leading cause of death in 2020.\n\u2022 Pope Francis is \u201cthe entity\u201d and the Vatican covers up pedophilia and child sacrifice.\n\u2022 How the D.C. mayor closing local hotels before the Jan 6th Trump rally is yet another act of extreme censorship against conservatives and Trump supporters.\n\u2022 Why Leftists are the malicious bullies who deny conservatives any right to speak, or work in corporation America, or practice religion or even get a hotel room.\n\u2022 Why patience is running out for many conservatives, and why a day of reckoning is coming for intolerant, fascist Leftists.\n\u2022 We need a whole new \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d for military tribunals of treasonous deep state actors, Big Tech CEOs, fake news journo-terrorists and all the other evil, malicious actors who are trying to destroy America and enslave humanity.\n\u2022 Mitt Romney unhappy with the speed of the mass vaccinations that will kill people. Romney would have no doubt been unhappy with the Nazi regime\u2019s efficiency of mass extermination via Zyklon-B.\n\u2022 VP Pence now welcomes GOP senators challenging the election fraud in swing states. (He has flipped back to the pro-Trump side.)\n\u2022 Jerome Corsi believes the outcome of this election will go way past January 6th and perhaps take until January 20th to sort out.\n\u2022 Wild claims of 220,000 \u201csealed indictments\u201d are probably nonsense.\n\u2022 Trump says more US senators will join the currently list of objectors.\n\u2022 Georgia GOP reveals their case filed on Dec. 4th, is still not even assigned to a judge. DELAY, DELAY, DELAY. The criminality of the courts is exposed.\n\u2022 If the courts will not hear any election fraud case on its merits and now claim no jurisdiction over any election fraud, it\u2019s that a green light for all future elections to be determined by wholesale ballot printing and stuffing operations? SCOTUS says cheating is fine! District courts, too. Cheat away!\n\u2022 Trump tweets in legal language, issuing official declaration that the Georgia general election and runoff elections are both \u201cillegal and invalid.\u201d This is specific legal language, not merely the usual Trump banter.\n\u2022 Two foreign spy agencies have proof of massive election fraud in the USA. We believe it\u2019s Israel and Russia. Israel is turning over this evidence to Trump\u2019s team.\n\u2022 What will happen when Trump is confirmed the winner: Left-wing cities erupt into mass violence.\n\u2022 Special Forces intel says operators are pre-positioned in Dem-controlled cities and will use civilian rental vans to launch targeted extractions and arrests of top Antifa and BLM terrorist leaders.\n\u2022 SOF units are already in place in Dem-controlled cities. Dem mayors and governors are also on the arrest list if they interfere. This is why Ted Wheeler in Portland has suddenly flipped against Antifa. He likely got word that his own arrest was imminent.\n\u2022 Liberal \u201cjournalist\u201d Kurt Eichenwald fantasizes about beating antimaskers to death, but we wonder how exactly he plans to accomplish that when he has first been \u201cventilated\u201d in self-defense.\n\u2022 Fauci the fraud reveals that coronavirus vaccines don\u2019t prevent infections but rather were designed merely to mask symptoms of covid. This is an open admission that the vaccines are a total fraud, and that the vaccine industry\u2019s antibody theory has been completely abandoned by the vaccine propagandists themselves.\n\u2022 Prepare for left-wing guerilla warfare in the Untied States with a possible duration of a few months. Expect infrastructure disruptions and spontaneous killings of Trump supporters. Prepare for defense.\n\nHear the full Situation Update here, including a horrible rendition of Mitt Romney speaking German like a crazed Nazi:\n\nA new Situation Update is posted every day, including weekends and holidays, at:", "opengraph": {"title": "Situation Update, Jan. 3rd \u2013 Senators announce 10-day emergency investigation into election fraud, Pence likely to invoke on the 6th", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2021-01-03-situation-update-jan-3rd-senators-10-day-emergency-investigation.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "A dozen U.S. Senators have signed on to a demand for an emergency 10-day elections investigation commission that would dive into all the known allegations of election fraud and produce a final report.
