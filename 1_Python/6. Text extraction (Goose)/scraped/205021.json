Even after vaccines became widely available,\u201d Hotetz said. \u201cAnd now the anti-vaccine activism is expanding across the world, even into low- and middle-income countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a killing force,\u201d he continued before making a number of bizarre and unsubstantiated claims about the scope of the \u201ckilling\u201d caused by \u201canti-science\u201d sentiment. \u201cAnti-science now kills more people than gun violence, global terrorism, nuclear proliferation or cyber attacks,\u201d Hotetz claimed. \u201cAnd now its become a political movement. In the U.S. its linked to far extremism on the far-right, same in Germany. So this is a new face of anti-science aggression.\n\n\u201cAnd so we need political solutions to address this issue,\u201d the video concluded.\n\nOn Twitter, the video was promptly \u201cratio\u2019d\u201d to the tune of 3,715 replies compared with just 2,425 likes as of Sunday, December 18, 2022.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s video comes as a number of studies continue to raise questions over risks and injuries associated with COVID-19 vaccines. A group of scientists recently conducted a risk-benefit analysis which showed that getting a COVID-19 \u201cbooster shot\u201d is at least 18 times more dangerous than catching the virus itself for young people under the age of 30, Lifesite News reported.\n\nFurthermore, Japanese researchers recently found that COVID-19 vaccination increases the risk of developing myocarditis across all age brackets.\n\nRELATED: Peer Reviewed Study: 94 Percent of Vaccinated Patients With Subsequent Health Issues Have Abnormal Blood\n\nRELATED: Government Responsible for 86% of New Jobs In Canada Since Pandemic Began", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "WHO: Vaccine Skeptics Are 'A Major Killing Force Globally'", "description": "A new social media campaign from the World Health Organization (WHO) labels vaccine skeptics as a \"major killing force globally.\"", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/who-vaccine-skeptics-are-a-major-killing-force-globally/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-12-18T21:42:36+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WHO-Video-Killing-Force.jpg", "image:width": "720", "image:height": "405", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID-19 Vaccines", "Vaccines", "World Health Organization"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAnti-vaccine activism, which I actually call anti-science aggression, has now become a major killing force globally.\"<br/>\u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterHotez?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PeterHotez</a>, Professor and Dean <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BCM_TropMed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BCM_TropMed</a>, on the devastating impact of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/misinformation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#misinformation</a> and disinformation. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZluiMGJ2gX\">pic.twitter.com/ZluiMGJ2gX</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1602991915808456705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 14, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://twitter.com/PeterHotez?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/BCM_TropMed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/misinformation?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/ZluiMGJ2gX", "https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1602991915808456705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/covid-boosters-18-times-more-dangerous-for-young-people-than-the-virus-itself-study-finds/?utm_source=popular", "https://nationalfile.com/study-covid-19-vaccination-poses-elevated-risk-of-myocarditis-death-across-all-age-groups/", "https://nationalfile.com/peer-reviewed-study-94-percent-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood/", "https://nationalfile.com/report-government-responsible-for-86-of-new-jobs-in-canada-since-pandemic-began/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/world-health-organization/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-12-18T21:42:36+00:00"}
