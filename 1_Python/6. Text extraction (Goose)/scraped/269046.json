Since this initial push, other member states have proposed their own amendments and the total number of proposed changes now sits at 307.\n\nThese proposed amendments give the WHO new powers to declare \u201cpotential\u201d health emergencies and include commitments from member states to recognize the WHO as the \u201ccoordinating authority\u201d during certain types of health emergencies.\n\nThey also outline how the WHO intends to use its new powers to push global vaccine passports when it declares \u201cpotential or actual\u201d health emergencies.\n\nThe current version of the IHR already allow the WHO to issue recommendations to \u201creview proof of vaccination,\u201d \u201crequire vaccination,\u201d and \u201cimplement tracing of contacts of suspect or affected persons.\u201d\n\nHowever, these proposed amendments to the IHR greatly expand on the existing recommendations and lay out a framework for digital vaccine passports and other forms of digital tracking.\n\nNew text has been added that allows member states to require \u201cdocuments containing information for a lab test in digital or physical format\u201d and \u201cinformation on vaccination against a disease.\u201d\n\nAnother amendment states that \u201cdocuments containing information concerning traveller\u2019s destination\u2026should preferably be produced in digital form, with paper form as a residual option\u201d and suggests that this will be used for contact tracing.\n\nOne amendment paves the way for \u201cother types of proofs and certificates\u201d which \u201cmay be designed by the Health Assembly\u201d (the WHO\u2019s decision-making body) and will be used to \u201cattest the holder\u2019s status as having a decreased risk of being the disease carrier. These other proofs include test certificates (which provide proof someone has been tested for a disease) and recovery certificates (which provide proof someone has recovered from a disease).\n\nNot only do these proposed amendments to the IHR push for post-Covid vaccine passports, digital proofs, and digital certificates but they also state that \u201cvaccination certificates should be considered approved\u201d when the WHO has declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and there\u2019s \u201ca scenario of voluntary vaccination using products still at the research phase or subject to very limited availability.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, they mandate that digital health documents \u201cincorporate means to verify their authenticity via retrieval from an official web site, such as a QR code.\u201d\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t end there. These proposed amendments also lay out a \u201cminimum\u201d and \u201cmaximum\u201d scenario for the data to be collected via this proposed vaccine passport and digital certificates scheme.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["World Health Organization"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://reclaimthenet.org/world-health-organization-global-vaccine-passports", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://reclaimthenet.org/topics/world-health-organization", "https://reclaimthenet.org/vaccine-passports/", "https://reclaimthenet.org/world-health-organization-pandemic-treaty-a-fresh-push-for-vaccine-passports-global-surveillance-and-more", "https://reclaimthenet.org/who-target-misinformation-disinformation-international-law", "https://reclaimthenet.org/world-health-organization-global-vaccine-passports"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 2, 2023"}
