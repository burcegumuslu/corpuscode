It is being carefully crafted to avoid having to include Congress while still allowing maximum power and authority to be handed over to the globalists.\n\nIn her announcement, Hamamoto specified that the final agreement cannot include \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities,\u201d calling such an idea \u201cnot appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to seeking common ground to best ensure universal application while also ensuring capacities are strengthened so that countries can meet their obligations,\u201d she said, adding that the final agreement \u201cmust stand the test of time while building on the lessons from previous pandemics\u201d in order for the U.S. and the WHO to \u201cbuild a strong global health architecture for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, the Pandemic Accord must stand the test of time while building on the lessons from previous pandemics,\u201d her announcement concludes. \u201cBy creating solutions that are flexible and adaptable, by laying out commitments that are clear regarding triggers and responsibilities, and by strengthening coordination and capacities, together we can build a stronger global health architecture for all.\u201d\n\nIf ever there was a blatant act of treason by this corrupt regime, this is it. Biden and his cronies are no longer even trying to hide their true intentions for America, which include sacrificing the Constitution on the altar of \u201cpublic health.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll treaties require congressional approval,\u201d one commenter emphasized about the absolute lawlessness of this regime. \u201cJoebama is not following the law again.\u201d\n\nMore news coverage about Biden\u2019s assault on medical freedom can be found at Tyranny.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden regime surrenders U.S. sovereignty to WHO \u2013 no more medical freedom, especially during a \u201chealth emergency\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2023-03-06-biden-surrenders-us-sovereignty-who-health-emergency.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "Thanks to fake president Joe Biden, Americans are losing their medical freedom.
