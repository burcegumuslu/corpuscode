I know folks who are working in completely full pediatric units and full hospitals, even though they used to think it didn\u2019t affect children that badly. And I also have a healthy friend who is actually an epidemiologist who contracted it, and she has had long-COVID, including everything she eats tasting rotten for months so far. It may seem like \u201cjust a cold and then it will be over\u201d but it also has the potentially to be much worse. I personally know someone who developed a rapid advancing lung disease after having covid and died in two weeks.\n\nI think overall for me, the long-lasting KNOWN possible effects of contracting the virus (permanent lung damage, mental fog, taste/smell, neurological problems, death) far outweigh the possible effects of the vaccine, which, so far, has not actually lent to very many issues, and no death. Many of the side effects people are reporting are also effects that you can see if you actually get COVID, but worse. For example:\n\nThere have been 594 confirmed reports of myocarditis or pericarditis after over 180 million people have received at least one dose. These cases are generally mild, and there have been NO fatalities.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 causes myocarditis at a significantly higher rate than vaccination. One study has shown that up to 60% of recovered hospitalized COVID-19 patients have evidence of myocarditis. It has also been seen in patients with mild symptoms. A recent study at the Ohio State University showed that 15% of collegiate athletes with COVID-19 had evidence of myocarditis.\n\nThings with very low chances like Guillan-Barre are a factor in every vaccine, and affects a very very small number of people. I would look into some visual charts comparing the number of people vaccinated to those with severe side effects if that helps.\n\nThese people put out some great content on fact checking and myth debunking. https://www.instagram.com/unbiasedscipod/?hl=en\n\n They helped put the \u201cblood clots\u201d concern in perspective. I face a higher risk of blood clots due to birth control meds I took for a decade than the J&J vaccine that was a cause for concern earlier this year. https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnVC8_D1cG/", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The BioLogos Forum", "type": "website", "image": "https://discourse.biologos.org/uploads/db1313/original/2X/f/f961c6c80e26b70ee0d1d6cc9465706f024563cf.jpeg", "url": "https://discourse.biologos.org/t/should-i-risk-getting-vaccinated/46568?page=2", "title": "Should I risk getting vaccinated?", "description": "Vaccine data suggests that any long-term side effects are known within about 3 months.
