Using a highly \"experimental approach\"[7] Its first interim analysis was based on 95 cases, of which 90 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 5 cases observed in the mRNA-1273 group. Based on these interim safety and efficacy data, Moderna submitted for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and with global regulatory agencies, which prepared the path to several hundred million people being injected.\n\nThe product contains 40 trillion mRNA molecules in each injection. Each mRNA \u201cpackage\u201d is designed to be absorbed into the body's cells. The packages open, the genes are released, the body then gets to work reading these genes and manufacturing trillions and trillions of COVID spike proteins.[8]\n\nOn 26 August 2021, Japan suspended use of the Moderna COVID vaccine over concerns of contamination.[10], after two men died. The men, 30 and 38, died within days of receiving their second shots on Aug. 22 and 15, respectively.[11] Since deaths after COVID vaccines are hardly uncommon[12], the recall is unusual.\n\nThe official story is that the 3 lots of the Moderna Covid vaccine doses were recalled because they had a stainless steel contamination related to friction between two pieces of metal in the instrument used to put stoppers in bottles. Moderna\u2019s domestic distributor in Japan, Takeda Pharmaceutical, who conducted the investigation itself, declared \u201cstainless steel is routinely used in heart valves, joint replacements and metal sutures and staples. As such, it is not expected that injection of the particles identified in these lots in Japan would result in increased medical risk,\u201d[13] but this is disingenuous, since even according to its own standards, the death of the men presumably is related to the metallic micro-particles.\n\nEarlier in 2021, a Spanish study claimed to have found Graphene oxide in the vaccines. While the study should be treated with caution - it been strongly questioned[14] - the contamination with \"black particles\" certainly has some relevance for it. In May 2021, protein contaminants were found it the AstraZeneca vaccine.[15] A few weeks later, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that he would be resigning.\n\nThere might also be more to the story in other ways, as Japan has been a laggard in the global COVID-19 agenda.\n\nSuspended use in Finland for men under 30 due to side-effects.[16]\n\nA truck transporting Moderna vaccine doses for Ghana had an accident in West Virginia in August 2021.[17][18][19][20] Cassandra Fairbanks for Timcast reported that a hazmat team from the Department of Defense took over the cleanup of the accident site.[21][22][23] \"Fact checkers\" rated their reporting half true.[24][25]", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/4/41/Moderna_vaccine.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies":
