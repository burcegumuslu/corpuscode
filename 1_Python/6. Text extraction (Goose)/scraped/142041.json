With such high disregard for human life, how many ethical lines have to be crossed before the WHO is finally investigated?\n\nLet's face it: the only real justification for using vaccines to \"immunize\" ourselves against disease is derived from the natural fact that when challenged by infectious agents the humoral arm of our immune system launches a successful response capable of conferring lasting immunity. Were it not for the elegance, proficiency, and mostly asymptomatic success of our recombinatorial immune system in dealing so well with infectious challenges, vaccination would have no scientific...\n\nScientists claim the XMRV is nothing to worry about. Perhaps you agree. Now is the time to take a look at the evidence presented by these scientists who declare there is no relationship between XMRV and disease. You may want to reconsider.\n\nPLAGUE: Brought to You with the BEST of Intentions! Is there a relationship between the burgeoning epidemic of chronic diseases and the vaccine trials that took place decades ago? Is there a hidden truth that could change the way we treat these diseases?\n\nThe evidence against vaccine safety and effectiveness is massive. Here is a 300+ page research download of National Library of Medicine abstracts showing there are over 200 adverse effects of the vaccines in the CDC schedule, including death.\n\nDespite aggressive pressure to get girls as early as 9 years old to vaccinate against HPV, a new analysis shows that natural HPV infection actually prevents new HPV infections and cervical changes linked to cancer malignancy.\n\nAttacking Ourselves: Top Doctors Reveal Vaccines Turn Our Immune System Against Us The research is hard to ignore, vaccines can trigger autoimmunity with a laundry list of diseases to follow. With harmful and toxic metals as some vaccine ingredients, who is susceptible and which individuals are more at risk?\n\nThe medical establishment got it all wrong: it is not vaccine-exempt children who endanger us all, it is the effects of prolonged mass-vaccination campaigns that have done so.\n\nDr. Judy Mikovits Joins GreenMedInfo Advisory Board \u2013 Welcome to the Revolution! GreenMedInfo is honored to welcome Dr. Judy Mikovits to the team as she continues her search for absolute truth within the scientific community. As a true scientist, Dr. Mikovits believes it is her duty to seek truth at any cost, and we gladly stand by her side.\n\nHalf of the U.S. adult population is simultaneously both against abortion and for a vaccine schedule that uses induced abortion derived fetal cells. How can such an extreme form of moral hypocrisy be maintained by millions without virtually any discussion?\n\nFor those paying attention, there are serious concerns to our current vaccination schedule in America. In a previous post I gave 8 of those that I felt were important enough for me to not vaccinate my daughter. In this article we look at 8 more reasons. Do any of these resonate with you?\n\nIf the Gateses and the Faucis and the representatives of the international medical establishment get their way, life will not return to normal until the entire planet is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe Microbiome and the Vaccine Industry New awareness of the microbiome is driving the vaccine industry to factor microbes in vaccine response. But the industry is ignoring the microbiome as factor in adverse events.", "opengraph": {"image": "//cdn.greenmedinfo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ogimage/Vaccine_19.jpg", "title": "Vaccination: Hexavalent", "type": "website", "url": "https://greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-hexavalent"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/blog/healing-vaccine-injuries-through-homeopathy", "/blog/healing-vaccine-injuries-through-homeopathy", "/gmi-blogs/jthomas", "/blog/whos-private-vaccine-laboratory-developing-world", "/blog/whos-private-vaccine-laboratory-developing-world", "/gmi-blogs/christina.england.btinternet.com", "/blog/vaccination-agenda-implicit-transhumanismdehumanism", "/blog/vaccination-agenda-implicit-transhumanismdehumanism", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/plague-update-xmrv", "/blog/plague-update-xmrv", "/gmi-blogs/kentheckenlively", "/blog/plague-brought-you-best-intentions", "/blog/plague-brought-you-best-intentions", "/gmi-blogs/kentheckenlively", "/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20Research%20Group", "/blog/hpv-vaccine-maker-s-study-shows-natural-hpv-infection-beneficial-not-deadly", "/blog/hpv-vaccine-maker-s-study-shows-natural-hpv-infection-beneficial-not-deadly", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/attacking-ourselves-top-doctors-reveal-vaccines-turn-our-immune-system-against-us", "/blog/attacking-ourselves-top-doctors-reveal-vaccines-turn-our-immune-system-against-us", "/gmi-blogs/celestewriter", "/blog/herd-immunity-myth-or-reality", "/blog/herd-immunity-myth-or-reality", "/gmi-blogs/vaccineillusion", "/blog/dr-judy-mikovits-joins-greenmedinfo-advisory-board-welcome-revolution", "/blog/dr-judy-mikovits-joins-greenmedinfo-advisory-board-welcome-revolution", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/pro-life-and-pro-vaccine-ultimate-hypocrisy", "/blog/pro-life-and-pro-vaccine-ultimate-hypocrisy", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/episode-59-human-retroviruses-chronic-illness-scientific-prejudice-0", "/blog/episode-59-human-retroviruses-chronic-illness-scientific-prejudice-0", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/8-more-reasons-i-haven%E2%80%99t-vaccinated-my-daughter-2", "/blog/8-more-reasons-i-haven%E2%80%99t-vaccinated-my-daughter-2", "/gmi-blogs/jamesprimarycare", "/blog/future-vaccines-video1", "/blog/future-vaccines-video1", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/studies-find-flu-shots-can-harm-your-heart-infant-and-fetus", "/blog/studies-find-flu-shots-can-harm-your-heart-infant-and-fetus", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/newsweek-op-ed-absurdly-lies-vaccination-entails-no-health-risks", "/blog/newsweek-op-ed-absurdly-lies-vaccination-entails-no-health-risks", "/gmi-blogs/JeremyHammond", "/blog/microbiome-and-vaccine-industry", "/blog/microbiome-and-vaccine-industry", "/gmi-blogs/Keith%20Bell"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
