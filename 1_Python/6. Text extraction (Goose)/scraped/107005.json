Renowned Astrologer, Claudia Vannini reads your Eluxe horoscope\n\nIf you love Eluxe horoscopes as much as we do, why not get your personal birth chart done?\n\nFor more Eluxe horoscopes, a personal or daily reading, astrological chart or \u2018karmic\u2019 reading of your personality, contact: pegadaastrologica@gmail.com. Follow Claudia on Instagram here.\n\nThe first Eclipse of the year arrives\u2026with everything, everywhere, all at once!\n\nIt affects Pluto and brings the opportunity for big changes. This Eclipse marks the end of a theme. And as a result, each sign will face some kind of challenge. Know yours by reading your month\u2019s prediction. Take the opportunity to deal with your challenge with wisdom and good humour.\n\nOn May 5th, we have another eclipse, this time in Aries. At this time, you will have enough energy to renew your life. It\u2019s time for closure. Leos, Cancers, Aries and Scorpios will feel the movements of the Sun most strongly.\n\nOn April 3rd, Mercury enters Taurus. The Planet affects the realm of wealth and finances. You thought the banks were insecure before? At this time, they can succumb to even more pitfalls and scandals!\n\nLooking for better news? A beautiful day is April 11th. The Sun and Jupiter, set in Aries, replenish our hope for better days. On that day, Venus enters Gemini. All romantic relationships based on intellectual interactions will thrive on this day, but relationships based on sexual attraction alone will falter.\n\nBetween the 16th and the 19th, we enter the astral holidays. The Planets are not interested in us. It\u2019s a well-deserved rest, before a very strong Eclipse. And, on the 20th, the Eclipse happens in a square with Pluto.\n\nHold on tight. This event has a very destructive tone and facilitates the announcement of wars and conflicts. Soon after, the Sun enters Taurus. We must pay close attention to the financial oscillations of the Chinese market and the movements made by Russia and Iraq.\n\nBetween April 21st and May 15th, Mercury enters the retrograde phase. As always, avoid elective surgeries and protect your electronics. Cars also often fail. Drive carefully and back up your files. Confirm your airline tickets and hotel reservations. Do not send sensitive messages without keeping a copy. Imagine that no one understands what you say; don\u2019t make assumptions. Always be clear and double check for clarification.\n\nTake advantage of this busy month in the astral plane, but without Eclipses or retrograde planets.\n\n3rd \u2013 Gibbous Moon in Virgo \u2013 time to persevere in a theme\n\n17th \u2013 Balsamic Moon in Pisces \u2013 conducive to healing, forgiveness and breaking up\n\n27th \u2013 Waxing Moon in Leo \u2013 there are no guarantees, persist\n\nA good month to all! Enjoy every moment of this wonderful planetary adventure and be happy on Earth!\n\nRead your Sun Sign and Rising Sign, too.\n\nPS: Directly from the WORMHOLE by Claudia Vannini \u2013 March, 8th, 2017\n\nA new virus appears in the near future and frightens all continents. It is new, it is lethal and can be a mutation of H5N1, with transmission between humans. There is no vaccine and creates impediments in international travel and chaos at airports with body temperature control and use of masks for protection.\n\nThe region where it all begins is China, Korea, Japan, Philippines. It affects a major international sports event such as the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchan. There is no relation with the Japanese Virus influenza.\n\nRead my Monkeypox foresight published by the Telegram group, on June, 2020\n\nI asked today not to see any diseases. I want to see good things. I was here deep in emails and I saw those huge prickly pimples on some skin like it was smallpox.\n\nThe month\u2019s Eclipse moves your social group and your past. Friends can be a big disappointment. Don\u2019t get upset. Better to know who is really on your side. You might feel like you need to break away from some institution like a sports club or church. In short, the month brings a major cleanup in your social sector. Release all grudges. Finances are fine, but you feel like taking risks. Not just in investments, but also in your love life. You\u2019re seeking excitement and adventure. That\u2019s fine, but be careful not to do so around the time of Mercury\u2019s retrograde.\n\nDid you strengthen your social group last month as I advised? If so, good! This month\u2019s Eclipse puts the focus back on to the Self. It\u2019s the ideal time to change your look/image. Buy new clothes, cut your hair, do aesthetic procedures or whatever it takes to renew your appearance. Your finances were stable last month, but this month, they also deserve some newness. This could mean looking for a new job or finding a second source of income. Afraid? Don\u2019t be! These will be welcome changes. This month promises good profits and novelty every day. There is no rest. Your health is still strong, but slow down on the day of the Eclipse. And be careful that love doesn\u2019t get out of hand! You can fall in love with someone unusual. Singles and married people experience unprecedented affective situations. GOOD DAYS: 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 25, 28, 29", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Eluxe Horoscopes For April 2023", "description": "Horoscopes Eluxe Magazine, Claudia Vannini, monthly horoscopes, free horoscopes, astrology readings by Claudia Vannini, astrological readings", "url": "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/eluxe-horoscopes/", "site_name": "Eluxe Magazine", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EluxeMagazine?ref=br_rs", "article:published_time": "2023-03-31T06:11:47+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-30T02:53:28+00:00", "image": "https://eluxemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/horoscope-2019.jpg", "image:width": "686", "image:height": "450", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/EluxeMagazine?ref=br_rs"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://astro-charts.com/tools/new/birth-chart/", "mailto:pegadaastrologica@gmail.com", "https://www.instagram.com/pegadaastrologica/", "https://humix.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffindyourfate.com%2Fhumix%2Fvideo%2F1eff318d22bf6e0bf236dd04e087c4e6eafd5c0e43add19427bd9fb723c305c0", "#abh_about", "#abh_posts", "https://eluxemagazine.com", "https://www.facebook.com/EluxeMagazine?ref=br_rs", "https://twitter.com/eluxemagazine", "https://eluxemagazine.com", "https://eluxemagazine.com", "https://go.skimresources.com/?id=88703X1541792&xs=1&isjs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fchere-di-boscio-56b2a1b%2F&xguid=01CXZQKRMG8R5WKD9TJS0C61E9&xuuid=8b7711adf522c99deb05fe5ce8f4e688&xsessid=&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=https%3A%2F%2Feluxemagazine.com%2Fabout%2F&xtz=-480&jv=13.12.1-stackpath&bv=2.5.1", "https://eluxemagazine.com", "https://eluxemagazine.com/author/chere/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/win-a-natural-tanning-kit-by-le-beach/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/eluxe-horoscopes/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/fashion/jewellery/ethical-engagement-rings/"], "authors": ["Chere Di Boscio"], "publish_date": "2023-03-31T06:11:47+00:00"}
