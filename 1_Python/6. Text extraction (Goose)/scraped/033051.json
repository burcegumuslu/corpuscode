But with black residents lagging the overall population in vaccinations, the rules are disproportionately affecting a minority group usually in step with Democratic policies. The schism came to a head on Monday, when Black Lives Matter of Greater New York launched a protest outside a restaurant where enforcement of the policy sparked a melee.\n\nHawk Newsome is a black activist and co-founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York \u2014 one of the many prominent Black Lives Matter organizations outside the hierarchy of the Black Lives Matter Global Network. He founded the group with his sister, Chivona Newsome. Both siblings spoke at the Monday protest, where Hawk accused the city of using vaccination requirements to run cover for its \u201cracist ways\u201d and \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d\n\nNewsome spoke with the Washington Examiner about the difficulties vaccine-hesitant blacks are facing in the era of medical passports.\n\n\u201cWe are not anti-vaxxers. Some of us are vaccinated,\u201d Newsome said of his group. \u201cIt\u2019s an individual\u2019s choice. No one should be forced to put something in their body.\u201d\n\nThe number of black residents in New York City who have not been vaccinated is drastically disproportionate to other racial groups. More than 70% of black people in New York City aged 18 to 44 have not gotten the injection \u2014 a statistic touted by Chivona at the Monday protest. There is a variety of reasons for the lag in shots, including religious beliefs and distrust of the government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s black people who have a natural distrust of the vaccine,\u201d Newsome said. He cited the Tuskeegee Syphilis Study as an example of historic exploitation of black people by the U.S. medical community, despite the fact that vaccines are accessible to people of all racial groups.\n\nBLMGNY is advocating for the complete abolition of vaccine requirements, not only in the city but also on a national level.\n\n\u201cI think, in a perfect world, [vaccine requirements] should be business by business. But it could be a slippery slope, so the mandate should be removed completely,\u201d Newsome said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be white men in suits on Wall Street who are gonna get stopped. There\u2019s such hypocrisy in this thing.\u201d\n\nNewsome, a Baptist, said that what infuriates him the most is the lack of accommodations for an individual\u2019s spiritual objections to the vaccine.\n\n\u201cHow dare they remove religious exemptions? It\u2019s the most disrespectful thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cNow the government has decided your God doesn\u2019t matter? I love God.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, three black women were taped attacking the waitress at Carmine\u2019s Italian Restaurant, after which they were arrested and charged with instigating a fight. The women allege that the waitress used racial slurs against them that provoked them, but no recording of such an altercation has been made public thus far. The owner of Carmine\u2019s, Jeffrey Bank, denied that his hostess used racist language while asking for proof of vaccination.\n\n\u201cThree women brutally attacked our hostess without provocation, got arrested and charged for their misconduct, and then, over the last several days, had their lawyer falsely and grossly misrepresent their acts of wanton violence in a cynical attempt to try to excuse the inexcusable,\u201d Bank said in a statement.\n\nRegardless of Bank\u2019s explanation, protesters, including both Newsome and his sister, took to the streets against the restaurant and the city\u2019s vaccine mandates.\n\nA Black Lives Matter protester was recorded shouting at a member of the community anti-crime group \u201cGuardian Angels\u201d during the protest. The unidentified man, who was wearing a black tank top and mask, repeatedly shouted \u201csuck d***\u201d in the face of Patrol Lead for the Guardian Angels Joshua Penner, 77WABC News reported.\n\nBLMGNY is not new to controversial political demonstrations, and neither is Newsome.\n\nFollowing the death of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, which sparked several nationwide demonstrations and led to former police officer Derek Chauvin being convicted on murder charges, Newsome said if the United States doesn\u2019t \u201cgive [black people] what they want,\u201d they would \u201cburn this system down,\u201d while refusing to clarify whether his statement was literal or figurative. At one point in the Fox News interview, Newsome also referred to Jesus Christ as \u201cthe most famous black radical revolutionary in history.\u201d\n\nNewsome insisted to the Washington Examiner that his group isn\u2019t \u201crunning to the Right\u201d in critiquing the Democratic leadership in New York.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a follower of Malcolm X,\u201d Newsome said, calling the historic black activist the greatest civil rights leader in U.S. history. \u201cMalcolm X didn\u2019t trust the Republicans, but he also didn\u2019t trust the Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we agree with the Right? No,\u201d he continued, adding that he cannot align with the GOP because he believes their platform is built around the oppression of black people. However, Newsome believes that black communities are being intentionally left out of discussions about vaccine hesitancy by left-wing politicians.\n\n\u201cIt fits a narrative to say crazy Trumpsters are the only ones who don\u2019t want to take the vaccine,\u201d Newsome said.\n\nAt a protest Monday in front of New York restaurant Carmine\u2019s, Chivona Newsome, also a co-founder of the group, said of the vaccine mandates, \u201cWhat is going to stop the Gestapo, I mean the NYPD, from rounding up black people, from snatching them off the train, off the bus?\u201d She further issued the threat that BLM was \u201cputting this city on notice that your mandate will not be another racist social distance practice\u201d and that \u201cBlack people are not going to stand by, or you will see another uprising .\u201d She said vaccine verification \u201cis not a free passport to racism.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "New York BLM Threatens Uprising Against Racist Vaccine Passports", "description": "\"It's not gonna be white men in suits on Wall Street who are gonna get stopped.
