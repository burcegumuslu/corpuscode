What would you do?\n\nThat\u2019s the startling premise of last year\u2019s most unconventional Christmas movie, Silent Night (2021). Now available for streaming on Amazon Prime and at Apple\u2019s iTunes store, the film offers a shrewd indictment of both mindless secularism and authoritarian science.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s the perfect Christmas movie for the COVID era. (Warning: Spoilers ahead, including how the film ends!)\n\nLike many Christmas stories, this holiday film centers on a group of family and friends who gather at someone\u2019s house for Christmas. The setting in the British countryside is picture perfect, suitable for a Hallmark movie or a House Beautiful photo shoot. But hints are soon dropped that something is seriously amiss, and we eventually learn why: A monstrous cloud of poisonous gas is headed to Britain, scheduled to arrive early Christmas morning. According to the government, everyone exposed to it will die horrific and agonizing deaths.\n\nNot to worry \u2014 helpful government officials have come up with solution, a \u201cfinal\u201d solution, you might say: \u201cexit pills\u201d for everyone except the homeless and illegal immigrants. The pills promise a painless \u201cdeath with dignity\u201d \u2014 or so the government\u2019s public service announcements constantly tell people on their mobile devices. \u201cAvoid suffering. Take your exit pill and die with dignity,\u201d a neutral middle-aged female voice advises.\n\nStarting out as a dark comedy, Silent Night gets progressively more somber as it explores life and death, the freedom to choose for oneself, and the tyranny of experts speaking in the name of science.\n\nThe focal point for much of the film is the boy Art (played by Roman Griffin Davis, the real-life son of writer/director Camille Griffin) and his onscreen parents Simon (Matthew Goode) and Nell (Keira Knightley), the hosts of the Christmas gathering.\n\nArt is frustrated that the adults won\u2019t discuss the impending disaster. He tells his parents and the other adults that they don\u2019t need to pretend before their children, because \u201cwe\u2019ve seen the news.\u201d What did Art and his fellow children learn from the \u201cnews\u201d?\n\nA girl named Kitty (Davida McKenzie) suggests that the poison cloud must have been sent by Russia \u2014 because everyone knows \u201cthe Russians want us all dead\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re obsessed with world domination.\u201d Art and his two brothers express exasperation at what they regard as Kitty\u2019s stupid claim.\n\nIt\u2019s not Russia, they tell her, \u201cit\u2019s the planet\u2026 It\u2019s very upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, the planet\u2019s absorbed everyone\u2019s filthy rubbish, and it\u2019s had enough. It can\u2019t take it anymore, so it\u2019s spitting it back out,\u201d says Art. And why does he think that?\n\n\u201cGreta warned us!\u201d he says passionately. \u201cShe missed all that school. She spent weeks seasick. She even met Leonardo DeCaprio! And still, no one listened to her!\u201d\n\nIn case you can\u2019t tell, this is pure mockery \u2014 mockery of standard progressive talking points.\n\nIn interviews, the film\u2019s writer/director Camille Griffin has made clear she regards herself as part of the secular left. \u201cThis is a pro-socialist film,\u201d she says unabashedly, explaining that her intended targets of scorn included \u201cRepublican Conservatives\u201d and those who supported Trump.\n\nYet \u201cRepublican Conservatives\u201d and Trump supporters aren\u2019t the ones who have idolized child environmental activist Greta Thunberg. It\u2019s to Griffin\u2019s credit that much of her film skewers the obsessions and pretensions of her own class and social set rather than just taking potshots at the conservatives she so despises. Unlike an overrated filmmaker like Oliver Stone (whose one-sided sermonizing easily becomes trite as well as tedious), Griffin is no propagandist. \u201cI just wanted to ask questions with the film,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to give the answers.\u201d\n\nThe result is an unflinching portrait of the hollowness of secular liberalism. The characters Griffin has created are ultimately difficult to like. They are a muddle-headed bunch who don\u2019t seem to believe in anything other than their own personal needs and physical comfort. Truth, courage, thinking for yourself, self-sacrifice: These are alien concepts in their social set.\n\nSo is the reality of God. One of the most powerful aspects of the film is the way it counterposes the music and words of religious Christmas carols (yes, including \u201cSilent Night\u201d) with the characters\u2019 empty secularism.\n\nTo be sure, the characters still deploy the cultural vestiges of religion, but they don\u2019t really believe what they are saying. At one point, Nell tries to get her foul-mouthed son to temper his swearing by telling him: \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas, darling. What would baby Jesus say?\u201d Even her son knows the comment is vacuous and so pays no attention. At another point, Simon agrees to say grace over dinner. However, he doesn\u2019t know how to begin. \u201cWhere to start?\u201d he mumbles. \u201cGod,\u201d his wife answers dryly. Simon then stumbles through a series of meaningless platitudes.\n\nTo invoke C. S. Lewis in The Abolition of Man, the characters in this movie are \u201cmen without chests\u201d \u2014 people without rightly trained sentiments grounded in anything above themselves. Even liberalism\u2019s lowest-common denominator commitment to \u201cself-determination\u201d doesn\u2019t bind them. Since physical pain is the ultimate evil, their conclusion that everyone must take the exit pill is regarded as an iron consensus from which no one is allowed to dissent.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is take our pills and choose not to suffer,\u201d Simon tells his son Art. When Art responds that \u201cWe have a choice\u201d not to take the pill, his father quickly retorts: \u201cNo, no. We don\u2019t have a choice. No.\u201d\n\nLater, Art has an even more emphatic exchange with his father, leading him to realize that his father doesn\u2019t even believe in God:\n\nAs Art becomes increasingly disillusioned by the pat answers offered by his parents and the government, he begins questioning more and more what he\u2019s been told, culminating in a discussion with the adult James (Sope Dirisu), a seemingly kindly cancer doctor, whose own wife Sophie (Lily-Rose Depp) doesn\u2019t want to take the \u201cexit pill\u201d because she is pregnant. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill my baby,\u201d she insists.\n\nThe boy tells James that he doesn\u2019t plan to take the pill either, and James first tries to frighten him into submission. \u201cPain\u2026 is intolerable,\u201d he tells Art. \u201cWell I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not taking it,\u201d Art replies stubbornly. He then enters into a remarkable dialogue with James that pushes back against the pretensions of both the government and its scientists.\n\nWhen Art suggests that perhaps some people may have survived the gas cloud, James dogmatically replies with utter confidence: \u201cNot one single being has survived.\u201d But Art is no longer cowed by adults making assertions they can\u2019t back up, so he responds: \u201cSays who?\u201d The doctor\u2019s answer is telling:\n\nArt goes on to say his math teacher once made a mistake and was called on it by a student. The math teacher refused to believe he was wrong and berated the student. But later the teacher discovered he really had made a mistake, and he apologized.\n\nJames patronizingly responds by suggesting that unlike math teachers, top scientists are above error: \u201cThis isn\u2019t pretend, Art. There isn\u2019t someone somewhere who\u2019s made a mistake.\u201d\n\nArt sensibly replies: \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally know they made a mistake until they\u2019ve made it, and then we\u2019ll all be dead, and then there won\u2019t be anyone to apologize to.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the film, it has become apparent that the adults are the real children in this tale of woe. They don\u2019t take responsibility. (\u201cWe just want to make sure that you understand that as your parents, we are not to blame\u2026 this is not our fault,\u201d they tell their children.) They don\u2019t demonstrate independence of thought. They don\u2019t question. They don\u2019t value anything above the avoidance of pain. They don\u2019t support the freedom of others to make their own choices. And they don\u2019t have courage.\n\nBy contrast, when Art discovers that James\u2019s wife Sophie doesn\u2019t want to take the pill, he offers to stay with her so she won\u2019t die alone when the poisonous cloud comes.\n\nCourageous though he may be, even Art understands that in the natural order of things, he needs the care and protection of adults. For me as a father, the film\u2019s most moving scene is when Art begs Simon to join him in not taking the exit pill. \u201cPlease, Dad, stay with me,\u201d Art implores. \u201cWe can hide from the poison together. We can \u2014 we can shut the windows, and we can barricade the doors, and we can wait it out. Please, Dad, I need a grown up. I can\u2019t do it on my own.\u201d\n\nBut Simon isn\u2019t moved, not even by entreaties from his son. The scene is heart-rending.\n\nWhen the poison cloud is about to arrive, Simon and another father don\u2019t seem quite ready to follow through with mass suicide. But the voice of science intervenes in the character of the medical doctor James. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he tells the other men; and they commence the process of killing themselves and their families. James\u2019s own wife still doesn\u2019t want to die, so he emotionally manipulates her to get her to take the suicide pill along with him. So much for self-determination.\n\nSimon, Nell, Art, and his brothers play out their own drama. Earlier in the film, Art had gone outside and was exposed to a poisonous twister that came before the main cloud. He first seems fine, but they check on him again and his face is now bloody \u2014 seemingly confirming the government\u2019s claim that \u201cfatal hemorrhaging\u201d is the final result of exposure to the cloud. Terrified, Simon and Nell hurriedly rush the rest of their family to take their suicide pills.\n\nThe menacing cloud finally engulfs the house in the night. The next morning, a new day dawns. The poisonous cloud is gone. The countryside is peaceful again with new falling snow. Inside the house, dead bodies litter the rooms.\n\nIn the very last scene, we see Art lying on a bed next to the lifeless bodies of his parents and brothers.\n\nAnd then his eyes open.\n\nThe government and its scientists were wrong after all. Appallingly, unbelievably, catastrophically wrong.\n\nBut there are no adults left to note the error because they all meekly submitted to the scientists. Only the child who was willing to question the consensus survives.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how the moral of the story could be any clearer. If this film isn\u2019t a searing indictment of the tyranny of government authoritarianism in the name of science, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nFew films can be described as genuinely prophetic, but this is one of them. Amazingly, it was scripted and mostly filmed before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, instead of fully embracing what she has created, writer/director Griffin has taken pains to distance her film from any applicability to the authoritarian policies growing out of the pandemic. She even expresses regret about using the term \u201cscientist\u201d in the film. When asked about what about what people should take away from her film, she responds that she hopes \u201cIt\u2019ll make us think, are we doing enough? Are we recycling enough? Are we paying enough taxes? Is our government making the right decisions? Are we getting vaccinated?\u201d\n\nPerhaps Griffin actually believes that this is her film\u2019s takeaway. Or perhaps she is embarrassed to acknowledge the film\u2019s anti-scientism message in the era of COVID-19. Or maybe she is just trying to keep from being blacklisted from doing her next film.\n\nIf she really wanted to undercut her film\u2019s critique of scientific authoritarianism, there was an easy way to do it. According to actress Keira Knightley, two endings were filmed. In one of them, Art doesn\u2019t wake up \u2014 which would have validated the arguments for infallible scientific authority.\n\nThankfully, Griffin didn\u2019t use that ending. As a consequence, her film is an absorbing, fascinating, and astute cautionary tale about both the human condition and the dangers of government and scientific hubris.\n\nSilent Night is a great film, and a terrific discussion starter. If you can tolerate the non-stop profanity, it\u2019s well worth adding to your watch list this Christmas season.\n\nThis article was originally published on December 17, 2021.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Silent-Night.jpeg", "image:width": "2400", "image:height": "1260", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A Christmas Nightmare for the COVID Era | Evolution News", "description": "The Christmas horror-comedy <i>Silent Night</i> offers a shrewd indictment of both mindless secularism and authoritarian science.", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2022/12/a-christmas-nightmare-for-the-covid-era-2/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2022-12-22T06:52+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2022-12-22T17:50+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-22T06:52+00:00"}, "tags": ["Christmas", "government", "pandemic", "Davida McKenzie", "Roman Griffin Davis", "movies", "House Beautiful", "Matthew Goode", "Great Britain", "secularism", "Republicans", "spoilers", "Keira Knightley", "Silent Night", "scientists", "Russia", "COVID-19", "C.
