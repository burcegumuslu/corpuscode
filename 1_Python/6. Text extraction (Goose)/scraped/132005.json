For example, implanted pacemakers and defibrillators might contain sensors that respond to magnets and radios when in close contact,\u201d the company stated. It further advised keeping Apple products more than six inches or 15 centimeters (cm) apart or more than one foot or 30 cm apart if wirelessly charging.\n\nThe tech giant also told users to always consult with their physician and their medical-device manufacturer for specific guidelines. \u201cIf you suspect that your Apple product is interfering with your medical device, stop using your Apple product,\u201d the Big Tech company recommended.\n\nThe company website listed products containing magnets that could potentially interfere with a medical device. They are:\n\nLast year, Popular Mechanics reported data from Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Radiation Protection, which cited figures for the European Union market. The 2020 Motorola Edge headed the list of radiation emission top offenders among mobile phones. Its radiation level of 1.79 watts per kilogram is flirting with the harmful range.\n\nThe Google Pixel 6, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 12 all have just about 1.00 watts per kilogram of radiation. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S21 Ultra has just 0.71 watts per kilogram of radiation and the Google Pixel 5A has .47 watts per kilogram.\n\nAccording to the write-up, a dose of two watts per kilogram may be considered the beginning of the harmful range of radiation. This radiation can affect users when talking on the phone while holding the device close to their heads. It can also affect them from inside their pockets or when holding phones in their hands.\n\nThe rise of mobile devices has contributed to more convenient communication for people in all corners of the world. However, there\u2019s been a lot of concern about the impact of radiation they emit on human health.\n\nAccording to various studies the electromagnetic waves these phones discharge could impact one\u2019s health negatively. Prolonged exposure to radiofrequencies (RF) has a negative impact on fertility and many researchers have associated RF with reduced sperm count, motility and concentration. Also, long exposure reduces brain cells, causing brain cell death in the memory and learning centers of the brain. (Related: New study links cell phone radiation to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.)\n\nMeanwhile, research papers have demonstrated that wireless signals can damage cognitive abilities such as learning, memory, attention and reaction. Also, excessive use of cell phones can result in high-frequency hearing loss and inner ear damage and may cause a significant risk of tumors on the auditory nerve in the brain.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have already classified RF-EMF is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).\n\nTo protect people from harmful mobile radiation, India\u2019s DowntoEarth website has listed some precautions to adopt. One is to keep the mobile phone away from the body as it is quite damaging to keep your cell phone in the pocket of your shirt or pants. The best option is to keep the phone in the bag.\n\nIt may sound \u201cold-school\u201d but when in the workplace or at the house, it is recommended to just use the landline phone. The site also recommended turning off the phone or placing it on airplane mode when not in use. It is also recommended to be done before going off to sleep.\n\nWhen it comes to exposing children to using mobile phones, one good tip is to download the videos already before handing over the phone to them. Putting it on airplane mode as they watch clips would also lessen the risk of radiation exposure in them.\n\nWhen taking a call, it was suggested to talk to the speaker. \u201cIt is better to use a hands-free speaker or earphones while talking on the cell phone. One can also keep the phone one-two cm away from the ear. Do not use Bluetooth,\u201d DowntoEarth further advised.\n\nLastly, texting as much as possible is way better than taking a call.\n\nFollow RadiationScience.com to learn more about radiation-emitting devices.\n\nWatch the video below that talks about protecting the body against hazardous EMF radiation.\n\nThis video is from the Abdulla channel on Brighteon.com.\n\n5G rollout must be stopped to avoid widespread exposure to EMF and RF radiation.\n\nApple\u2019s new iPhones to come with built-in 5G transmitters\u2026 AVOID all Apple products or be irradiated.\n\nInternal sources: Apple secretly firing contractors to cut costs despite job security assurances by CEO.\n\nStudies link cell phone radiation to health issues in children and unborn babies.", "opengraph": {"title": "Apple warns users with medical devices to keep iPhones away from body because they emit EMF", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-04-03-keep-iphones-away-because-they-emit-emf.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "Apple\u00a0has warned on its website support page that consumers using iPhones,\u00a0especially those with medical devices, should keep their mobile phones away from their bodies because mobile phones\u00a0emit electromagnetic fields (EMF).
