Lead signer and Cooper Stuff Podcast host John Cooper took to social media to explain the band\u2019s decision.\n\nThe outspoken rocker said performing at venues that mandate vaccines is something he is \u201cunwilling to do.\u201d The other members of Skillet, Cooper\u2019s wife and guitarist Korey, drummer Jen Ledger, and lead guitarist Seth Morrison share the same sentiment as their lead singer.\n\nSpeaking about the group\u2019s decision, Cooper said, \u201cI know this is going to make some people happy [and] it\u2019s going to make some people mad.\u201d The Sick of It singer shared that he does not want to make people mad, \u201cbut it is a matter of conviction for me.\u201d\n\nBreaking down what the band\u2019s convictions about mandates means, Cooper told fans that the band will only be playing concert venues that allow non-vaccinated attendees to bring a negative COVID-19 test result to gain entry to the show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you guys,\u201d Cooper said, \u201cI don\u2019t like this either. It is not ideal.\u201d The Awake & Alive to Truth: Finding Truth in the Chaos of a Relativistic World author laid out two options the band is currently faced with. Option one is to cancel the tour and option two is to play venues that allow fans to bring a negative test result for those who aren\u2019t vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI know this is going to make people disappointed on all sides of the fence for all sorts of different reasons. That\u2019s not my aim,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really difficult time.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "John Cooper and Skillet Won\u2019t Play Venues Mandating COVID-19 Vaccination", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you guys,\u201d Cooper said.", "image": "https://cdn.faithit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/skilletsings.png", "url": "https://faithit.com/john-cooper-skillet-wont-play-venues-mandating-vaccine/", "site_name": "Faithit", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/sharefaithit", "article:published_time": "2021-09-14T10:46:08-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-15T12:12:02-06:00", "updated_time": "2021-09-15T12:12:02-06:00", "image:width": "623", "image:height": "365"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://churchleaders.com/news/397929-skillets-john-cooper-blasts-woke-ideology-and-critical-race-theory-within-the-church.html", "https://www.skillet.com/tour", "https://churchleaders.com/news/392947-john-cooper-society-immorality.html", "https://churchleaders.com/news/392947-john-cooper-society-immorality.html", "https://www.facebook.com/skillet/posts/382548519898897", "https://churchleaders.com/news/403410-worship-churches-covid-proof-of-vaccination.html", "https://churchleaders.com/podcast/386528-john-cooper-fight-kingdom.html", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHzU-9iozmo", "https://faithit.com/become-a-contributor/", "https://churchleaders.com/podcast/386528-john-cooper-fight-kingdom.html", "https://faithit.com/john-cooper-skillet-wont-play-venues-mandating-vaccine/2/", "https://faithit.com/john-cooper-skillet-wont-play-venues-mandating-vaccine/2/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2021-09-14T10:46:08-06:00"}
