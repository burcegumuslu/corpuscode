These include older adults, immunocompromised individuals and children 2 years old and younger.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s proposal, experts say, would greatly simplify the Covid vaccination schedule in the United States \u2014 aligning it more closely with the annual flu shot.\n\nIn another similarity to the flu shot, the FDA is considering whether the Covid vaccine should be updated at least once a year, based on what strains are in circulation.\n\nThe agency\u2019s proposals will be put before its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on Thursday.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FDA proposes simplifying the Covid vaccine schedule, similar to the flu shot - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "Food and Drug Administration advisers will meet Thursday to discuss simplifying the Covid vaccination schedule, like flu shots", "url": "https://usahitman.com/fda-proposes-simplifying-the-covid-vaccine-schedule-similar-to-the-flu-shot/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-01-23T14:19:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-23T23:22:22+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/230123-pfizer-booster-al-0850-fa0ae5.webp", "image:width": "1240", "image:height": "827", "image:type": "image/webp"}, "tags": ["Flu Shot", "Covid Vaccine", "FDA", "Booster Shot", "Vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.fda.gov/media/164699/download", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html", "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccines-likely-annual-like-flu-shots-rcna46456", "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-proposes-simplifying-covid-vaccine-schedule-making-similar-flu-sho-rcna66961"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-01-23T14:19:00+00:00"}
