Her testimony focused on Supervisor Nathan Fletcher, who was in attendance that day.\n\n\u201cI was ridiculed by those who were supposed to be my colleagues and my friends,\u201d said Buettner, who formerly worked at the cardiovascular intensive care unit (ICU) at Rady Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cI am the face of your misinformation campaign, Nathan. I am the one who lost my career in pediatric cardiovascular ICU care. I took care of children who had COVID. I never got COVID at the hospital. I tested twice a week. I wore my PPE because I love my job, and I love this community.\u201d\n\nBuettner also mentioned that she took care of children affected with myocarditis after being injected with the COVID-19 vaccines. The said cases were not reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, she revealed. (Related: COVID vaccines found to increase risk of myocarditis in children by over 13,000 percent.)\n\n\u201cIt was an unspoken thing that we were not allowed to talk about openly on the unit.\u201d\n\nAccording to San Diego outlet KUSI News, Buettner had worked at Rady for 13 years. She was \u201cremoved from the bedside\u201d in October 2021 due to noncompliance with San Diego County\u2019s vaccine mandate for health workers. However, other hospitals in the county allowed unvaccinated nurses to remain employed with exceptions.\n\nEventually, Rady \u201cremoved the unvaccinated nurses because they were too great a risk\u201d \u2013 even though vaccinated employees were not being tested for COVID-19.\n\nBuettner was placed on unpaid, unprotected leave for six months, then officially terminated from her job on March 1. She explained that she didn\u2019t realize how much passion she had for being a nurse and saving children\u2019s lives until it was taken from her.\n\nA day after the hearing, Buettner sat down with KUSI News anchor Lauren Phinney to talk about her testimony. The former nurse, a resident of Fletcher\u2019s district, told the \u201cGood Morning San Diego\u201d host that she reached out to the supervisor\u2019s office many times \u2013 but received no replies.\n\n\u201cI sat through the Board of Supervisors meeting and was listening to the comments,\u201d she said during the Sept. 14 interview. \u201cI had a completely separate speech that I wanted to give. The topic was specifically on money allocation for testing and the continuance of the [county] emergency order.\u201d\n\nBuettner specifically pointed her finger at Fletcher for pushing the policies that led to the loss of her career, eventually deciding to tell him face-to-face during the public hearing. According to the former nurse, her testimony sought \u201cto hold Fletcher accountable for his poor leadership.\u201d The county supervisor degraded those who opposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates by accusing them of spreading misinformation.\n\n\u201cWhen I got up there, I was explaining who I was. And I realized: I\u2019m not a nurse anymore, I don\u2019t take care of these children anymore. That\u2019s the speech that I ended up giving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never disciplined, I\u2019ve never had any complaints. I was always someone who was considered a leader on my unit, and then I was removed from the bedside because of politics.\u201d\n\nThe former nurse also told Phinney that Rady later accepted religious exemptions for the COVID-19 booster dose, and allowed nurses with approved religious exemptions to continue working bedside.\n\n\u201cBecause of the rhetoric that has gone on, those within hospital leadership are able to make claims that we have found \u2026 are unsubstantiated in many respects.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know the vaccine does not prevent infection \u2026 [and] it doesn\u2019t prevent transmission. And so, we need to be able to have a conversation about that and allow people to continue to work within their jobs.\u201d\n\nBuettner found a silver lining in spite of her termination, telling the KUSI News anchor that since losing her job, she has been \u201ctrying to be an advocate\u201d for all the other healthcare professionals and hospital employees who were fired for noncompliance with COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nWatch nurse practitioner Tamika Morrow reveal the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccine below.\n\nThis video is from the Take Heed Lest Ye Fall channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nYoung nurse suffers from hemorrhage and brain swelling after second dose of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.", "opengraph": {"title": "California nurse fired for declining COVID shot testifies against San Diego County\u2019s vax mandate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2022-09-23-nurse-fired-refusing-vax-testifies-against-mandate.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "A health worker terminated for refusing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) shot gave a strong testimony\u00a0against the vaccine mandate currently in place in California\u2019s San Diego County.
