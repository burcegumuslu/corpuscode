Doctor Who Gave Kids COVID Vaccines Without Consent", "cleaned_text": "Children\u2019s Health Defense is funding a lawsuit by a D.C. mother alleging a doctor vaccinated two of her children for COVID-19 without her consent after falsely telling the teens the shots were required for school.\n\nThe mother of two children who were given COVID-19 vaccines without the mother\u2019s consent is suing the doctor who administered the vaccines.\n\nAn attorney representing NaTonya McNeil last week filed a lawsuit in Superior Court for the District of Columbia against Janine A. Rethy, M.D., M.P.H.\n\nAccording to the complaint, on Sept. 2, 2022, McNeil took her two older children, ages 15 and 17, to the KIDS Mobile Medical Clinic/Ronald McDonald Care Mobile clinic, operated by Georgetown Hospital, to complete their required annual physical exam for the 2022-2023 school year.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Rethy, director of the mobile clinic, held the children in the examination room longer than necessary for a regular check-up and vaccinated them against COVID-19 over their objections and without consulting their mother\n\nIn order to attempt to obtain the children\u2019s consent \u2014 which they are not legally able to provide without a parent or guardian \u2014 the doctor falsely informed the children the COVID-19 vaccine was mandatory for school attendance and told them they could not lawfully decline it if they wanted to attend school.\n\nThe suit, filed by D.C. Attorney Matthew Hardin, seeks damages for false imprisonment, battery and fraud.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) is financing the lawsuit because, according to CHD President and General Counsel Mary Holland, \u201cCHD couldn\u2019t just sit still and not allow this wrong to go unpunished and not bring this to the public\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with The Defender, McNeil explained why she is suing the the doctor:\n\n\u201cI just feel like people shouldn\u2019t be able to do whatever they want to do to other people and especially not to children. As a mother, I feel like, \u2018You all just took all my rights away from me to do what you wanted to do to my kids.\u2019\n\n\u201cI do want justice to be done in this case. I feel like something needs to be done. This can\u2019t just continue to happen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, Rethy\u2019s stated goal is to vaccinate all children against COVID-19. The complaint quotes her statement to the press:\n\n\u201cOur goal is to increase vaccination rates in children here in D.C. . . . For more than 30 years our role has been to be in the community to help address the problem of health disparities, bringing families care where they are.\n\n\u201cFor this particular effort, we are glad to be partnering with DC Health to provide both regular childhood vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines to all children.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her role as director of the mobile clinic, Rethy is chief of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital\u2019s Division of Community Pediatrics and assistant professor of pediatrics at Georgetown University School of Medicine.\n\nMcNeil said that when she took her older children to the clinic, she stayed outside the examination room to care for her infant. As soon as the children entered the doctor\u2019s office, she called her daughter\u2019s cellphone to let Rethy know she was just outside the door if the doctor needed to consult her for anything.\n\nAccording to McNeil, the doctor did not ask or inform her about any vaccinations, and did not ask her to sign anything. At the end of the physical, Rethy came out to talk to her.\n\nMcNeil said the doctor explained her son\u2019s asthma treatment plan, but that\u2019s all they discussed.\n\nAs they were heading home, McNeil said she was shocked when her daughter complained that her arm hurt \u201cpretty bad.\u201d When McNeil asked her why it hurt, her daughter said she was given the COVID-19 shot, even though she told the doctor she didn\u2019t want it.\n\nPlease Help the DailyClout / War Room Volunteers Blow the Biggest Story of Our Lifetime Wide Open\n\nThe information that Pfizer and the FDA wanted to keep hidden for 75 years has been thoroughly documented and compiled into an ebook \u2013 and made available on Amazon.\n\nWe are shattering expectations, but we need your continued support to push truth up the algorithm, which is not just good for the book and the project but also for the conversation, forcing the criminals to be confronted. We already have the blueprint for prosecution; we just need enough people aware of the crime that has occurred \u2014 demanding accountability:\n\nAlso available on our website.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Exclusive: Mother Sues D.C.
