Ask yourself where is funding for such studies?\"\n\nFor those who want to dive right in to the analysis, follow the below links:\n\nFor the cliffs notes version, Dowd has dropped the following Twitter thread summarizing their analysis:\n\nAnd for those who fell asleep in statistics class;\n\nAs one commenter notes, data from the UK reveals that firms are coming under increased pressure due to rising staff sickness, particularly among those over the age of 50.\n\nMore to come next week...\n\nDowd explained his views how he reacted to the pandemic to Tucker Carlson. Now he, and his partners, spend their time poring through data to shine a light on harsh realities.\n\nNote: Comments placed in [ ] are added by Truth11.com editor.
