Trump, those purveyors of fake news and ideologically tainted \u201creporting\u201d have been pushing a goofy narrative that Russian propaganda fed to hundreds of American news sites sabotaged Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\nWhy, you ask? Well, because Russian President Vladimir Putin loves Trump and, according to Clinton, has some grudge against her.\n\nSo, even though it was actually Clinton\u2019s campaign that was wholly scripted, based on lies and deception as well as a healthy dose of fake news from her adoring Left-wing media, it has been decided by the \u2018powers that be\u2019 alternative news sites and reporting must officially be deemed \u201cfake\u201d and, thus, censored. That\u2019s the only way to explain a post-election decision by social media giants Facebook and Google to begin relying on outside \u201cfact-checkers\u201d to weed out what they consider to be false news and information\u2014even if said reports are actually spot-on.\n\nBut there are already problems with this notion. Never mind that the fact-checking organizations including Snopes.com and Politifact are themselves highly partisan, the former is staffed in part by a woman who admittedly used to sell herself to the highest male bidder, destroying what little credibility the site still had.\n\nAs reported by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, actual \u201cprostitutes for the Presstitutes\u201d are working at Snopes.com \u201cfact-checking\u201d news for sites like Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe propagandizing \u2018fact-checking\u2019 website SNOPES is being run by a whore-digger who defrauded the publisher out of $98,000 to hire prostitutes, say now-public divorce documents,\u201d Adams noted, citing the original report in the UK\u2019s Daily Mail. \u201cOne of the site\u2019s administrators is an \u2018escort porn star,\u2019 and a fact-checker at SNOPES turns out to be a sex blogger named \u201cVice Vixen dome.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the reports noted further, the entire Snopes.com organization was founded upon an elaborate fraud scheme, with its CEO marrying an international escort worker who traveled the world to have sexual relations with VIP clients who then posted glowing online reviews of why she is such a wonderful choice to be hired as a \u201clover.\u201d\n\nAnd this is one of the sites that Facebook recently announced it would rely on to \u201cfact-check\u201d news reports to ensure the social media site operates with high standards of integrity and full transparency. But what\u2019s really happening is that Facebook\u2019s decision is nothing short of a thinly-veiled effort to censor independent journalism through the labeling of real news the site just doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfake\u201d news\u2014and with the help of prostitutes-turned-presstitutes.\n\nAs noted by Truthwiki, Snopes.com has regularly labeled legitimate, science-and-study-based reporting about vaccines, GMOs and false flag attacks as \u201cfake\u201d information, while regularly siding with Leftists and liberals, President Obama and the so-called \u201cestablishment\u201d on virtually every issue. And while it claims to be a bastion of truth and \u201cfactual\u201d referencing, it really functions like just another Left-wing propaganda outlet, declaring liberal garbage to be gospel no matter how demonstrably false and unproven it is. If you are a media outlet or independent scientist who disagrees with the accepted corporate/media/establishment \u201cnorm\u201d and \u201cfacts,\u201d you are stereotyped as unreliable and discredited, without a shred of evidence or proof to support the Snopes.com claims.\n\nSnopes\u2014and now Facebook\u2014are the sites without credibility\n\nIn this way, Adams noted, Snopes.com is operated much like Politifact, a site also operated by Left-wing \u201cpropagandists and mind manipulators.\u201d\n\nAs the Daily Mail notes further:\n\nIt was founded by husband-and-wife Barbara and David Mikkelson, who used a letterhead claiming they were a non-existent society to start their research. Now they are divorced \u2013 with Barbara claiming in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on \u2018himself and prostitutes\u2019.\n\nSnopes.com founder David Mikkelson\u2019s new wife Elyssa Young is employed by the website as an administrator\u2026 she has worked as an escort and porn actress and despite claims [that SNOPES] is non-political ran as a Libertarian for Congress on a \u2018Dump Bush\u2019 platform. Its main \u2018fact checker\u2019 is Kimberly LaCapria, whose blog \u2018ViceVixen\u2019 says she is in touch with her \u2018domme side\u2019 and has posted on Snopes.com while smoking pot.\n\nFacebook\u2019s entire plan to \u2018root out fake news\u2019 reeks of manipulation, propaganda and full-on censorship. And now, it has been completely exposed as being associated with a tawdry, unreliable and wholly discredited \u201cfact-checker\u201d web site as a partner.\n\nJ.D.
