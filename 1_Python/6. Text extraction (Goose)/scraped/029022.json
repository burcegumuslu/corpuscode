Ironically, Qin Shi Huang died from the toxic effects of consuming a so-called Elixir of Life made of mercury.\n\nThe story of Qin Shi Huang\u2019s search for immortality sounds like something straight out of a fairytale. For the last ten years of his life, China\u2019s first Emperor sent every scholar, magician, and wise man in the nation on a quest to find an elixir that would keep him from dying. He gave up everything in his mad war against the inevitability of death \u2013 and in the end, let his fear of dying drive him into an early grave.\n\nHis quest for immortality was not just driven by a desire for everlasting power, but his intense fear of death. Qin Shi Huang had elevated walkways and walled roads installed, connecting each building so that he\u2019d never have to walk outside exposed. Every window was covered with a curtain, and anyone who mentioned the emperor\u2019s location was put to death.\n\nA portrait painting of Qin Shi Huangdi, first emperor of the Qin Dynasty, from an 18th-century album of Chinese emperor's portraits.

On it was an inscription that read; \u201cThe First Emperor will die and his land will be divided.\u201d The Emperor was furious. He demanded to know who had written it, and when no one came forward, he had every person in the area executed. Then the meteor itself was pulverized into bits so that no one would ever see the message again.\n\nWhen the First Emperor overheard a rumor that the alchemists who had promised him the elixir of life were playing him for a fool, Qin Shi Huang flew into a rage. 460 scholars were dragged out of their homes and pulled to the capital. There he had a huge pit waiting for them. The Emperor had the wisest men in the kingdom thrown into the pit, and he buried them alive.\n\nThe Emperor tried all kinds of concoctions that were offered to him by his advisors. On his way home from his fifth tour of Eastern China, he stopped at a palace in Hopei and fell incredibly ill. He had been taking pills that one of his alchemists had promised would make him immortal. What they had given him were pills of poisonous mercury, a common ingredient in ancient Chinese elixirs , and he had just taken a lethal dose. He died that night.\n\nQin Shi Huang\u2019s search for endless life had resulted in his premature death. The nation erupted into civil war, and Qin Shi Huang\u2019s united China fell apart. The Emperor himself only lived to be 49.\n\nRead more: How the Search for Immortality Killed the First Emperor of China\n\nTop image: The First Emperor of China was Killed by an Elixir of Immortality.
