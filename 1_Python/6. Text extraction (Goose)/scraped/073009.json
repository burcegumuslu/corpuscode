He chided them for spreading deepfakes not occasionally but consistently.\n\nUsing the March 17 episode of \u201cWar Room\u201d on InfoWars as his platform, Shroyer lashed at MSNBC, Washington Post, New York Times and CNN for all the deepfakes they have pulled over America for a long time. (Related story: The fall of the mainstream media and the biggest lies they told in 2021.)\n\nAmong the examples of deepfakes cited by Shroyer were: vaccine safe and effective, (former President Donald) Trump-Russia collusion, the Hunter Biden laptop story, five cops died on the January 6 Capitol incident, Syria used chemical weapons, Ghost of Kyiv. The list is so long Shroyer said he could go on and on and on.\n\nBut what caught Shroyer\u2019s ire recently is when MSNBC \u201ctook an unknown video that nobody saw, and said: This is a deepfake. It\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d\n\nThat faked video purportedly shows Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky telling his troops to lay down their arms and yield to the Russian invaders. Although the Ukrainian authorities have warned such deepfakes are forthcoming as part of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war propaganda just two days before, MSNBC still willingly fell for the crap.\n\nMSNBC even had the gall to claim that the video went viral, according to Shroyer, when it was hardly seen by even those monitoring the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n\u201cAnd they (MSNBC) say, look how deepfakes are spreading on the internet,\u201d said Shroyer. \u201cAll MSNBC does is deepfakes. Your entire operation is a deepfake. You\u2019re not a news organization. You\u2019re a Democratic Party front group, you are a deepfake. MSNBC, warning me about deepfakes. That\u2019s hilarious. Your entire operation is a deepfake.\u201d\n\nThe truth is, Shroyer feels they (MSNBC or Democrats) may have made the clearly faked video themselves, perhaps to divert attention from two damning issues against President Joe Biden that have resurfaced and turned out to be true.\n\nThe first is Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop story. Dismissed as Russian disinformation by the corporate media before the 2020 elections, the New York Times has finally admitted the influence-peddling by the president\u2019s son was real. The Washington Post was obliged to follow suit and now the rest of the mainstream media is trying to catch up.\n\nThe second was the Ashley Biden diary that contained handwritten notes of the presidential daughter alleging her father was doing inappropriate things when they were in the shower together.\n\nLike Hunter\u2019s laptop, Ashley\u2019s diary is around as proof, unless somebody with magical powers manages to make it disappear.\n\nThe fact that the Biden administration has suddenly become \u201cso concerned about pornographic material being leaked\u201d roused suspicions of another cover-up in the making, Shroyer said.\n\nShroyer also cited the case of Natalia Sindeeva and Vera Krichevskaya, who were behind the controversial documentary Tango with Putin. After defying the Russian president, the Kremlin banned their TV station and deleted its media archive. The two women also told columnist Kevin Maher that they have faced arrest and imprisonment.\n\nThese things were familiar to Shroyer, a political activist. \u201cI\u2019ve been completely censored. I\u2019ve had my video archives arranged. I\u2019ve been faced with imprisonment,\u201d said Shroyer.\n\nBut just like the two Russian women, Shroyer won\u2019t be silenced. He\u2019s taking on the Biden administration, the Democrats and the mainstream media to prove that truth still prevails in the end.\n\nFollow MediaFactWatch.com for news related to the deepfakes propagated by mainstream media outlets.\n\nWatch the video below to know how MSNBC got caught deep faking the world.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBig Pharma, mainstream media looking to create the next big health scare as COVID fears subside.\n\nHow the mainstream media\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d undermines democracy and protects the corrupt establishment: new mini-documentary by the Health Ranger.\n\nMainstream media unleashes tsunami of fake news, yet none of them are removed from Google News for being fake.", "opengraph": {"title": "Owen Shroyer accuses mainstream media of spreading deepfakes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2022-03-25-shroyer-accuses-mainstream-media-of-spreading-deepfakes.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "Owen Shroyer couldn\u2019t hide his anger with the mainstream media any longer.
