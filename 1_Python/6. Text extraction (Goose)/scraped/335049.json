The racket involves operatives who develop personal relationships with senior citizens and convince the elderly to vote for a certain candidate through a mix of gifts and coercion. Once the senior citizen votes for the intended candidate, the operatives use different post offices to send absentee ballots by the elderly to avoid suspicion.\n\nProject Veritas tailed Raquel Rodriguez, one of the individuals who were part of the scheme. Rodriguez, who was nominally a political consultant for Republican House candidate Mauro Garza, bragged that she brought \u201cat least 7,000 votes\u201d to a certain candidate in this manner.\n\nIn one instance, Rodriguez was recorded on video convincing an elderly female voter to change her pick from Republican John Cornyn to Democrat M.J. Hegar. Both Cornyn and Hegar are running for election to the U.S. Senate. She told the woman: \u201cYou can vote for whoever you want, but \u2026 you said you were voting for Hegar [because] you were going straight Democrat. That\u2019s what you want to do, correct?\u201d\n\nAfterward, the political consultant examined the woman\u2019s absentee ballot and even guided her in \u201ccorrecting\u201d her pick. She helped the woman cross out the line for Cornyn and put her initials next to the line so that election officials know the correction \u201cwas done accidentally.\u201d Once the elderly woman finished changing her vote, Rodriguez presented her with a shawl as a gift.\n\nRodriguez told the Project Veritas journalist Garza gave her a $2,500 budget for his campaign, noting that she also offers voters rosaries, diabetic socks and wallets aside from the shawls.\n\nIn a later exchange with another Project Veritas journalist, she expressed worry about the instance witnessed by the earlier reporter. Acknowledging what she did was illegal, she said: \u201cI could go to jail. I\u2019m a little apprehensive to tell anybody what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nBallot chasing rackets and other fraudulent practices will become rampant if mail-in voting is pushed\n\nAccording to Jered Ede, Project Veritas chief legal officer, Rodriguez and her associates are liable for violating federal and state election laws.\n\nThe violations \u2013 including ballot harvesting and employing ballot harvesters, suggesting the candidates that voters should pick, coercing a voter to change their candidate and giving gifts to voters \u2013 are all punishable by imprisonment. Ede remarked that Rodriguez \u201dbragging about ensuring first-time voters and ex-inmates vote for her candidates\u201d definitely flouted the election laws in place.\n\nHowever, Raquel Rodriguez\u2019s ballot chasing scheme is not the first instance of electoral fraud targeting elderly voters in the Lone Star State. In 2018, four women were indicted on multiple vote fraud charges in Fort Worth amid the 2016 elections.\n\nThe office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the suspects conducted vote fraud by filling out applications for mail-in ballots with forged signatures. They would then either \u201cassist\u201d the voter with filling out the absentee ballot, or fill it out themselves and trick the voter into signing the ballot\u2019s return envelope.\n\nThe statement from Paxton\u2019s office also mentioned that the four were allegedly paid to target older voters on the north side of Fort Worth \u201cin a scheme to generate a large number of [mail-in] ballots and then harvest those ballots for specific candidates in 2016\u201d, the Star-Telegram reported. (Related: Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick warns the left will steal elections with vote-by-mail.)\n\nTexas has had an issue with ballot harvesting, even until now. A number of Democrats \u2013 including Dallas Jones \u2013 were recently accused of organizing a ballot harvesting scheme in Harris County, whose county seat is Houston. Jones was named as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s political director in the state in late August.\n\nRead more stories about various fraudulent schemes that undermine election integrity at VoteFraud.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Project Veritas infiltrates \u201cballot chasing\u201d ring targeting senior citizens in Texas", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2020-11-02-project-veritas-infiltrates-ballot-chasing-ring-texas.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "Undercover journalists at Project Veritas infiltrated a ballot chasing ring in Bexar County, Texas, mainly targeting senior citizens.
