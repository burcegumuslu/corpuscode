While there are many things that science can uncover, the one thing that humans will never be able to undermine is the plan of a higher power.\n\nBut, this iconic physicist died trying and what he found out is concerning, as it will happen during our children\u2019s lifetime.\n\nClick HERE to learn what Numerology says about your life using only your Birth Date.\n\nStephen Hawking, born in 1942 and died in 2018, was known to be one of the most significant theoretical physicists in all of history. Dubbed as the greatest scientist of all time since Albert Einstein, this legend spent his life studying the hidden mysteries of the universe.\n\nWith cosmology being the main focus of his work, Hawking\u2019s theories about the fate of humanity will remain forever relevant even though he is no longer physically with us. There seven predictions specifically that he made that would end life as we know it and become Earth\u2019s Demise.\n\nIn the age of pandemics and advancing technology, debates about vaccines have become a widespread conspiracy. It turns out that Stephen Hawking believed that the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s effect on human genes might be the demise of evolution.\n\nModern-day medicine is made through a mixture of human and cow DNA. This scientist believed that we are at risk of creating \u201csuper-humans,\u201d which he described as: \u201ca race of self-designing beings who are improving at an ever-increasing rate.\u201d Keep in mind that medicine has kept the human race evolving and has saved lives in the past, so this is a speculation.\n\nIn 2010, Stephen Hawking stated, \u201cIf aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\u2019t turn out well for the Native Americans.\u201d This legend was a firm believer of life on other planets, and he had no doubts that they would eventually visit us here on earth.\n\nHawking had a bone to pick with extraterrestrials, and he liked to think that if we were to come in contact with them, they would try to take over our planet and study us like a science experiment. But who are we to judge creatures we\u2019ve never even seen?\n\nThe End Of The Universe\n\nJust two weeks before his death, Hawking published his last work, \u201cA Smooth Exit From Eternal Inflation.\u201d In this study, the physicist revealed his prediction that the end of the universe is near. He believed that the bright and shiny stars that fill our night sky will eventually run out of energy, leaving us in total darkness forever.\n\nThe good thing is that the universe works in mysterious ways, so for all we know, it could have something much greater in store behind this plan. But, to be on the safe side, Hawking recommends: \u201cSpreading out into space will completely change the future of humanity. It may also determine whether we have any future at all.\u201d\n\nStephen Hawking believed that artificial intelligence was one of the worst things human beings have created. While this invention has benefitted society in many ways, the scientist predicts that it will eventually create monsters that will work against its creators to destroy us.\n\nThe physicist explained that AI has become so advanced that it\u2019s practically as smart as the human brain. He warned us that if we\u2019re not cautious about the technology we\u2019re producing, it will eventually redesign itself to take over human civilization into a world of robots, \u201cThis will be a new form of life that outperforms humans.\u201d\n\nViolence is never the answer, and Stephen Hawking was an advocate for the end of Nuclear Weapons. Not only did he believe they were bad for our environment, but he also knew that the animalistic side of human nature made the damages of warfare lethal to our civilization.\n\nHawking stated: \u201cAs scientists, we understand the dangers of nuclear weapons and their devastating effects, and we are learning how human activities and technologies are affecting climate systems in ways that may forever change life on Earth.\u201d\n\nWhen Hawking died in 2018, he had little hope left for humanity. He predicted that the damage that has been created on our planet has reached the point of no return. Between the overpopulation of Earth and the limited natural resources left to use, this scientist recommended that humans find another planet to live on within the next 100 years.\n\nThe bright side of this theory is that he did not leave us hopeless. Hawking\u2019s research shows that the moon and planet mars are both possible places in the galaxy that could rescue human civilization. If you\u2019re doubtful, you\u2019ll be glad to know that Elon Musk is working on a plan: \u201cIf things go super-well, it might be in the 10-year time frame.\u201d\n\nIt Might All Blow Up\u2026Literarily\n\nClimate change is an issue that we hear about daily yet continue to ignore. Hawking believes that at the rate of energy consumption humanity has been using, planet earth will combust into flames by the year 2600.\n\nIn a BBC documentary, the scientist explained: \u201cWith climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics, and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious.\u201d He predicts that global warming will turn the average temperature of the earth to 480 degrees Fahrenheit, the same weather conditions as Venus. Lucky for us, there\u2019s still plenty of time to change the course of history. So, love mother nature and do your part!\n\nLive Every Day Like It\u2019s Your Last\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Stephen Hawking did not leave this world optimistic about its future conditions. However, it\u2019s important to remember that these claims are simply only predictions made by a person just like you and I.\n\nWhile Hawking\u2019s brilliance is something to give him credit for, our fate is a secret that only a higher power has the answers to. So, take these theories as a simple reminder to live every day like it\u2019s your last, because yesterday is gone and tomorrow is never promised. And do your part in protecting our home where you can.\n\nAre you still searching for your life purpose?
