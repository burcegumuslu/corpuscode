But it has a modern unique weapon capable of destroying any adversary, including the United States, in the event of a threat to its existence.\u201d\n\nThe US is not really a democracy, nor does it seek to promote democracy in its relations with other nations, contrary to Washington\u2019s claims, senior Russian security official Nikolay Patrushev has said. He made the remarks while commenting on the upcoming \u2018Summit for Democracy\u2019 hosted by the US government. Patrushev, who is the secretary of the Russian Security Council, described the US economy as \u201cdependent on corruption and lobbying connections going to the White House and Capitol Hill.\u201d Corporate interests have hijacked the levers of political power in the US and use the country\u2019s international clout to pursue their own agenda, he said in an interview with Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper, to be published in full later today. Their democracy is a pretty facade for the political system, which serves to hide the neglect of the rights of ordinary Americans. Washington pursues the same approach in the international arena, where it claims to be the champion of democracy but disregards other nations\u2019 sovereignty, Patrushev said. He believes that this \u201chypocrisy\u201d will be on display at the Summit for Democracy, which will kick off this week in Washington. The event will be \u201ca gathering to support a world order in which Washington wants to play the central role forever. Dissenters will be labeled \u2018undemocratic states,\u2019\u201dhe predicted. The US, which \u201cappointed itself the dictator of the world, will harass the nations whose sovereignties and democracies were undermined,\u201dby Washington. The reality is that \u201cWashington has long been a leader in violating the sovereignty of other nations, in the number of wars and conflicts it has unleashed,\u201d the security chief said. He called the nations that support this arrangement \u201cvassals\u201d that are constantly \u201chumiliated\u201d in their abusive relationships with the US. The international event, which is being held for the second time, is meant to promote democracy against what Washington increasingly sees as assertive \u201cauthoritarian\u201d states. The US reportedly invited all participants of the first summit, which was held in 2021, including the administration of the self-governed Chinese island of Taiwan. NATO members Hungary and T\u00fcrkiye were snubbed once again, according to Foreign Policy magazine.\n\nPatrushev:\n\n \u201cThe collapse of the European Union is just around the corner\u2026The United States is ready to fight Russia\u2026to the last European. Even during the Cold War, the Pentagon, at the slightest danger from the USSR, was ready to turn Europe into a radioactive desert.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Russia] saved the US at least twice \u2013 during the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. But I believe that this time, helping the US to maintain its integrity would be inappropriate..\u201d\n\u2022 US Politicians \u2018Held Captive By Their Own Propaganda\u2019 \u2013 Patrushev (RT)\n\nUS politicians are \u201cheld captive by their own propaganda\u201d and still believe that Washington could deliver a fatal nuclear \u2018first strike\u2019 against Russia, the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, has said. That Cold War-era strategy, however, is nothing but a \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cshort-sighted\u201d delusion nowadays, Patrushev said in an interview with the newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta published on Monday. \u201cHeld captive by their own propaganda, American politicians for some reason remain confident that in the event of a direct conflict with Russia, the US is capable of delivering a preventive missile strike, after which Russia will no longer be able to respond. This is a short-sighted delusion, and a very dangerous one,\u201d Patrushev stated. The \u2018first strike\u2019 strategy dates back to the early days of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the US. Its proponents believe that achieving a certain advantage in nuclear warheads and means of delivery would allow a preemptive strike on an adversary without suffering an equally destructive retaliation. The concept was among the primary reasons behind the Cold War-era arms race, with both sides fearing a first strike at various points. Nowadays, however, Russia possesses state-of-the-art weapons that Patrushev warned are capable of defeating any opponent, should the country\u2019s existence be threatened. \u201cForgetting the lessons of history, some in the West are already talking about revanche, which will lead to a military victory over Russia,\u201d he stated. \u201cRussia is patient and does not threaten anyone with its military advantage. But it has modern unique weapons capable of destroying any enemy, including the US, in case of a threat to its existence.\u201d Moreover, Moscow no longer believes it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d to help the US once again defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity should it be threatened, the security official stated. \u201c[Russia] saved the US at least twice \u2013 during the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. But I believe that this time, helping the US to maintain its integrity would be inappropriate,\u201d Patrushev said.\n\nAs \u201c..NATO members appeared to be using the Ukraine crisis to dispose of \u201cold equipment they no longer need.\u201d, Russia issues new jets.\n\nIt\u2019s what happens when you only blindly follow.\n\u2022 The EU Is Losing Relevance In The Emerging New World (Fomenko)\n\nVladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met in Moscow last week, and Western circles predictably responded by accusing Russia of becoming \u201csubservient\u201d or even a \u201cvassal state\u201d to China. MEP Guy Verhofstadt, a Euro-fantasist and former prime minister of Belgium, jeered on Twitter, \u201cPutin\u2019s appalling legacy now includes turning Russia more and more into a Chinese vassal state,\u201d oblivious to the irony of his own words. As the United States took the lead in denouncing China\u2019s peace plan for the Ukraine conflict, publicly setting out the conditions on which it should end, the European Union was nowhere to be seen, or at least had nothing original to say. This makes Verhofstadt\u2019s comments a damning display of lacking self-awareness. Russia and China are setting out their vision for a new multipolar world, while the US struggles against them in seeking to maintain its hegemonic position. Meanwhile, the European Union has been reduced to the status of a mere bench player in it all, and has become effectively irrelevant. The failure of EU countries to stake out their own will and position amidst the larger powers, as well as their total subservience to the US, has made a mockery of the \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d concept once championed by Emmanuel Macron. \u201cStrategic autonomy\u201d is a principle of European integration where the EU should be an actor in a multipolar world, which advocates for its own interests and pursues its own agenda. Supporters of this principle insist that the EU should not blindly follow the will of the US when it comes to every foreign policy issue, but should be proactive and enhance its role on the world stage. Therefore, they should not, as is commonly demanded by Washington, take sides on matters such as a new Cold War with China. The term gained growing traction during the years of the Trump administration, when Europe\u2019s relations with the US hit a low due to his particular interpretation of the \u201cAmerica first\u201d doctrine. However, the practical reality of \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d is that the EU is not a unitary state, but a loose intergovernmental organization of states which, while seeking to establish common positions on a principle of unity, do not truly have a unified foreign-policy-making mechanism. The intra-institutional politics of the EU are often a messy compromise and battle of wills between different levels of actors, including the states themselves, the European Commission, and the European Parliament. This combines with the reality that \u201cEuropean integration\u201d has been a broken process since 2008. Challenges such as the Eurozone financial crisis, Brexit, Covid-19, and internal conflicts with various states such as Poland have all weakened and fractured the EU. As a result, the EU has been ill-suited to deal with what is, despite media misdirection, the single most explicit source of foreign influence and interference against it, the US. Washington has multiple channels whereby it exerts control over the EU\u2019s many foreign policy actors. Firstly, it uses a web of government-funded think tanks and associated journalists to control public opinion and steer EU countries towards supporting its objectives. Secondly, the US has an extraordinarily political hold over the former Soviet bloc states to the east of the EU (with the exception of Hungary), which it uses to foment increased antagonism against Russia and China, and therefore undermines the attempts of the bloc\u2019s most \u201cautonomous\u201d and powerful states \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 to pursue more reconciliatory foreign policies.\n\nWow: \u201c..Ukrainian border guard service discouraged draft-dodgers from seeking asylum in the EU, noting in an interview on Monday that if the man had succeeded in his border crossing, \u201che would have been returned to Ukraine.\u201d\n\u2022 Conscription May Be Intensified In Ukraine (RT)\n\nUkraine may need to conscript even more people into military service to potentially fight against Belarus, a key ally of President Vladimir Zelensky has told British television. David Arakhamia, an MP who heads the faction of the president\u2019s Servant of the People party in the Ukrainian parliament, spoke of a potential a clash with Belarus during an interview with SkyNews on Monday. He was commenting on Russia\u2019s announcement last week that it would place tactical nuclear weapons at a facility currently being built on Belarusian soil. \u201cI think we are facing a real challenge to have a second front opened,\u201d the Ukrainian lawmaker said. \u201cThat would mean a real challenge to get even more people to conscript into the army, because we will need at least eight more brigades to control the frontline.\u201d However, Arakhamia downplayed his own concerns by saying that much of the border his country shares with Belarus is rough terrain dominated by swamps and forests, which makes it easier to defend. He also acknowledged that despite Kiev perceiving Belarus as \u201cthe same aggressor as Russia,\u201d there actually was \u201cno evidence during one year of war \u2026 of any Belarussian soldier crossing the Ukrainian border.\u201d Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has allowed the Russian military to use his nation\u2019s territory in its military operation against Ukraine, but repeatedly stressed that Belarusian troops were not participating in it. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the decision to place nuclear weapons in Belarus was a step prompted by the UK\u2019s announcement that it would send depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine. Ukraine is believed to have suffered significant casualties in the conflict with Russia, in part because Kiev has reportedly been sending untrained soldiers to the frontline as it keeps its more experienced troops behind for an expected counter-offensive. Ukrainian military officials have already ramped up their mobilization efforts, according to various media sources. Reports have surfaced of conscription officers conducting raids at places where military-age men congregate, such as markets and even night clubs. Some Ukrainians appear willing to risk their lives to avoid joining the military. Last week, a 23-year-old man drowned while trying to sneak into Romania across the Tisza River. This was reportedly the 14th such fatality this year alone. A spokesman for the Ukrainian border guard service discouraged draft-dodgers from seeking asylum in the EU, noting in an interview on Monday that if the man had succeeded in his border crossing, \u201che would have been returned to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe UN Security Council did not accept Russia/China resolution on the establishment of a commission to investigate the sabotage at Nord Stream. The resolution was supported by 3 countries (Russia, China and Brazil), no one voted against, 12 abstained.\n\nChina and Russia will be fine.\n\nAfter wolfing down a heartburn-inducing Popeye\u2019s Shrimp Tacklebox Combo for supper, Manhattan District attorney Alvin Bragg retires to his four-poster Sleep Number bed beset with anxiety about the grand jury he has convened for fulfilling his campaign promise to stuff Donald Trump into a state prison cell. From the wall-mounted flat-screen across from his bed, the specter of a of giant rabbit emerges, gaunt and grizzled, draped in chains and weighty padlocks. \u201cWho are you, spirit?\u201d Bragg asks.\u201cI am the ghost of prosecutions past,\u201d it moans. \u201cThis night you will be visited by three other spirits: The ghost of what you wish to be, the ghost of what should be, and the ghost of actually what-it-is.\u201d Oh, Gawd,\u201d Bragg groans, his esophagus on fire with acidified hot-sauce residue. The DA falls back into a febrile sleep, but wakens minutes later. The bedroom of his condo has transformed itself into a sunny street scene. He is riding an open limousine down Broadway through a blizzard of tickertape, the sidewalks filled with cheering citizens. Beside him sits a nubile person of the birthing persuasion, with supernaturally large infant-feeding glands, not unlike a certain star of adult films at the center of his brilliant case against the former president. \u201cI am the ghost of what you wish to be,\u201d she says, her breath warm in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re a bigger star now than ever I was in life, and without all the mess.\u201d \u201cYeah? What\u2019s that up ahead?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe steps of City Hall where you will receive your Nobel Peace Prize and be handed the nomination for governor, your stepping stone to the White House.\u201d \u201cWe gonna have to change the name of that place,\u201d Bragg grumbles. Suddenly a box appears on Bragg\u2019s lap. It contains two McDonald\u2019s Sausage, Egg, and Cheese McGriddles\u00ae plus an apple fritter and a caramel macchiato. No sooner do his teeth close on that first delicious bite, when the confetti in the air turns to pixels, which dissolve along with the street scene, and then Bragg is back in his bed. Laughter rings across the big room, but with a demonic dissonance. A large white man with a silvery mane of hair and a nose like an Appalachian dulcimer, draped in black judicial robes, sits up behind a lofty bench, wearing a scowl of privilege. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Bragg asks. \u201cYour law license, asshole.\u201d\n\nSome stories are crazier than others.\n\u2022 The Worst Model in History: How the Curve was not Flattened (Ugo Bardi)\n\nSo, do we run the risk of making the same mistakes with climate change mitigation that were made with the attempt to flatten the curve during the Covid-19 epidemic? That is, do we risk disrupting the fabric of society for an overestimated risk or for the misattribution of the causes of the problem? I\u2019d say it is unlikely, but we need to keep an open attitude and accept that, with new data, models must change (which is exactly what was not done with the Covid epidemic). The only certain thing is that disasters are unavoidable if complex systems are left to politicians to manage. There are several other areas of modeling that developed features that could be described as \u201cflattening the curve\u201d \u2014 perhaps the main one is the series of scenarios presented in the 1972 study, \u201cThe Limits to Growth.\u201d One of the proposals, for instance, was to place a cap on industrial production to reduce the exploitation of natural resources. \n\n It is likely that it was never intended as a realistic proposal but rather as an illustration of the features of the model. In any case, there were no global political structures that could have imposed such a rule, and its consequences on the real world would have been unknown and possibly negative or even disastrous. Indeed, if you look at the most recent incarnation of the concepts at the basis of \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d idea, the 2022 study \u201cEarth4All,\u201d you\u2019ll see that there are no proposals aiming at \u201cflattening\u201d any curve. The proposed interventions are all based on resource allocation, changes in the financial and political structure of society, and more aiming at steering, but not forcing, the system to move in a certain direction. It is an approach pioneered, among others, by one of the authors of the 1972 \u201cThe Limits to Growth,\u201d Donella Meadows, with her concept of \u201cleverage points.\u201d We are still learning how to manage complex systems, but we are starting to understand that brutal, top-down actions do not usually work.\n\n\u201c..if a sponsor doesn\u2019t like what the committee has to say\u2014the conclusions of the committee\u2014\u2026 the sponsor can\u2019t prevent the report from being made public,\u201d Stratton said. \u201cThis is a very powerful tool that we have.\u201d\n\u2022 US Expert Panel to Meet on Adverse Events Caused By COVID-19 Vaccines (ET)\n\n\u201cAustralia is experiencing worse excess mortality than at any point in 80 years, while neighboring New Zealand is experiencing the worst mortality since the Spanish flu.\u201d\n\n\u201cNet Zero is becoming the dividing line in the age-old battle between Right and Left, Free markets and Socialism, Cavaliers and Roundheads..\u201d\n\u2022 Climate Hysteria and Woke Gobbledegook Are Becoming Inseparable (DS)\n\nOne of Britain\u2019s leading climate \u2018experts\u2019, Professor Kevin Anderson, has provided a valuable insight into the increasingly bizarre demands that surround the promotion of the collectivist Net Zero political project. Writing in the Conversation, he argues for Net Zero within 12 years, complete with a refit of U.K. housing stock, a withdrawal of all combustion engine cars in favour of expanded public transport, electrification of industry, the roll out of \u2018zero-carbon\u2019 energy, and the banning of all fossil fuel production. To achieve his aims, Anderson suggests mobilisation on the scale of the post-war European reconstruction Marshall Plan. Others might suggest his crackpot schemes will leave the country facing a similar scale of destruction, ruin and poverty to that caused by the Luftwaffe. Anderson is currently a Professor of Energy and Climate Change at the University of Manchester and he has plenty of form when it comes to extremist claims and calls for widespread rationing. As early as 2010, he was calling on politicians to consider a rationing system \u201csimilar to the one introduced during the last time of crisis in the 1930s and 40s\u201d. He also suggested a limit on electricity \u201cso people are forced to turn the heating down\u201d, and a limit on goods that require a lot of energy to manufacture. On a practical level, Anderson\u2019s latest calls for radical societal restructuring under the guise of a \u2018climate emergency\u2019 are plainly ridiculous. Retrofitting Britain\u2019s well-ventilated housing and industrial stock along with installing heat pumps would cost around \u00a33 trillion, according to a paper published last year by the technology professor Michael Kelly \u2013 equivalent, it should be noted, to Britain\u2019s annual GDP. That, of course, is before we\u2019ve factored in the cost of Anderson\u2019s other plans such as retrofitting the entire industrial and transport infrastructure, all within the next 12 years. In its more sane moments, even Extinction Rebellion might be proud of such an ambitious plan. Collectivist economic solutions alongside the ubiquitous woke dogma are increasingly dominating debate around climate change. This blatantly political agenda is said to be dictated by \u2018the Science\u2019 which its advocates then refuse to discuss, a ruse used to disguise the paucity of evidence that humans control the climate thermostat. Net Zero is becoming the dividing line in the age-old battle between Right and Left, Free markets and Socialism, Cavaliers and Roundheads. In the U.S. the issue is rapidly becoming yet another fight between the Republicans and the Democrats. Similar trends are likely in the U.K. and Europe as Net Zero starts wreaking economic and social havoc.\n\nThe Mandelbulb is a 3-dimensional fractal that can be constructed as a Mandelbrot set in 4 dimensions using quaternions and bicomplex numbers.
