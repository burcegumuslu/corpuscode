I drew yellow circles around previous periods during the pandemic where mortality exceeded the current death levels. You can see that the current level of mortality has very few past recent periods that exceeded it \u2013 so the UK has, sadly, much to worry about.\n\nGermany\u2018s mortality data is provided as a nice spreadsheet with daily registered deaths, which you can download here. The sheet titled \u201cD_2016_2023_Tage\u201d provides daily deaths for 2016-2023. I calculated the 7-day running average of deaths for each day of 2023 and compared it with the 7-day running average for the same days in 2016-2019. Here\u2019s the chart of daily German excess mortality:\n\nYou can see that a brief two-week period of negative excess mortality has ended, and Germany\u2019s excess mortality is again very positive at about 12%, and growing.\n\nWhat causes those excess deaths?\n\nWe seem to have a strange dialogue. Vaccine skeptics say, \u201cIt is the COVID vaccine.\u201d Such an assertion is supported by country-level data, where excess mortality around the end of 2022 correlated positively with COVID vaccination rates. However, we are not yet sure what is the exact biological mechanism, and correlation is not proof of causation.\n\nThis is one of my analyses that made some waves, showing such a correlation:\n\nI also wrote a Germany-specific post, showing that Covid boosters have similar health effects among German Bundeslands as they do among developed countries. Please check it out.\n\nBelow is the overview of my other excess mortality articles:\n\nVaccine advocates say, \u201cIt is definitely not the vaccine,\u201d without offering viable alternatives. The health authorities refuse to investigate the situation as if they do not want the answers to be known. Without extensive autopsies, pathology research, and individual-level statistical exploration, we cannot know the exact mechanism that caused 21% more than normal deaths among Brits in the week ending on Mar 31, 2023, and that caused 11% more than normal deaths among Germans around the same time.\n\nPeople are dying. We are groping in the dark. The health authorities and the press, complicit in the Covid vaccination campaign, insist that we must \u201cmove on from the pandemic\u201d and forget the continuing unabated excess deaths.\n\nAs the people who died are buried or cremated, the hope of learning what killed them is fading. This is exactly what health authorities who force-injected us with unproven genetic treatments want \u2014 in hopes of avoiding prosecution.\n\nAnd if we do not know what is killing people, we cannot save them.\n\nWill they be able to cover up the cause of excess deaths?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "Excess Deaths Back With a Vengeance in the UK and Germany | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "Authorities refuse to investigate excess death rates in different countries; these have just spiked once again in the UK and Germany.", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/excess-deaths-back-with-a-vengeance-in-the-uk-and-germany/", "article:published_time": "2023-04-17T08:40:29+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-17T08:40:29+00:00"}, "tags": ["excess deaths", "Pam Barker", "excess mortality Germany", "COVID Vaccine Deaths", "Igor Chudov", "excess mortality UK", "Europe Reloaded"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending31march2023", "https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.xlsx?__blob=publicationFile", "https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/covid-boosters-are-killing-germans", "https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/excess-deaths-back-with-a-vengeance?publication_id=441185&post_id=115268015&isFreemail=true"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-04-17T08:40:29+00:00"}
