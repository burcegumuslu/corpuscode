In a 2013 estimate, about 20 million negative effects from treatment had occurred globally.[8]\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) for 2019, millions of patients are injured and 2.6 million people die each year as a result of non-compliance with safety regulations in health care[9].\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) for 2019, millions of patients are injured and 2.6 million people die each year in low- and middle-income countries as a result of non-compliance with safety regulations in health care. Around the world, the personal, social and economic harm caused by harm to patients amounts to many trillions of US dollars. According to the WHO Director General Dr. TA Gebreyesus, every minute in the world at least one person dies from harm in the provision of medical care[10].\n\nThe most serious consequences are caused by errors in diagnosis, in the prescription of medicines and their use. Medicinal errors alone cause an estimated US $42 billion annually in damage. Every year, non-observance of safety and hygiene rules during surgery causes complications in almost 25% of patients and leads to the death of one million patients during surgery or immediately after it[11].\n\nIatrogenesis may cause as many as 225,000 deaths per year in the United States (excluding recognizable error). An earlier Institute of Medicine report estimated 230,000 to 284,000 iatrogenic deaths annually. [12] The US numbers include:\n\u2022 20,000 due to other errors in hospitals\n\nA study 2016 from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine calculated 251,000 deaths per year, equating to nearly 700 deaths a day, about 9.5 percent of all deaths annually in the United States.[13]\n\nDr. Martin Makary, the leader of the study, said \u201cMoreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn\u2019t require reporting of errors in the data it collects about deaths through billing codes, making it hard to see what\u2019s going on at the national level.\u201d\n\nFrederick van Pelt, a doctor who works for The Chartis Group, a health care consultancy, said another element of harm that is often overlooked is the number of severe patient injuries resulting from medical error. \"Some estimates would put this number at 40 times the death rate,\" van Pelt said,[14] which means 10 million severe injuries as a result of medical errors.\n\nIn Germany, only one third of all errors that occur in the regulation of medicines are the responsibility of the nursing staff, where confusion, for example, played a role here. In the other two thirds of cases, it is the doctors who are responsible, for example due to non-observance of contraindications or negative interactions. According to calculations, 57,000 people die at Internal Medicine stations every year due to medical drugs. Of these, 28,000 deaths are avoidable[15].\n\nMany of the responses to Covid-19 were iatrogenic.\n\nRegardless of what one thinks of the actual existence, origins or severity of Covid-19, it is clear the early treatments methods caused severe damage. The treatment protocols, like in Italy in March 2020, demanded hospitals use a mix of strong antibiotics and mechanical ventilators. Even in routine circumstances, people put on respirators have a high risk severe complications or dying[17]. The heavy-duty antibiotics, in themselves severely weakening patients, were even more counterproductive in a hospital environment where antibiotic-resistant bacteria were common[18].\n\u2022 The closing of hospitals led to delayed or cancelled medical treatment for other problems like cancer, heart disease,surgical procedures and many others [19].\n\u2022 The enforced isolation of elderly people, stated as a measure protect them, led to widespread depression and loss of will to live[20].\n\u2022 The general societal climate of fear has caused widespread psychological sufferings like depression,suicidal thoughts[21], obsessive-compulsive behavior like excessive hand-washing[22] or other hygiene measures, self-isolation or needless fear of death.\n\u2022 The enforced mask-wearing will increase the risk of number[23] of illnesses, from bacterial infections[24], rotten teeth ('mask mouth'), carbon dioxide poisoning[25][26][27], to increased long term health risks[ ].\n\u2022 The insufficiently tested vaccines being pushed on people 2021 out are likely to cause an unknown amount of health damage.\n\nA 1977 study published in The Lancet stated that the risks of the whole-cell pertussis jab (used in the DTP vaccine) exceeded the risks associated with wild pertussis.[28]\n\nIn 1983 an NIH-funded UCLA study found that Wyeth's DTP vaccine was killing or causing severe brain injury, including seizures and death, in 1 in every 300 vaccinated children.[29] The resultant lawsuits caused the collapse of insurance markets for vaccines and threatened to bankrupt the industry. Wyeth\u2014now Pfizer\u2014claimed to be losing $20 in downstream liability for every dollar it earned on vaccine sales, and induced Congress to pass the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in 1986 shielding vaccine makers from liability.[30]\n\nThe 20th-century social critic Ivan Illich broadened the concept of medical iatrogenesis in his 1974 book Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health[31] by defining it at three levels.\n\u2022 First, clinical iatrogenesis is the injury done to patients by ineffective, unsafe, and erroneous treatments as described above. In this regard, he described the need for evidence-based medicine 20 years before the term was coined.[32]\n\u2022 Second, at another level social iatrogenesis is the medicalization of life in which medical professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical device companies have a vested interest in sponsoring sickness by creating unrealistic health demands that require more treatments or treating non-diseases that are part of the normal human experience, such as age-related declines. In this way, aspects of medical practice and medical industries can produce social harm in which society members ultimately become less healthy or excessively dependent on institutional care. He argued that medical education of physicians contributes to medicalization of society because they are trained predominantly for diagnosing and treating illness, therefore they focus on disease rather than on health. Iatrogenic poverty (above) can be considered a specific manifestation of social iatrogenesis.\n\u2022 Third, cultural iatrogenesis refers to the destruction of traditional ways of dealing with, and making sense of, death, suffering, and sickness. In this way the medicalization of life leads to cultural harm as society members lose their autonomous coping skills. It is worth noting that in these critiques \"Illich does not reject all benefits of modern society but rejects those that involve unwarranted dependency and exploitation.\"[33]", "opengraph":
