The father, on the other hand, could see something was terribly wrong after the second injection.\n\nThe skin surrounding his daughter\u2019s eyes swelled. His daughter had been complaining for weeks about pains in her legs, where bruises had appeared out of nowhere. The 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in January, only weeks after the second treatment.\n\nLi (an alias) told reporters, \u201cMy baby was totally healthy before the vaccine dosage.\u201d \u201cI took her to the doctor for a checkup.\u201d \u201cEverything appeared to be normal.\u201d\n\nTheepochtimes.com reports: He is among hundreds of Chinese that belong to a social media group claiming to be suffering from or have a household member suffering from leukemia, developed after taking Chinese vaccines. Eight of them confirmed the situation when reached by The Epoch Times. Names of the interviewees have been withheld to protect their safety.\n\nThe leukemia cases span across different age groups from all parts of China. But Li and others particularly pointed to a rise in patients from the younger age group in the last few months, coinciding with the regime\u2019s push to inoculate children between 3 and 11 years old beginning last October.\n\nLi\u2019s daughter had her first injection in mid-November under the request of her kindergarten. She is now undergoing chemotherapy at the Lanzhou No. 2 People\u2019s Hospital where at least 20 children are being treated for similar symptoms, most of them between the age of 3 and 8, according to Li.\n\n\u201cOur doctor from the hospital told us that since November, the children coming to their hematology division to treat leukemia have doubled the previous years\u2019 number and they are having a shortage of beds,\u201d he said.\n\nLi claimed that at least eight children from Suzhou district, where he lives, have died recently from leukemia.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s hematology division could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nRoughly 84.4 million children between the 3-11 age group have been vaccinated as of Nov. 13, according to latest figures from China\u2019s National Health Commission, accounting for more than half of the population in that age bracket.\n\nThere had been some resistance from Chinese parents when the campaign to vaccinate children first rolled out. They expressed concern about the lack of data about the effects of Chinese vaccines on young people. The vaccines are supplied by two Chinese drugmakers, Sinopharm and Sinovac, which carry an efficacy rate of 79 percent and 50.4 percent, respectively, based on available data from trials conducted on adults.\n\nThere\u2019s limited information about the health effects of these vaccines on children, and the World Health Organization said in late November that it has not approved the two vaccines for emergency use on the underaged.\n\nBut parents who were reluctant to vaccinate their children have faced pressure to comply. Some said they lost work bonuses or were given a talk by their supervisors. In other cases, their children faced punishment varying from losing honors or even getting barred from attending school, as in the case of Wang Long\u2019s 10-year-old son.\n\n\u201cThe school told us last year to take him for vaccination on such and such date, or he can\u2019t go to class,\u201d Wang, from eastern China\u2019s Shandong Province, told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe boy received his second dose on Dec. 4. A month later, he began experiencing fatigue and low fever. He is now at Shandong University Qilu Hospital, being treated for acute leukemia, diagnosed on Jan. 18.\n\nOn WeChat, the all-in-one Chinese social media platform, Li has come to know over 500 patients or their family members sharing the same predicament.\n\nThe local disease control center, when called by Li and others, had promised an investigation. But these probes invariably ended with the officials declaring the leukemia cases as \u201ccoincidental\u201d and thus unrelated to the vaccines.\n\nThe authorities said the same in 2013, following the deaths of over a dozen toddlers after Hepatitis B jabs.\n\nBut Li and others in a similar situation are far from being convinced.\n\n\u201cI dare say they didn\u2019t do any verification but only went through the motions,\u201d said Li.\n\nLi suspects that authorities are giving him the runaround. The officials told him a panel of experts would start an investigation within his province, but when he called the provincial level health agency, they disavowed any knowledge, saying reports of these cases had never reached them.\n\nLi and others seeking scrutiny of this issue also stand little chance to get their voices heard in the vast Chinese censorship machinery that constantly filters out anything deemed harmful to the communist regime\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cThe information gets blocked the instant we try to post something online. You can\u2019t send it out,\u201d said Li.\n\nWhen China\u2019s two top political bodies met last week for its most important annual gathering in what Beijing called the \u201cTwo Sessions,\u201d Li pitched in the WeChat group the idea of petitioning in the capital to get the authorities\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cThe police called us one by one,\u201d said Li. \u201cThey said we have made things up and ordered us to withdraw from the chat group.\u201d\n\nThe group was soon disbanded. An information sheet containing details of over 200 leukemia patients, filled out by members of the group, is no longer accessible.\n\nAccording to Li, there are signs indicating that authorities are well aware of this issue. Doctors, when receiving patients presenting with similar symptoms, would first ask them if they had taken the vaccine, he said, citing information he learned from the WeChat group.\n\n\u201cGot it, they would say, and that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d he said of the doctors\u2019 questioning.\n\nLi got the same reaction when calling the hotline for Chinese state broadcaster CCTV in the hopes of getting media exposure.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we said the children had taken COVID-19 vaccine, they asked me if she had gotten leukemia. They knew,\u201d said Li. \u201cThey said that they got too many calls because of this.\u201d\n\nThe cost for treatment is estimated at around 400,000 to 500,000 yuan ($63,093 to $78,867), more than 20 times the average annual income.\n\nWang, whose 10-year-old was diagnosed with leukemia, is the sole breadwinner for his family and is already under strain making mortgage repayments. He received about only 1,000 yuan ($157) through the state social assistance program to help pay for his son\u2019s treatment.\n\n\u201cI stayed at the hospital until 4 a.m. the night before,\u201d said Wang, adding that the crushing news has quite \u201cbroken\u201d the boy\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cHad he inherited it from the family, we\u2019d accept it as our lot,\u201d Wang said. \u201cBut he got sick because of the vaccine. I just can\u2019t reconcile it.\u201d\n\nLi, meanwhile, has been borrowing money from his relatives for the hospital fees. Some of the money trickles in in bills of 20 and 30 yuan, the equivalent of a few dollars, he said.\n\nLi has heard no response from officials or the media.\n\nHis friend who works at the local health commission overseeing the distribution of vaccines has told him to not put much hope in the matter.\n\n\u201cThe officials knew that you could get leukemia, but the \u2018arm is no match for the thigh,\u2019\u201d the friend told him, referring to a Chinese metaphor. \u201cThis is a national issue.\u201d\n\nThe Health Commission of Lanzhou City, the Health Commission of Gansu Province, the Gansu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Lanzhou Disease Prevention and Control Center, the Jiuquan City Disease Prevention and Control Center, Sinopharm, and Sinovac did not answer multiple calls for comment.\n\nThe National Health Commission, Sinopharm, and Sinovac did not immediately respond to email queries from The Epoch Times.\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
