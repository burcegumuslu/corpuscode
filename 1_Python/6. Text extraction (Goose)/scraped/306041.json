The proposal comes as the Biden administration considers keeping a list of workers who apply for religious exemptions to the vaccine mandate for federal employees.\n\nThe Commerce Department has about 47,000 employees and an $11.4 billion annual budget.\n\nThe new rule would undermine the personal freedom of federal employees, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a critic of federal COVID-19 policies, said.\n\n\u201cAs I have said repeatedly, these pointless vaccine mandates are a direct violation of the personal freedom of Americans,\u201d Johnson told The Daily Signal in a written statement. \u201cTreating COVID-19 medical exemptions as \u2018disability accommodations\u2019 shows how little the Biden administration and the COVID gods value liberty and informed consent.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, the Biden administration\u2019s move might be a moot point as a federal judge last week blocked the administration from enforcing the president\u2019s executive order that every federal worker must be vaccinated.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who has pushed an effort in Congress to defund vaccine mandates, also criticized the Commerce Department rule.\n\n\u201cFirst it was tracking religious dissenters, now it is those who \u2014 for the best interest of their health \u2014 are advised not to get the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d Roy told The Daily Signal in a written statement, adding:\n\nGuidelines from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, used by federal agencies, puts the processing of exemption applications on hold while an executive order has been enjoined.\n\nThe Daily Signal first reported Jan. 11 that the Biden administration was testing a policy at a small federal agency, the Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia, that likely would serve as a model for government-assembled lists of Americans who object to taking the COVID-19 vaccines on religious grounds.\n\nFour days later, The Daily Signal reported that 18 other federal agencies are considering doing so.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Jan. 13 rejected a Biden administration mandate requiring all private employers with 100 or more workers to make sure those employees are vaccinated or undergo regular tests for COVID-19. However, the high court upheld the administration\u2019s vaccine mandate for employees of health care facilities that accept Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn a separate action, Biden imposed the vaccine mandate on federal employees and contractors.\n\nAccording to the Federal Register, the process continues with two steps at the Commerce Department, explaining:\n\nThe agency will be required to keep confidential any medical information provided, subject to the applicable Rehabilitation Act standards. This medical exemption form is necessary for Commerce to determine legal exemptions to the vaccine requirement under the Rehabilitation Act. The form \u2018Request for a Medical Exception to the COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement\u2019 will be completed by employees who seek a medical exception to the federal employee vaccine mandate, and by their personal medical providers. To request a medical exemption from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, an employee must complete Part 1 of the medical exemption form and their medical provider must complete Part 2. The [department\u2019s] reasonable accommodation coordinators would receive this form from the requester and use it to make a recommendation to the supervisor based on the medical information provided in the form.\n\nThis development should concern liberals, libertarians, and conservatives, said Cully Stimson, deputy director of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation, which is the parent organization of The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThis means, in other words, the government will list every single person claiming a medical exemption,\u201d Stimson told The Daily Signal. \u201cEveryone who pushes back against this government overreach, even if a doctor says they can\u2019t take the vaccine, will be part of a list, which is really creepy.\u201d\n\nStimson said the Commerce Department probably will be a model for the rest of the federal government in adding the requirement.\n\nHe noted that the provision says that once an employee fills out the form, the \u201creasonable accommodation coordinators\u201d within the Commerce Department would use the form \u201cto make a recommendation to the supervisor based on the medical information provided in the form.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from the Commerce Department did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s phone and email inquiries Wednesday for this report.\n\nCollecting certain information is necessary, but employee privacy will be protected, an Office of Management and Budget spokesperson told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cTo process an employee\u2019s medical exception, agencies need to collect certain information, including, for example, the employee\u2019s name, the request for an exception and, if they are provided one, that they have been granted an exception,\u201d the OMB spokesperson said in an email, adding:\n\nThe Pretrial Services Agency will begin storing names and \u201cpersonal religious information\u201d of employees who make \u201creligious accommodation requests for religious exemption from the federally mandated vaccination requirement,\u201d Sarah Parshall Perry and GianCarlo Canaparo, legal fellows with Heritage\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, wrote in their Jan. 11 article in The Daily Signal breaking the news on the pilot program.\n\nPerry and Canaparo followed up Jan. 15 by reporting that 18 other federal agencies were considering making similar lists of religious objectors to the vaccine mandate.\n\nThis week, 41 House Republicans signed onto a letter to Biden accusing his administration of targeting Americans who seek religious exemptions, The Daily Signal\u2019s Mary Margaret Olohan first reported.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Government Expands List of Unvaccinated, Now Tracking Both Medical and Religious Exemptions -
