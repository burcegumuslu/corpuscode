According to research, these cells are oftentimes contaminated with hidden viral fragments which have the potential to cause cancer.\n\nThese viruses are dormant, meaning they live \u201cquietly\u201d inside other cells. However, eventually these cells no longer hide and circulate throughout the body in the form of serious disease. As a result, a person injected with a vaccine containing these cancer-causing micro-organisms may not display signs of health complications until long after they have been jabbed sometimes several years later.\n\nAn experiment injecting rodents with vaccines yielded surprising results showing that the rats now had tumor cells.\n\n\u201cIn some cases the cell lines that are used might be tumorigenic, that is, they form tumors when injected into rodents,\u201d the FDA paper explains.\n\n\u201cSome of these tumor-forming cell lines may contain cancer-causing viruses that are not actively reproducing. Such viruses are hard to detect using standard methods. These latent, or \u2018quiet,\u2019 viruses pose a potential threat, since they might become active under vaccine manufacturing conditions.\u201d\n\nThe list of tumorigenic or cells that run the risk of causing cancer include MDCK and CHO cells (for influenza virus vaccines), 293 and PER.C6 cells (for adenovirus-vectored HIV-1 and other vaccines), and tumor-derived cells such as HeLa cells (for HIV-1 vaccines) according to the FDA.\n\nAlthough this author is against the injection of foreign chemicals into his own body, the FDA proceeded with the study for other reasons. The FDA writes they want \u201cto ensure the safety of vaccines, our laboratory is investigating ways to activate latent viruses in cell lines and to detect the activated viruses, as well as other unknown viruses, using new technologies. We will then adapt our findings to detect viruses in the same types of cell substrates that are used to produce vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe FDA adds, \u201cThese methods will enable FDA scientists to help manufacturers to determine whether their specific cell substrate is safe to use for vaccine production. The methods our laboratory are developing and testing will help to ensure the production of safe and effective vaccines in two ways: 1) FDA will be able to develop testing guidelines for manufacturers who use new cell substrates for producing vaccines; and 2) FDA will publish the new methods it develops in peer-reviewed scientific journals, thus making them readily accessible to all manufacturers.\u201d\n\nThe FDA is also evaluating the risk of retrovirus infections in humans such as Simian foamy virus (SFV) which can be transmitted from monkeys to humans. Although, the FDA says \u201cthere is no evidence that SFV causes disease.\u201d However, the FDA cautions that the virus can \u201cremain in a lifelong quiet state in the DNA after infection.\u201d\n\nDespite these claims, we know that polio and smallpox vaccines contain monkey, pig, kidney and other foreign cells that are contaminated with SIV, SFV, and various other cancer-causing viruses. Most are also well aware that the Polio vaccine SV40 is documented on record by the CDC themselves (on a now-deleted page) to have cost people their lives and caused cancer. However, you can confirm the web page existed by using Archive.org\u2019s time machine. Also there\u2019s other evidence that SV40 has been detected in some human tumors.\n\nSo the claim made by the FDA \u201cthere is no evidence that SFV causes disease\u201d is a laughably ill-researched statement.\n\nIn other gene sequencing news, recently it has been reported by scientists in a separate study that there are 560 cancer genes in the human gene sequencing for GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s (GSK) combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV).\n\nCancer genes aren\u2019t the only worry with MMR vaccines or vaccines in general. As Activist Post has previously expressed, mercury and aluminum have long been debated by people like Robert Kennedy Jr. as ingredients (adjuvants) in vaccines that could cause autism. This is for good reason since we know that both aluminum and mercury are neurotoxins that harm the body at high levels.\n\nRFK, Jr. believes \u201cit\u2019s the preservative Thimerosal in the vaccines that causes autism.\u201d\n\nKennedy expressed his opinion in a weighty now-deleted piece on the CDC whistleblower entitled \u201cCDC\u2019s Latest Tuskegee Experiment African American Autism and Vaccines.\u201d (archive)\n\nThiomersal isn\u2019t the only ingredient in vaccines; they have admitted to traces of aluminum, which is classified as a neurotoxin to the body and stated that \u201cdespite using it for 90 years medical sciences\u2019 understanding about using aluminum as a vaccine adjuvant is remarkably poor.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Activist Post reported a previous separate study that confirmed aluminum in vaccines may cause Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and children who suffer from it have up 10 times more metal in their brains than what is considered a safe amount for adults. Those researchers discovered that aluminum causes the membrane to separate the brain from blood flowing to it, thus affecting its internal temperature, non-neuronal cells and inflammatory cells.\n\nAnother previous study in 2012, from the peer-reviewed medical journal Lupus by Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD and Christopher A. Shaw, PhD of the University of British Columbia corroborates those claims, indicating that aluminum toxicity targets the mitochondria. That experiment found evidence that aluminum as an adjuvant can lead to permanent detrimental alterations of the brain and immune system function.\n\nA court ruling in the UK found that the Swine Flu vaccinations had caused brain damage and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in multiple kids in 2015 who took the jab. Another case in an Italian court in September, 2014, \u201cruled mercury and aluminum in vaccines cause autism\u201d and awarded a plaintiff\u2019s family compensation for their young boy who developed autism from a six-in-one hexavalent vaccine manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. GSK even admits INFANRIX Hexa can cause several deadly illnesses, but insists that its risk-benefit profile \u201ccontinues to be favorable.\u201d In 2013, two kids were awarded millions by the vaccine court, confirming the MMR vaccine causes autism.\n\nThere are several additional court cases; although the CDC and pharmaceutical industry would love to have these covered up, I dug them up. One MMR clinical trial\u2019s results were faked by Big Pharma Merck. Merck knowingly falsified its mumps vaccine test results to fabricate a \u201c95% efficacy rate.\u201d In order to do this, Merck \u201cspiked the blood test with animal antibodies to artificially inflate the appearance of immune system antibodies,\u201d as reported by CourthouseNews.com.\n\nIn fact, regarding the use of aluminum and other metals in vaccines as an adjuvant, we may all be part of a 90-year-old experiment where we were all the lab rats.\n\nAluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science\u2019s understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community. We hope that the present paper will provide a framework for a much needed and long overdue assessment of this highly contentious medical issue. \u2013 US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe MMR vaccine isn\u2019t the only vaccine under scrutiny. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced there might be a link between miscarriages and vaccinations. The researchers found that women who had miscarriages between 2010 and 2012 were more likely to have had back-to-back annual flu shots including the Swine flu vaccine that a UK court ruled caused brain damage and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in multiple kids in 2015, as Natural Blaze reported.\n\nAt this point, the FDA effectively just inadvertently proved that jabbing yourself with a vaccine is the equivalent to trying Chinese research chemicals. Except that these deadly chemical combinations are approved by the FDA. The question on everyone\u2019s minds is, how wasn\u2019t any of this identified long before any of these vaccines were ever approved for use by the masses? Especially, the Polio and Smallpox vaccines which have injured and killed many over the years.\n\nWhere at first the problem may have been isolated to metallics (aluminum) used in vaccines that the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health has admitted their understanding of as a main adjuvant in vaccines is \u201cpoor.\u201d The new issue is vaccines that are made from living cells, or replicated cell substrates that may cause cancer or other serious diseases. Despite all this evidence, forced vaccinations are occurring in places like BC, Canada where, as Activist Post reported, parents have no choice but to vaccinate children. As this writer previously wrote, vaccines affect individuals differently and can have adverse side effects; now parents need to worry about deadly cells hidden beneath the vaccines that can cause illnesses.\n\nIs it ever really safe to put a foreign substance into your body when each person\u2019s body functions differently and has a different chemical make up? As RFK, Jr. says when it comes to vaccines: \u201cLet the evidence speak for itself.\u201d\n\nPRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
