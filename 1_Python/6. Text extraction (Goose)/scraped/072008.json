ASK ME ANY ?s\u201d\n\nPrior to threatening to shoot up her school, Copeny was being showered with praise for her Greta Thunberg-style public activism. Michigan-based corporate media just loved her, as did Biden and other social justice-driven entities.\n\nCopeny was even profiled by MLive for receiving the Billboard Music Awards Changemaker award last year. That profile reads:\n\n\u201cThe Billboard Music Awards Changemaker honor is given to pop culture figures that speak truth to power through their commitment to individual action and leadership. They are socially conscious, politically aware, ever-present in their community and charitable with time, crucial resources and influence to improve the lives of others,\u201d the awards organization stated.\n\nSince Greta Thunberg is already becoming something of a has-been in the world of climate activism, it only makes sense that Copeny, another \u201cchild star,\u201d was rolled out to take her place. One wonders: who will become the next underage youth star for the Democrats to trot about once Copeny loses her luster \u2013 which she maybe already has should she end up in prison for the next two decades.\n\nAccording to ABC 12, Copeny never bothered to follow through on her threat. Grand Blanc Community Schools reportedly sent all students home early that day, went into \u201csecure\u201d mode, and brought in more police presence. No further incidents occurred.\n\nMore related news can be found at Terrorism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Greta Thunberg wannabe \u201cLittle Miss Flint\u201d charged with 20-year felony for threatening to shoot up a Michigan school", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2023-01-31-greta-wannabe-little-miss-flint-felony-school-shooting.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "A 15-year-old Greta Thunberg fanatic by the name of Mari Copeny is being charged with a 20-year felony for threatening on Snapchat to shoot up a school in Grand Blanc, Mich. \u201cLittle Miss Flint,\u201d as Copeny also goes by on social media,\u201d was interviewed by fake president Joe Biden last year concerning the \u201cwater crisis\u201d [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.climate.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/381/2023/02/Greta-Thunberg-eco-fascist.png"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "violent activism", "left cult", "lunatics", "greta thunberg", "felony", "psycho", "SnapChat", "Little Miss Flint", "Biden", "extremism", "school shooting", "propaganda", "social justice", "Liberal Mob", "Mari Copeny", "domestic terrorism", "Dangerous", "Libtards"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://bigleaguepolitics.com/greta-thunberg-wannabe-little-miss-flint-is-reportedly-charged-with-20-year-felony-for-threatening-a-school-shooting/", "http://shootings.news", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-02-22-indian-activist-protest-toolkit-greta-thunberg-arrested.html", "http://terrorism.news", "https://bigleaguepolitics.com/greta-thunberg-wannabe-little-miss-flint-is-reportedly-charged-with-20-year-felony-for-threatening-a-school-shooting/", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-02-22-indian-activist-protest-toolkit-greta-thunberg-arrested.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fclimatenews%2F2023-01-31-greta-wannabe-little-miss-flint-felony-school-shooting.html&linkname=Greta%20Thunberg%20wannabe%20%E2%80%9CLittle%20Miss%20Flint%E2%80%9D%20charged%20with%2020-year%20felony%20for%20threatening%20to%20shoot%20up%20a%20Michigan%20school", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
