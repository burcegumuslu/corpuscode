And already there\u2019s been a handful of people busted at the \u201cstate border\u201d (legal questions of Constitutionality aside) attempting to enter the islands with a fake vaccine proof card.\n\n\u201cPeople are pressing their luck entering Hawaii with fake vaccination cards or test results, an offense that can carry jail time,\u201d The Hill reports. It\u2019s the vacation paradise destination that the Chicago woman with the \u201cMaderna\u201d card got caught this summer trying to enter. Also initially a father and son from California marked the first case that gained national attention.\n\nIn the latest incident, a couple in their 30\u2019s flew from Los Angeles with what\u2019s being described as faking a negative Covid test. The Guardian reports that \u201cAccording to a police statement last week, they uploaded false results into the state\u2019s system, which flagged the documents and prompted an investigation.\u201d\n\nThe travelers were subsequently arrested and sent back to California and are now awaiting a court date. The attempts to get around Covid testing and vaccine mandates are apparently geared toward avoiding a lengthy hotel quarantine stay at personal cost upon entering Hawaii.\n\nAs The Hill details, some people were caught falsifying vaccine cards even for their children \u2013 despite the underage children being ineligible to receive the vaccine in the first place \u2013 but now face stiff legal penalties, including the possibility of jail time:\n\nThe trend has been observed nationally. So far the most sophisticated fake vax record bust has come out of New York and Jersey, given in that prior instance one of the schemers had access to state computer records.\n\nAs we detailed in early September, a woman in New Jersey who was known to clients as \u201cAntiVaxMomma\u201d \u2013 which she goes by on Instagram \u2013 had been charged by police with offering false documents, criminal possession of a forged instrument and conspiracy. Police said she was known to have sold some 250 fake COVID-19 vaccine cards over the previous months for about $200 each in the New York City area.\n\nThe scheme was among the more elaborate ones uncovered of late, given that customers could offer $250 more for someone she was working with to enter the card buyer\u2019s name into a New York state vaccination database, according to ABC News. This would then grant the \u2018fake\u2019 card verification status if checked against state health systems.\n\nMeanwhile, within Hawaii the state has already rolled out a COVID vaccine passport for residents to access gyms, bars, and restaurants \u2013 akin to large US cities like New York and San Francisco. \u201cThe state calls it a digital smart health card and says it would work the same way as the Safe Travels vaccine exception, where people would have to upload a copy of the vaccination card to a secure website,\u201d local media detailed. However, at this early phase it\u2019s not yet fully mandated, but businesses are being encouraged to enforce it on their premises.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "One U.S. State Already Has a De Facto 'Vaccine Passport' Requirement Just to Enter", "description": "More and more people are facing fines and jail time for providing fake COVID-19 vaccine documents...", "url": "https://wearechange.org/one-u-s-state-already-has-a-de-facto-vaccine-passport-requirement-just-to-enter/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-10-09T04:41:22+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/rtuoitutut-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Woman Arrested Trying to Enter Hawaii With 'Maderna' Covid-19 Vaccine Card <a href=\"https://t.co/SckoI6vA4g\">https://t.co/SckoI6vA4g</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/V121PNCNHz\">pic.twitter.com/V121PNCNHz</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gizmodo/status/1433010762042073092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/575697-more-americans-caught-faking-vaccinations-to-sneak", "https://www.kauai.gov/Portals/0/Mayor/PIO/____2021929%20KPD%20NR%202%20Los%20Angeles%20travelers%20arrested%20for%20falsified%20travel%20documents.pdf?ver=2021-09-29-194419-817", "https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/575697-more-americans-caught-faking-vaccinations-to-sneak", "https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/08/12/2-mainland-travelers-arrested-honolulu-fake-vaccine-cards-ag-says/", "https://www.newsweek.com/man-could-face-7-years-prison-after-allegedly-submitting-fake-vaccine-card-job-1635769", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/antivaxmomma-sold-fake-vaccination-cards-could-get-verified-ny-state-database", "https://t.co/SckoI6vA4g", "https://t.co/V121PNCNHz", "https://twitter.com/Gizmodo/status/1433010762042073092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/da-ny-hospital-nursing-home-workers-bought-bogus-79751070", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/one-us-state-already-has-de-facto-vaccine-passport-requirement-just-enter", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2021-10-09T04:41:22+00:00"}
