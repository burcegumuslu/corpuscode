Leftists who say vaccines promote the \u201cgreater good\u201d now insist that ABORTION is a \u201cmoral good\u201d for society\n\nA rabid feminist and \u201cChristian social ethicist\u201d by the name of Rebecca Todd Peters recently hosted a lecture at Emory University in Georgia, where she tried to make the case that abortion is somehow a \u201cmoral good\u201d for American society.\n\nEntitled, \u201cReframing Choice: Abortion as a Moral Good,\u201d Peters\u2019 lecture focused on the \u201cright\u201d of women to murder their unborn children, and blamed \u201cracism\u201d and the \u201cpatriarchy\u201d for \u201cjudging and shaming\u201d women over abortion \u2013 but presumably has no problem with forcing everyone to get vaccinated for the \u201cgreater good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe starting point of our ethical conversation should be women\u2019s lives, [yet] the problem that we face in this country is our failure to trust women to act as rational, capable, reasonable moral agents,\u201d Peters, who works as a professor of \u201cReligious Studies\u201d at Elon University in North Carolina, writes in her book, Trust Women: A Progressive Christian Argument for Reproductive Justice.\n\nFor more related news, be sure to check out Evil.news.\n\nPeters has made the news before, including back in 2018 when she published a column on Elon\u2019s website suggesting that there\u2019s \u201cnothing Christian\u201d about being pro-life.\n\nEntitled, \u201cTrusting Women to Make Abortion Decisions is a Christian Norm,\u201d Peters\u2019 column laments that women shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cjustify\u201d their decision to murder their unborn children, adding that it\u2019s somehow anti-Christian to force women \u201cto continue pregnancies against their will.\u201d\n\nAn ordained \u201cminister\u201d within the Presbyterian Church USA, Peters holds a Master of Divinity (Mdiv) degree in \u201cChristian Social Ethics\u201d from Union Theological Seminary in New York.\n\n\u201cIf we truly value women and healthy families, we must accept that \u2018I do not want to have a baby\u2019 is an imminently appropriate reason to end a pregnancy,\u201d Peters\u2019 column goes on to say. \u201cAnd we must trust that pregnant women are the only ones who are capable of making these decisions.\u201d\n\nEmory University gleefully sponsored Peters\u2019 seminar on how abortion is supposedly a \u201cChristian value\u201d\n\nPeters was not only invited to speak at Emory on her \u201cChristian\u201d support for abortion, but the university\u2019s \u201cCenter for Women at Emory\u201d and \u201cEmory Reproductive Health Association\u201d also both contributed financially to make it happen.\n\nIn a statement to Campus Reform, Peters explained that her lecture would focus on \u201creframing the public conversation about abortion in this country\u201d \u2013 mainly pushing the ridiculous and blasphemous idea that Jesus Christ is somehow in support of women irresponsibly getting pregnant, then proceeding to murder their unborn children.\n\n\u201cMy hope for the lecture is that it will generate a respectful and productive conversation about abortion and reproductive justice,\u201d Peters added in a statement.\n\nCampus Republicans chastise Emory for using students\u2019 tuition money to fund Peters\u2019 blasphemous lecture\n\nIn responding to the event, Emory College Republicans told Campus Reform that its members were deeply disappointed in Emory\u2019s decision to support Peters\u2019 lecture, especially since the school would more than likely never support an opposing event featuring a speaker giving a lecture on how abortion is murder, and is 100 percent anti-Christian in every way.\n\n\u201cEmory GOP, of course, is very disappointed in the university\u2019s overt decision to support this event,\u201d a group spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we do respect the right \u2026 to speak about this topic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe actually have a few members that are going to the event to ask questions and encourage an important dialogue on the disastrous implications of this speaker\u2019s message.\u201d\n\nThe Leftist death cult, of which Peters is a member, is anything but Christian or moral.
