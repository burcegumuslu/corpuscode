During a recent television appearance, CNN host Don Lemon asked CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner if such a scenario is likely.\n\nThe discussions highlight certain realities of Covid immunization.\n\n\u201cImmunity wanes,\u201d Fauci said during a White House briefing on Tuesday, \u201cwhether that\u2019s immunity following infection or immunity following vaccine.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that immunization wanes, new scientific research from The New England Journal of Medicine suggests natural immunity lasts longer than immunity acquired from vaccines.\n\nThe study, a case\u2013control analysis based on data from Qatar collected from December 23, 2021 through February 21, 2022, involved millions of people, including 1,306,862 who received at least two doses of the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2) and 893,671 people who received at least two doses of the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273), as well unvaccinated individuals.\n\nThe results of the study are a mixed bag for the vaccines.\n\nThe best news is that \u201cany form of previous immunity, whether induced by previous infection or vaccination, is associated with strong and durable protection against Covid-19\u2013related hospitalization and death.\u201d (In other words, both vaccines and natural immunity reduce the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid.)\n\nAlso good news is that both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines \u201cenhanced protection among persons who had had a previous infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe combination of prior, full vaccination and prior infection was maximally protective,\u201d researchers said in a summary of the study\u2019s findings released last month by the Weill Cornell Medicine Newsroom. \u201cIndividuals with prior infection and three doses of either mRNA vaccine were, overall, nearly 80 percent protected from symptomatic infection during the Omicron wave.\u201d\n\nBut the study also found that two doses of vaccines offered \u201cnegligible\u201d protection against Omicron infection.\n\n\u201cA key finding was that a history of vaccination with the standard two doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine, but no history of prior infection, brought no significant protection against symptomatic Omicron infection,\u201d researchers said.\n\nIn regards to the Pfizer vaccine, three shots offered considerably more protection. But the protection was still lower than natural immunity, which offered stronger and more sustained protection from infection than vaccination. (Researchers noted that \u201cpeople with a prior-variant infection were moderately protected from Omicron with little decline in protection even a year after their prior infection.\u201d)\n\nThe findings are not unlike those out of Israel published last year, which found that natural immunity offered more robust protection against the Delta variant than vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe natural immune protection that develops after a SARS-CoV-2 infection offers considerably more of a shield against the Delta variant of the pandemic coronavirus than two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,\u201d Science reported in August 2021 in a piece exploring the Israel findings.\n\nMore than a dozen other studies also found that natural immunity offered powerful protection against Covid, equal to or stronger than vaccination.\n\nEven absent these findings, vaccine mandates were dubious from the beginning. The morality of violating bodily autonomy through government coercion is a serious and dangerous matter. In light of these findings, however, vaccine mandates also appear nonsensical.\n\nWhile many institutions now consider Covid infection a form of immunization \u2014 including the NCAA, which in January changed its policy to accommodate athletes who\u2019d had Covid \u2014 many have not. Thousands of soldiers have been discharged because of their vaccination status. Healthcare workers continue to face vaccination mandates in many places.\n\nIt\u2019s time for all institutions \u2014 especially governments \u2014 to recognize vaccination choices should remain with individuals. The idea that freedom over one\u2019s own body is the most basic and essential freedom is one embraced not just by libertarians like Ron Paul but by international leaders like Natalia Kanem, a physician who leads the United Nations Population Fund.\n\n\u201cBodily autonomy is the foundation upon which all other human rights are built,\u201d Kanem bluntly states.\n\nAll efforts to compel people to get vaccinated (or else) are coercive, and therefore wrong. But when the government, in particular, violates bodily autonomy for an alleged greater good, it betrays its very reason for being.\n\n\u201cThe only proper purpose of a government is to protect man\u2019s rights,\u201d the philosopher Ayn Rand noted.\n\nAs more studies like the research published by The New England Journal of Medicine come out, it becomes more and more clear that vaccine mandates were not just immoral. They were senseless.\n\nFortunately, many are beginning to realize just that.\n\nJonathan Miltimore is the Managing Editor of FEE.org.
