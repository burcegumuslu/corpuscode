The lawsuit alleges the CDC violated provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by failing to respond to CHD's FOIA requests to provide key analysis of reports in the vaccine safety database and intra- and inter-agency communications about those reports. CHD submitted the FOIA requests in the summer of 2022. The agency said the requested information would be forthcoming by December of last year, but the documents were never delivered.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/chd-lawsuit-cdc-covid-vaccine-vaers/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/chd-lawsuit-complaint-cdc-vaers-covid-vaccines.pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
