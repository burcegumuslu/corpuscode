Doctors at the Georgia Mental Health Forum at the Carter Center in Atlanta, where the data was presented, as well as several outside experts strongly criticized the use of medication in so many children that young.\n\n\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics standard practice guidelines for A.D.H.D. do not even address the diagnosis in children 3 and younger \u2014 let alone the use of such stimulant medications, because their safety and effectiveness have barely been explored in that age group. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely shocking, and it shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d said Anita Zervigon-Hakes, a children\u2019s mental health consultant to the Carter Center. \u201cPeople are just feeling around in the dark. We obviously don\u2019t have our act together for little children.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the fact that 10,000 American toddlers are being treated for A.D.H.D. is not surprising, considering that according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a whopping 5.9 million children 17 or under receive a diagnosis at some point in their lives.\n\nBut what is particularly disturbing is that this new data suggests that even the youngest Americans are being prescribed pills that can lead to addiction and liver toxification later in life.\n\nAnd for what? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, signs and symptoms of A.D.H.D. include having trouble focusing, being easily distracted, and unable to follow instructions. If doctors are prescribing toddlers pills for having trouble sitting still during dinner and playing with anything in sight, aren\u2019t they actually medicating toddlers for simply being\u2026 toddlers?\n\nWell, if you ask psychotherapist and investigative journalist Thom Hartmann, the A.D.H.D. epidemic is far more alarming than even this story suggests. In fact, Thom\u2019s research led him to conclude that the origin of the condition might be evolutionary and a result of adaptive behavior rather than the stigmatized disease society tells us.\n\nJournalist Thom Hartmann dispels the myths about A.D.H.D. and explains why it might be an evolutionary trait and not a disorder on Breaking the Set:\n\nWhy A.D.H.D. is Not a Disorder | Interview with Thom Hartmann\n\nCompiled and written by Abby Martin and Anya Parampil, photo by flickr user Life Mental Health", "opengraph": {"title": "10,000 Toddlers on Drugs for Non-disorder A.D.H.D.", "site_name": "MEDIA ROOTS \u2013 Reporting From Outside Party Lines", "type": "article", "url": "http://mediaroots.org/10000-toddlers-on-drugs-for-non-disorder-a-d-h-d/", "image": "http://www.mediaroots.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ad2new.jpg"}, "tags": ["abby martin", "adhd", "science", "thom hartmann", "big pharma", "INTERVIEWS", "evolution", "add", "breaking the set"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/yowurewU0qA\" width=\"560\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/yowurewU0qA"}], "links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/among-experts-scrutiny-of-attention-disorder-diagnoses-in-2-and-3-year-olds.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/among-experts-scrutiny-of-attention-disorder-diagnoses-in-2-and-3-year-olds.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/adhd.htm", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml#part3"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "May 20, 2014"}
