Lower-income countries left behind in the global rollout are now grappling with a lack of funds, hesitancy, supply-chain obstacles and other factors that are hampering distribution.\n\nBut outside of China and Hong Kong, COVID cases, deaths and hospitalizations have waned dramatically. This in turn has undermined demand.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, after more than a year of getting the short end of the stick from Western vaccine makers, developing nations have become resentful, as more consumers take the view that, if they have made it this far without the jabs, then they certainly don\u2019t need them now.\n\nWhile the African Union agreed to purchase 50 million doses during Q1, the organization opted not to acquire another 60 million doses in the second quarter.\n\nCovax, meanwhile, opted not to buy 166 million doses for delivery in Q3, and also turned down another alternative for 166 million doses in Q4. Although a spokesperson for the organization said talks for another round of purchases have continued to drag on.\n\nAfrica has the world\u2019s lowest immunization rate, with only 15% of the continent\u2019s population counted as fully vaccinated. That\u2019s compared with a global average of 57%, the WHO said last month. Only about 400 million of the more than 700 million doses Africa has received have been administered, leaving hundreds of millions of doses to rot on the shelves.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "African Union, WHO-Backed Covax Refuse to Buy Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines as Demand Plummets", "description": "Outside of China and Hong Kong, COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations have waned dramatically.
