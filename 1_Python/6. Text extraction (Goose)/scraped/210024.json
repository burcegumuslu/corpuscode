But,they also suggest a mechanism as to how this type of brain damage can occur.\n\nLatest research findings reveal a scary connection between brain damage and the hepatitis B vaccine\n\nPrior data from a team of researchers at the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology at Sun Yat-sen University in China 2018 reveal an alarming correlation:\n\nNeonatal exposure to hepatitis B vaccines is associated with neurobehavioral deficits and brain damage in rodent models. This is a pretty scary reality. But, to better understand the \u201chow,\u201d the researchers conducted a new study, recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Cytokine.\n\nIn this study, the authors focused on a specific type of immune cell known as cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4). IL-4\u2019s main role is to stimulate the immune system to create other types of immune cells in response to some sort of threat.\n\nInterestingly, it turns out that IL-4 is the MAJOR type of cytokine associated with exposure to hepatitis B vaccines. In other words, when an organism is injected with a Hep B vaccine, IL-4 serum levels rise dramatically.\n\nThis is a protective anti-inflammatory response against the drug and all the harmful toxins inside it \u2013 the body can\u2019t help but do this.\n\nBreaking down the very real danger of the hepatitis B vaccine\n\nStatistical analysis shows that when there\u2019s more IL-4 in the blood, there\u2019s also more IL-4 in the hippocampus \u2013 a part of the brain largely involved in emotion, memory, and regulation of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nUnfortunately, this kind of overexposure to IL-4 in the hippocampus can trigger a neuroinflammatory response, ultimately leading to brain damage.\n\nIt\u2019s here that the authors put two and two together:\n\nKnowing that IL-4 can pass the blood-brain barrier and trigger inflammation in hippocampus, and realizing that IL-4 levels SPIKE in response to a Hep B vaccine, the authors logically deduced that it could be the excessive amounts of vaccine-induced IL-4 itself contributing to post-vaccine brain damage in their animal models.\n\nTo figure this out, they injected infant mice with a rodent-version of IL-4 (no vaccine whatsoever). Their findings? As the authors put it, these mice had a \u201cneuroinflammation and cognition impairment similar to those induced by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination.\u201d\n\nKey point: Over-exposure to cytokine IL-4 can cause brain damage\n\nThe following points (below) highlight the main findings of this research:\n\u2022 Administering a hepatitis B vaccine stimulates the increase of cytokine IL-4 in the blood.\n\u2022 IL-4 then crosses blood-brain barrier, leading to inflammation in the hippocampus.\n\u2022 These elevated levels of IL-4 in the blood and brain can last for 4-5 weeks.\n\u2022 This prolonged inflammatory process can ultimately lead to brain damage plus cognitive and behavioral impairments.\n\nThe authors sum up their findings succinctly: \u201cThis finding suggests that clinical events concerning neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination\u2026may have adverse implications for brain development and cognition.\u201d\n\nIn the long-term, this could even be a possible mechanism for development of things like autism, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodevelopmental problems.\n\nSadly, the only thing, just as troubling about this news is that American mainstream media hardly seems to make a peep out of it.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hepatitis B vaccine dangers exposed | NaturalHeatlh365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) New research about the hepatitis B vaccine reveals how animal brains get damaged.
