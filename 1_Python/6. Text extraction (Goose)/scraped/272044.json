Well, that's the whole point, isn't it? Leaving the individual out of the equation. Treating the population like a single Blob.\" (The Underground, Jon Rappoport)Before we get to vaccines, I want to give you a quote about fluorides, just to set the stage.Stan Freni is a researcher who, in 1994, wrote a paper about fluorides, the substances in many toothpastes, also pumped intentionally into the drinking water of many communities and cities. Funny thing is, Stan Freni wrote his paper as an employee for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The title of the paper is \"Exposure to High Fluoride Concentrations in Drinking Water is Associated With Decreased Birth Rates.\" It was published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health (v.42,pp.109-121, 1994). Freni writes:\"A US database of drinking water systems was used to identify index counties with water systems reporting fluoride levels of at least 3ppm (parts per million)...the annual total fertility rate (TFR) for women in the age range 10-49 yr. was calculated for the period 1970-1988...Most regions showed an association of decreasing TFR with increasing fluoride levels.\"So don't imagine depopulation is an esoteric subject.Let's move on.You have to understand thatAnd not just a vaccine against the \"killer germ\" of the moment.\"... the true concern of Kissinger analysts [in Memorandum 200] was maintenance of US access to Third World resources. They worried that the 'political consequences' of population growth [in the Third World] could produce internal instability ... With famine and food riots and the breakdown of social order in such countries, [the Kissinger memo warns that] 'the smooth flow of needed materials will be jeopardized.'\"In other words, too many people equals disruption for the transnational corporations, who steal nations from those very people.Over the past five years,- and who knows what other vectors for the transmission of toxic elements to the population.Cockburn notes that the writers of the Kissinger memo \"favored sterilization over food aid.\" He goes on to say that \"By 1977, Reimart Ravenholt, the director of USAID's [] population program, was saying thatThere were unconfirmed reports from the Philippines and Mexico that their 1993 tetanus vaccination programs - which were supposedly administered only to women of childbearing age - involved multiple injections.Tetanus vaccine protocols indicate that one injection is good for ten years. Therefore, multiple injections would indicate another motive for the vaccinations - such as the anti-fertility effect of hCG planted in the vaccine. My inquiries to Philippine officials went unanswered.The Population Research Institute, in the November/December 1996 issue of its Review, published a report by David Morrison.Morrison stated, \"Philippine women may have been unwittingly vaccinated against their own children, a recent study conducted by the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) has indicated.\"The study tested random samples of afor the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone essential to the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy ... The PMA's positive test results indicate that\"The PMA notified the Philippine Department of Health (PDOH) of these findings in a 16 September letter signed by the researchers and certified by its President. Using an immunological assay developed by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, a three-doctor research panel tested forty-seven vials of tetanus vaccine collected at random from various health centers in Luzon and Mindanao. Nine were found to contain hCG in levels ranging from 0.191680 mIU/ml to 3.046061 mIU/ml. These vaccines, most of which were labeled as of Canadian origin,Morrison's article would seem to indicate that the vials of vaccine tested came from a widespread immunization campaign rather than from a small pilot study of a few women.The Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility Regulation was created at the World Health Organization in 1973. Ute Sprenger, writing in Biotechnology and Development Monitor (December 1995) describes the Task Force:\"...a global coordinating body for anti-fertility vaccine R&D...such as anti-sperm and anti-ovum vaccines and vaccines designed to neutralize the biological functions of hCG.\"There are other citations from published medical literature - but you get the idea: vaccines as depopulation instruments.And the hCG versions I refer to appear to be crude efforts. Who knows what levels of sophistication have been achieved in secret?To a highly significant degree, the, whose job is to convince the public that stepping up, rolling up their sleeves, and submitting to shots containing germs and toxic chemicals is the most natural and wise action possible.Yes, and ignorance is strength.The Matrix is designed inside out and upside down.Jon Rappoport is the author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED EXIT FROM THE MATRIX , and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX .
