This decision means that doctors are only allowed to administer the vaccines in exceptional cases and under specific conditions. However, doctors will bear the risk of liability for vaccination-related damage. This new guidance also has consequences for liability, with the federal government stepping in only if the damage was not covered by the vaccine manufacturer, the person vaccinating, or an insurance company.\n\nThe FOPH and EKIF have released a vaccination recommendation that outlines the current situation in Switzerland. The document states that in principle, there will be no recommendation for vaccination against Covid-19 in spring/summer 2023 due to the expected low virus circulation and the high level of immunity in the population. Vaccination is only possible in individual and unique cases, such as for people who are particularly at risk if the attending physician considers it medically indicated in the respective epidemiological situation. However, there is no specific vaccination recommendation provided even for individuals who are at risk.\n\nAccording to the Swiss government, there is no favorable risk-benefit ratio, as stated in the comments on \u201cAdverse Vaccine Reactions.\u201d The risk of severe adverse reactions with a recommended vaccination is much lower than the risk of a complication from Covid-19, against which the vaccination protects. The benefit of the vaccination administered according to the recommendation therefore outweighs the possible risks. However, with the new recommendations, there is no longer a positive benefit-risk ratio for any Covid vaccination.\n\nThe BAG document on the Covid vaccination strategy states that compensation by the federal government to injured persons for vaccination damage can only be considered for vaccinations if they were officially recommended or ordered. The person vaccinating, generally the doctor, can be held liable if they have breached their duty of care. This includes the duty to inform patients about all the risks and side effects and the limited effectiveness of the Covid vaccinations. However, the justification for vaccinations is becoming more difficult due to the changed recommendations.\n\nThe Weltwoche reports that from now on, doctors will be liable for deaths and injuries resulting from vaccinations, which means that their willingness to vaccinate is likely to decrease significantly. The new recommendations have caused confusion and concern among the Swiss population, as many people are now unsure about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. It remains to be seen whether other countries will follow Switzerland\u2019s lead and withdraw their vaccination recommendations.\n\u2022 Ghana Becomes first Country in Africa that Approves Oxford's new Malaria Vaccine\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\u2022 Next 'Mega Pandemic' Is Already Planned: HIV + SARS + H5N1\n\nDid you like this information?
