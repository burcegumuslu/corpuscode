Welcome to the World Council for Health general council meeting. We\u2019re very happy to have you join us. I\u2019m Dr. Jennifer Hibberd, and I will be introducing Dr. Christof Plothe of our steering committee, who will be hosting this session today. Before we go ahead with the official session, and this is of course, all part of our general council, I would like to bring forward Dr. Mark Trozzi to talk about his experience in Canada. He\u2019s a physician in Canada, and he has had a lot heat on him for very long time in Canada. And he is very much plugged in with the whole movement that\u2019s going on. And the convoy that\u2019s been parked in Ottawa and actually has been moving through cities throughout Canada. [00:01:29] And now we understand throughout the world, Mark, please come forward and please share your thoughts and your experiences. [00:01:35] Dr. Mark Trozzi: Thanks, Jennifer. And, uh, hope you don\u2019t mind me not using the video. My data stream is a little poor and I\u2019d rather that, uh, I can be heard clearly, so, oh yeah. [00:01:45] What a journey it\u2019s been for all of us around the world. A very similar situation. For me, it\u2019s been more than a year since I would have had to be a criminal or participate in criminality to maintain my job, uh, working in emergency department, as much as I love it. [00:01:59] Lots of activism has come together around the country, like around the world, this coalescing phenomenon where people that just, combination of critical thinking and self-respect, kind of lead the way. You know where we\u2019re at now, I mean, we have the World Council, we have many partner organizations around the world, including a lot of great organizations in Canada that, uh, that I have the honor of, of being a part of like Take Action Canada, Strong and Free Canada, and others. So there\u2019s certainly a great resistance. [00:02:26] But like everywhere, the criminals have dug their heels in. And just, I mean, just blatantly, I mean, we know from, from Pfizer\u2019s own data now that they knew last year as they were ordering these things, that they were ordering minimum 3% of the population, their deaths within three months. So, so we\u2019re at that point. [00:02:42] And most recently, they tried to shut the truckers out. We\u2019re already dealing with food shortages in Canada and things like that. So a lot of people rally together and, um, three convoys converged on Ottawa over several days. Has involved an estimated over a hundred thousand truckers. And a lot of people showed up and there was just a lot of love. [00:03:01] Great experts came and spoke and activists spoke. Justin Trudeau, the multiple time, in my opinion, criminal, person holding the office at least up until now. I hope that\u2019s changed at any moment now. I pray for it. That, uh, you know, he\u2019s properly arrested and whatnot because there\u2019s everybody asking for criminal charges against him. [00:03:19] And, uh, he claimed as the truckers are heading there rather than being a leader of any sort and talking to the people, he claimed that he found out he was near somebody who tested with a PCR positive for COVID. And so he had to go and obey his own rules and take off wherever he took off to and hid out. [00:03:36] So that\u2019s kind of the situation in Canada, rising up. We have to rise up and right now I plan to put out the Canadian charter bill of rights and analyzing that because folks, Brian Peckford is leading the way and we need to know our rights to hold our rights. Because stand completely with Dr. Nazeeba Kathrada and what she said. You know, we got to stand on our constitutions, we got charter of rights and we just do not accept this madness. So that\u2019s an update from Canada from my little perspective. God bless all. Thanks for having me. [00:04:04] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Mark, that was wonderful. Thank you so much. Now I\u2019d like to turn everything over to Christof. [00:04:11] Would you like to take over please. [00:04:13] Christof Plothe: Sure. Thank you very much, Jennifer. And thank you very much, Mark, for these encouraging words from Canada. I remember Professor Desimet when he was asked what differentiated people to think differently about our current situation. He said it\u2019s independent minds that did that prior to the situation, and who is more independent than truckers, I can say now, but who would have thought that truckers will change this narrative and not science or legal aspects? [00:04:40] So thank you very much, Mark, for this encouraging update. I hope it will lead as it was just mentioned the way for many truckers all over the world. Thank you, all truckers. So first of all, welcome to all partners, all our speakers and anybody tuning in from the newsroom and I\u2019d like to introduce the cohosts, Katrina Lindley and Shabnam Palesa Mohamed who will be with us tonight. [00:05:05] So let me just go through some basic information. First of all, there, we have a disclaimer that we\u2019re delighted to be hosting speakers from around the world on our platform and welcome different perspectives. We would like to point out however that the opinions of our guests speakers don\u2019t necessarily represent the opinions of the WCH. [00:05:26] This meeting is live and not rehearsed. Therefore errors and omissions are possible. As we are live, if you do not wish to appear, please turn off your camera now. Some friendly reminders. Please keep yourself mute during the meeting. Please adhere to the code of conduct to facilitate respect and open discussion to our partners in the meeting. [00:05:47] Please write your questions in the question and answer feature or in the chat. If you were watching through the newsroom, please be aware that you won\u2019t see the chat or cues for now. This is for participants only. [00:06:02] And thank you very much, a very warm thank you to all our coalition partners. We are a worldwide coalition of autonomous civil society groups, and health focused organizations who seek to broaden public health and knowledge and sense making through science and shared wisdom. All the ones you see here can be included partners for presenting from over 50 countries, from Australia to Zimbabwe, because only joined, we can reach our goals. [00:06:31] We\u2019d like to give you some updates of our different committees. Here is, uh, the one from the health of humanity committee. Number one, very positive feedback on the SAM 22 summit and the DC March, which you can rewatch on the WCH website. Article getting back to the basics of care, published and posted on the WCH website. And Rob introduced the concepts behind the Terrain theory article. The WCH has an oath of the medicals. [00:07:00] This is code recommended for all parallel, newly formed healing organizations in group. And Mark Trozzi introduced group to cornerstone science, a space for scientific papers to be published in peer reviewed. And the Youth 4 Humanity zoom meeting confirmed is the 1st of February. Invites to be circulated as soon as possible. [00:07:18] All groups encouraging as many as possible to participate. Healing through learning workshops are being planned. Then there\u2019s the mind and health committee update and that\u2019s a 28 day connection challenge on telegram starting on Tuesday. The 1st of February, everybody who is not yet on the telegram channels here with invited to join. We are writing an article all about the importance of connection and looking into the link between fear and mind health, how to understand and work with fear in our lives. [00:07:49] And then there\u2019s the update of the law and activism committee, which is that, um, uh, their approaches to education, solidarity and action. Understanding vaccine causation conference, the 5th of February. Uh, so you\u2019re all invited to please register on that. The round table discussion sociopolitical systems: [00:08:09] Do we reform current or create new? Planning a court guide and mock trials for experts in jab effected victims. Special welcome to our newest member, Dr. Jackie Stone from Zimbabwe, and please keep serving the WCH declaration on the injections with the cease and desist and notice of liability. To the meeting proceedings for tonight, our guest speakers, we will introduce him shortly, is Dr. Robert Malone and Kim Witczak, from the USA. There will be a newsfeed Updates from Canada, Singapore, and India. And we\u2019ll have an introduction to coalition partners. Ria Heslop-Hayes and Danee Dixon. And we\u2019ll have space for other Matters Arising. [00:08:55] So may I just introduce our first speaker, Dr. Robert Malone, he will be talking to us about the fundamentals and mechanisms of action of COVID-19 and genetic vaccines. I don\u2019t think there will be any reason to introduce Dr. Malone to most of us here. Uh, uh, especially after the Joe Rogan podcast where I, my latest figure was something like 50 million listeners. [00:09:20] Um, that was a wonderful event, um, and reached an amazing amount of people. A man with a great mind, a deep scientific knowledge and an open heart. Dr. Robert Malone is the inventor of the nine original mRNA vaccine patents, which were originally filed in 1989, including both the idea of mRNA vaccines and the original proof of principle experience and RNA transfaction. [00:09:43] Dr. Malone has close to a hundred peer reviewed publications, which have been cited over 12,000 times. Since January 2020, Dr. Malone has been leading a large team focused on clinical research, design, drug development, computer modeling, and mechanisms of action for repurpose drugs of the treatment of COVID-19. [00:10:03] There are lots of things to add, but, um, as we are shorten on time as always, um, I\u2019ll hand over to you, Dr. Malone, and thank you very much for joining us tonight. [00:10:14] Dr. Robert Malone: Thank you very much for the opportunity. [00:10:16] An honor to present here to your growing, amazing organization. I know you have a big dreams of, for supplanting, some other non-governmental organizations that have become dysfunctional, and we\u2019ll just leave it at that. [00:10:31] I\u2019m really heartened to see the growth in professionalism of the team that you guys have put together and in the broader community. So thank you for the opportunity to share this with you. The goal here is not to, uh, uh, uh, I come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him. Uh, no, I, I come here to share information, which I hope will help people to get over some of the fear and trepidation that they often seem to have as they encounter this new technology. [00:11:06] So this is intended to be a non-biased presentation of, of the tech, so that folks can better understand what we\u2019re talking about and be less prone to fear and, um, misunderstandings, uh, regarding the technology, uh, in particular, I think that we all are, are best served if we understand what we\u2019re talking about, and we\u2019re not, uh, focusing on red herrings or other things that [00:11:38] can distract us from, from our mission. So if we can move to the, oh, I should say, I need to put in the caveats. I serve as the president of the global COVID summit. That\u2019s the international Alliance of physicians and medical scientists, where we have a validated list of members that\u2019s over 17,000, uh, uh, sorry, uh, Thompson writers. [00:12:02] And, I also serve as the chief medical and regulatory officer of the unity project based in California. Unity project can be found as I showed on that first slide: unityprojectonline.com and we\u2019re the mission of that organization is to block the imposition of these illegal mandates for children, uh, to, uh, be required to receive these experimental medical products. Illegal in my opinion, in any case. [00:12:30] So then moving to that first slide, the central dogma of biology. So it\u2019s a diverse audience and I apologize to the physician scientists here, that I\u2019m having to drag through this, but for the rest of us, the central dogma of biology is kind of at the root of understanding this technology. [00:12:49] And that is that DNA makes RNA and RNA makes protein. Simple stuff. And traditionally, we always thought, we often think, of the double stranded molecule DNA as the one that encodes the genetic information that makes us who we are. In the case of RNA viruses, their genome is encoded on RNA. And of course the SARS cov two is a RNA virus. [00:13:14] So there is an enzyme associated with retroviruses, which can enable RNA to be used to produce DNA. That\u2019s called reverse transcriptase. And that\u2019s a hot topic for people that are concerned about the potential mutagenic effects of delivering mRNA into their cells. But I\u2019m not going to talk further about that at this point. [00:13:40] So I\u2019m going to kind of work you from left to right. First off on the left-hand panel. What we\u2019re showing there left-hand panel in the far right panel is kind of an enlargement of that. There are many forms of RNA. RNA is ribonucleic acid that\u2019s, it\u2019s just an acronym. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid. There are various functional forms of RNA. [00:14:09] One of those is to serve as a message. You can think of it as akin to a ticker tape, if you\u2019re old as me, many people won\u2019t remember that. You can think of it as akin to a Pearl necklace with, uh, each bead having a bit of information, but unlike in computers that, we\u2019re familiar with binary computers, uh, instead of only zeros and ones, we have four different bases. [00:14:34] A UGC in the case of RNA. RNAs can be used for different things. And they\u2019re used by the cell for different things. One of them is to serve as a scaffold in a sense, uh, with some catalytic components for the ribosome, which is this little cellular machine that, uh, produces proteins. One of them is to the transfer RNA, [00:15:01] so that\u2019s ribosomal RNA, or R RNA. One is to serve as a movable scaffold. That carries amino acids into the ribosome, and allows through base pairing the linkage of the appropriate amino acid based on the code that\u2019s in the messenger RNA. So those are called transfer RNAs cause they transfer amino acids. [00:15:28] So that\u2019s tRNA. And then there is the ribonucleic acid that has a message that instructs this whole symphony as to how to make a protein. And that\u2019s the messenger RNA. So first off we don\u2019t need to be afraid of, of this acronym, mRNA. It\u2019s nothing spooky or mysterious. It\u2019s merely an acronym for messenger RNA, which is one of the various forms that RNA takes. [00:15:54] Now we\u2019re going to move on to the structure of the virus itself and a couple of key components. This is a very simplified schematic, but it\u2019s useful. We have here highlighted the spike protein, and many of us are familiar with this. And now Moderna in the United States, as of today, has a license for producing spike vax, a vaccine, a mRNA vaccine which causes your cells to make spike protein. [00:16:23] So spike protein, as you can see from the schematic has various structural elements, including the receptor binding domain, which is the business end that enables the virus to attach to Ace2. But it\u2019s not the only protein. There\u2019s many other proteins associated with the virus. Both in the viral particles, [00:16:43] and when expressed, is included in envelope matrix nuclear capsid, proteins. And so you can see in this schematic, you know, roughly where they set the viruses envelopes. So it acquires lipids, uh, fats from the surface of your cells when it\u2019s produced. And, it has the mRNA condensed. Here it\u2019s shown as, uh, akin to a helix, such as is formed with DNA. [00:17:14] That\u2019s a very inaccurate representation of, of what the mRNA looks like, when it\u2019s from the virus, when it\u2019s bound to nucleocapsid protein. But this is a rough approximation to help people understand the basics. Okay. This is the hardest of these slides to walk through and understand, but this is the real business part of the mRNA vaccine technology or mRNA delivery technology. [00:17:43] And so there\u2019s three panels here. And since I\u2019m speaking to Canadians, I want to give a shout out to university of British Columbia and that group there that has really led in the development of the specific lipid structures that have a nitrogen with three carbons on them. That\u2019s a tertiary mean as opposed to the ones that I used for the original inventions, and then subsequently developed further during the nineties, which are all quaternary amines. They have four different carbons on the nitrogen. [00:18:20] The significance of that nitrogen is that it carries a positive charge, depending in the case of the, um, Peter cholas UBC, uh, technology that is a pH sensitive, positive charge. So it changes from a neutral to positive, depending on the surrounding pH in which it\u2019s placed the, the diluid. Um, or the cellular fluid. In the case of the original work that I did, we used a quaternary amine [00:18:52] that\u2019s always positively charged. This seems to be a significant advance that\u2019s enabled the, uh, activity of these particles in animals. So what you see in this panel in the upper right, is a series of these various catatonic lipids, positively charged fats that are synthetic. They are not normally found in your body. [00:19:15] These are drugs, and, uh, they are membrane active. They insert themselves into your cellular membranes as part of the process that results in the RNA being transferred into your cells so that it can then be loaded onto ribosomes and used to produce protein, like we were just talking about in their prior slide. [00:19:39] So these are examples of these lipid structures. If you\u2019re not familiar with organic chemistry, it\u2019s probably kind of jibberish, but, uh, what matters is that these have been empirically designed. You can\u2019t go to a computer modeling program and punch in: I want a canonic lipid that will target the liver. [00:20:00] For instance, these are, are produced synthetically by organic chemists, purified and then formulated with RNA and tested in various ways. So these are the ionizable lipids. If you look at the left part of that panel, uh, in the schematic and they\u2019re either ionizable or in the original embodiment, they were, uh, always positively charged. [00:20:25] Now, you\u2019ll see in that left-hand panel of the helper. Phospholipid this is typically polyethylene glycol. Um, uh, I\u2019m sorry. Uh, this is a dialell, dialellell, Pollic D-O-P-E. Um, uh ethanolamine uh, and this is, these are lipids that when, when formulated with other lipids help form a lipids, uh, layer and are intrinsically fusogentic. That means that when the particles come in contact with your cells, the membranes from the particles will fuse with the membranes of your cells. [00:21:05] So, finally, I\u2019ve got it: dialale phosphatidyl ethanolamine, or D-O-P-E, is a typical helper phospholipid. Then in the left, you\u2019ll look below that. It says cholesterol. Cholesterol are often included in these formulations and in these ones that are being used for the vaccines, because it increases the fluidity of the membrane [00:21:26] that\u2019s used to wrap the RNA. Then you see in that schematic, the MRN, and then below that is a key component that often people are confused about, lipid polyethylene glycol. So what\u2019s happened here. Polyethylene glycol is used to create, basically, structure the water around these particles. So in a sense, it\u2019s a little bit more like ice, but it\u2019s a very slippery ice. That helps keep liposomes, uh, polyethylene glycol can be used to keep liposomes from being cleared in the liver so they can circulate for a long period of time. [00:22:06] But in the case of these formulations, we have a very short, uh, carbon side chain on the polyethylene glycol, such that it is able to anchor into the formulation but it becomes disassociated upon injections. So for those patients, that experience, uh, the, um, acute anaphylaxis associated with, uh, administration, sometimes that\u2019s associated with this polyethylene glycol component. [00:22:34] Some people are sensitive to that. It\u2019s used in many different foods. It\u2019s generally considered to be, uh, safe. It\u2019s used in other liposome formulations like Doxil, uh, for cancer treatments, et cetera. But in the case of these formulations, the reason it\u2019s in there is because these complexes will aggregate quickly upon addition of the diluent. [00:23:00] The way these are prepared is the vials are shipped in a form, uh, that they\u2019re not ready for injection. And then you have to add a saline mixture and then resuspend them, and then use them within a fairly short period of time. If you don\u2019t do that, they aggregate, which is not a good thing for your patients because they form a large complexes that are both less active in delivering the RNA and more inflamatory. [00:23:32] So they [00:23:33] can cause more side effects. So the lipid peg is in there to stop that aggregation process, but it isn\u2019t firmly anchored into the particle. And so it can fall off and you can get aggregates. So that\u2019s the key components of the formulation. And you can see in the schematic as a rough approximation. What happens is the RNA is negatively charged. [00:23:58] Remember I used the metaphor, it\u2019s like a string of pearls and you can think of this, the rope in between each Pearl is negatively charged. And then these lipids are positively charged. So they\u2019re driven to associate with each other, just like magnets, uh, positive and negative pole. We call it, um, ionic interactions. [00:24:18] And so when you make these mixtures, the RNA gets coated with the positively charged molecules, lipids, fats, and then those become aggregated and associated into particles. And the size of those particles are controlled through the formulation process. You can use various technology, including basically pushing the mixture through a very small orifice, which is why there\u2019s pumps involved in producing these final formulations. [00:24:49] And that gives rise to the final product that\u2019s injected into yourself or your patients. In the lower left panel, there\u2019s some additional nuance here that some people, for instance, one of the scientists testifying at the recent Ron Johnson hearing, got a little crossed up over because he didn\u2019t understand some of these fundamentals. [00:25:09] So in the upper part of that left lower panel, you see a colored strand labeled mRNA, and it has various components, a cap, the five prime UTR, a coding region, or, or open reading frame, a three-prime UTR and the poly a tail. For those that are not, you know, haven\u2019t spent their life obsessing over these things, [00:25:32] this all seems rather mysterious. I\u2019m going to walk you through what it is so that you, that kind of mystery is, is demystified for you. The cap at one end of the RNA, that\u2019s the five-prime end of the RNA, is where the ribosome gets loaded. Remember we talked about ribosomes before. So the ribosome in order to get loaded onto the RNA or vice versa, depending on how you look at it, requires a, a special chemical modified nucleotide that we call the cap. [00:26:04] And that cap also protects that end of the RNA from, uh, enzymes that would chew it up, like Pac-Man from the end. That cap is followed by a stretch of RNA called the five prime untranslated region, which function is still not completely understood, but it\u2019s known empirically that these five prime untranslated regions are essential for efficient production of protein off of a mRNA. [00:26:32] And this [00:26:32] was one of the things that I demonstrated in my original paper. This is followed by the coding region or open reading frame. And just to say it, although, uh, the Pfizer dossier, that Biram originally captured from the Japanese regulatory authority, uh, in codes, the luciferase protein, which is a protein that makes the Firefly tail glow. [00:26:59] It has nothing to do with the devil. In the case of the, in Pfizer was allowed to use that as a surrogate for the vaccine, uh, actual vaccine product. In the vaccine product the open reading frame is what we call code on ma optimized so that it is engineered to produce as efficiently as possible [00:27:22] the spike protein and it\u2019s actually a modified version of spike protein. We\u2019ll go into that in a minute. The three prime untranslated region is also important and seems to interact with the five prime untranslated region in ways that aren\u2019t completely understood, but in order to have efficient translation into protein of these mRNA sequences, optimized three prime untranslated region is necessary. [00:27:46] That\u2019s also involved in stabilizing the RNA. And then this is followed by the poly adenyla tail, poly (A) tail. The poly (A) tail is kind of like a fuse that controls how long the RNA stays in the cell. Now that\u2019s a caveat that\u2019s in the normal situation. In the case of the marketed vaccines that we have in north America, the, uh, use uricells or uridines that are present in the mRNA naturally have been substituted for modified chemical compound called pseudo uridine. [00:28:24] And we really don\u2019t know a whole lot about the stability of those in your own cells. So when you ask me the question, how long does the RNA stick around after it\u2019s been delivered? I have to give you the \u201cduh\u201d I don\u2019t know, because I haven\u2019t seen any papers that document that response. So now we\u2019ve walked through the structure of the RNA, and then below that, in that panel, you can see a schematic that\u2019s really, uh, quite crude, showing the RNA sitting within one of these lipids, uh, um, the secular complexes with polyethylene glycol and its surface. [00:28:59] That\u2019s really quite crude. On the lower right, is a better approximation in which we have the RNA coded by the positively charged lipids. And then those aggregates coated by more, uh, membrane lipids that include the polyethylene glycol on their surface. So that\u2019s a closer approximation, but these are, when you hear about the lipid nano particles, uh, this is what we\u2019re talking about, and yes, they are typically highly inflammatory. [00:29:28] And that\u2019s been known for decades. Actually when I first met Katie Carrico, it was at a meeting that I had organized where I first disclosed, uh, how highly inflammatory these complexes are. The next slide: Intended Biodistribution. So the nuance here is that in the literature, based on rodent studies, there was a belief that, remember I showed you those different lipid structures, that the different lipid structures would confer targeting to different tissue sites, um, bone marrow liver, uh, and draining lymph nodes, for example, and the lipids that were chosen for these formulations were believed to have characteristics not really understood, but functionally determined that led to the RNA complexes, moving to the draining lymph nodes and delivering the RNA into antigen presenting cells in those draining lymph nodes. [00:30:26] So it was believed that this was going to be a safe process where the mRNA vaccine composed of the, that we\u2019ve described the structure of, would be injected, and then it would drain to those lymph nodes. It would not go all over the body and it would elicit an immune response in those lymph nodes by educating B and T cells. [00:30:46] Unfortunately, that turns out not to be the case. And, we learned that through the, again, the Pfizer dossier, that Byron Bridle kindly shared with the world. So he\u2019s a hero as far as I\u2019m concerned. And another thing that Canadians should be proud of, uh, but that was the belief system when this was presented to the FDA and the regulatory authorities, but then the data, limited data, that was generated in road models demonstrated that that absolutely was not the case. [00:31:15] So that had been, uh, proposed to be a safety feature, but I wanted to help you to understand that, just because that things, these things empirically behave that way in mice doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to behave that way in humans. And that seems to be the case here. I hope you\u2019re all still with me and I haven\u2019t put you to sleep yet with this very academic presentation. [00:31:36] This panel shows the graphic of a very simplified version of what happens with these particles. The graphic kind of flows from the upper left and then in an arc through to the upper right and center. Starting at the upper left, you have a schematic, the simplified schematic of these RNA lipid complexes, and they\u2019re typically formulated so that they have an excess positive charge. [00:32:04] Remember I said, the fats, the synthetic fats are positively charged at, uh, the pH is that are, um, exist outside of a cell. And, uh, so what happens is that cell membranes are generally negative. These are generally positive. And so once again, they\u2019re driven to associate by ionic interactions like two magnets and they glom onto your cell membranes. [00:32:31] And once they do that, those fusogentic and lipids like the, uh, dialayolel phosphatidyl ethanolamine that I mentioned, uh, as well as the candidate Libin structures cause these to fuse and, um, become integrated into the cell membrane of the cell that the particle has, has hit. So then the synthetic lipids become part of that cell\u2019s outer membrane, and the RNA is, is released or disgorged through a process. It\u2019s not really fully understood. [00:33:03] It becomes unpacked from these lipids and then, uh, gets transported to the ribosome. I\u2019m not aware. There\u2019s discussion about, since some of the untranslated regions are derived from sequences are related to sequences involved in, um, mitochondria there\u2019s discussion that maybe they\u2019re being producing protein, spike protein in mitochondria. [00:33:27] I\u2019m not aware of mRNA targeting sequences that would cause that to happen. I think that\u2019s another red herring, but I, you know, I haven\u2019t seen the data one way or another about that. In any case, they do find their ways to the ribosomes that are typically arrayed along this structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. [00:33:48] And then are, as I mentioned before, they are used to produce proteins. Those proteins are spike protein that are inserted into the Lumina of the ER. And then that\u2019s processed through the golgi apparatus where, uh, sugars are added and other things. And then once it\u2019s produced in the golgi and processed, then those spike proteins have one of two pathways. [00:34:14] They can end up being inserted onto the membrane of the cell that is transfected as a whole protein. And then they become targets for immune response, potentially, and also can be involved in educating B and T-cells to do their business, or they can be cut up into fragments. There are, uh, proteases in the cell and virtually every protein that\u2019s produced in the cell gets cut up into little tiny pieces and displayed on class one and/or class two major histocompatibility complex molecules, which by the way, are highly variable in humans. [00:34:50] This is a good thing that we have diversity in humans and diversity in our immune response. Those that interact with T cells and are involved in the T education program that, that produces finally T affector cells like cytotoxic, T lymphocytes. There, we got through that, um, that was a mouthful of immunology. [00:35:11] This is just another, kind of, easier version. It\u2019s looking at the system at kind of a higher level. The cell with all of the little blebs and podocytes sticking out of it, is a crude approximation of an antigen presenting cell. There\u2019s various types of cells that produce antigen and present it in educate T and B cells. [00:35:35] Dendritic cells are among the more potent of those, uh, monocytes and other macrophage can also do this. And there are some more fibroblasts like cells in lymph nodes that do this. So the thesis for this mechanism of action is that the RNA lipid protein complexes, I shouldn\u2019t say, lipid nano particles interact with entered and presenting cells and transfect, or produce the protein, deliver the RNA and produce the protein and those cells. That is a gross over simplification. [00:36:07] That happens to some extent, but these particles also produce protein in a variety of other cells in your body. And we know that to be true, both from multiple research papers over the last 30 years, but also, uh, functionally with, again, the, uh, documents that Biram obtained from Pfizer. Uh, by the Japanese, but in theory, the protein is produced on these antigen presenting cells. [00:36:36] And then they educate both CD eight cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD four helpers and B cells, and activate those to differentiate in the case of B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. In the case of T-cells, they produce effector T cells that are able to kill infected cells. It\u2019s important to remember that this virus doesn\u2019t just spread in an extracellular fashion, but it also spreads directly from cell to cell by a membrane fusion event. [00:37:08] So once a single cell is infected in your body, then the virus spreads laterally across adjacent cells. It doesn\u2019t have to get outside of a cell and therefore when it\u2019s spreading laterally, it\u2019s really not so susceptible to antibody interactions and blocking. Important also is that this process of B and T activation results in a population of memory cells that get parked and are able to be reactivated [00:37:41] if you encounter a similar pathogen in the future. Now that\u2019s important. We\u2019ll talk about that in a minute. When we talk about original antigenic sin. So with this slide, I\u2019m just emphasizing that in addition to the mRNA technology, we have another technology that\u2019s licensed in various Western countries, and the former Soviet union Russia has its own version of this tech. [00:38:08] This is the use of a cold virus, which happens to be a DNA virus. It\u2019s called an adenovirus. We\u2019ve all been infected by adenoviruses previously. Just like we\u2019ve all had a common beta Corona viruses infecting us. Adenoviruses, as I mentioned, are DNA viruses and what\u2019s done is to, uh, cut out sequences from those DNA viruses replace the spike protein into that DNA, and then use these to infect your cells rather than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles. [00:38:44] What matters here is that since it\u2019s a DNA virus, the DNA does go into your nucleus. And this technology was designed originally for gene therapy purposes. And so it produces protein at a high level for a long period of time. Again, I haven\u2019t been aware of any regulatory documents that have defined exactly where these adenoviruses go and for how long they produce the protein and how much spike protein is produced. [00:39:12] But that\u2019s the tech. It\u2019s otherwise very similar. It\u2019s just a different platform for delivering the genetic information, encoding the modified spike protein. Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about what that spike protein is. I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of being fact-checked by Thomson Reuters repeatedly over these topics. [00:39:34] The spike protein that is produced in these vaccines is a modified spike protein. It has two proline amino acids substitutions. They\u2019re in the S2 region, which is down the lower part. If you think of that tail, that sticking at the bottom in the lower panel which anchors the spike protein into the membrane of cells and this two proline mutations, I\u2019m sorry Reuters, were not introduced to make this less toxic. [00:40:06] They were introduced to make it more immunogenic. And what those two proline mutations do is to make it so that the spike stays locked into a pre fusion confirmation. So it is not able in theory to trigger the fusion between cells that normally would happen with the viral infection or with the cell, the cell spread. [00:40:31] These were not introduced to make it less toxic. Various mechanisms are involved in the toxicity as spike protein. Again, I apologize Reuters, but, uh, the sciences, the science, um, and, uh, one of those mechanisms of action is that spike binds to this key regulatory protein called ACE two. It\u2019s involved in regulation of blood pressure and many other things. [00:40:58] Receptor binding domain of spike remains intact and the rest of the core component of spike, it\u2019s only two amino acid changes that are introduced. And, fairly large protein, globular protein, and the receptor binding domain remains intact, which means it\u2019s still as able to bind to ACE two, the vaccine spike as the native spike. [00:41:25] And so any of those toxicities that are associated with that binding to ACE two in triggering ACE two activation remain with the spike encoded from either the virus or the vaccine. An important topic, I\u2019m just going to give you a sidebar on this, in terms of people ask, well, if, if you\u2019re getting spike from the vaccine and you\u2019re getting spike from the virus, what\u2019s the difference. [00:41:53] One key difference is that when you\u2019re infected by the virus, it\u2019s typically infecting the cells lining your nose and your mouth initially. And then it may migrate down into your lower lungs, although much less so with Omicron. It stays in your upper airway predominantly, which is a good thing. But what happens is you\u2019re initially infected by a small number of particles and they gradually spread and you have a gradual increase in the level of spike protein that your body is experiencing. [00:42:24] And of course at the same time, your body is mounting an immune response and spinning up its capabilities. So there\u2019s kind of a dance occurring between your immune system and the virus that results in a gradual escalation of the level of spike with infection and a gradual escalation of your immune response. In the case of the mRNA or the Adenovirus vaccines, [00:42:49] what you\u2019re having is a large amount of this protein being produced in a tissue site that it normally would not be produced in. And then it\u2019s being released and circulating in your body. We know that because of the Harvard and Brigham and women\u2019s study and nurses early on in the outbreak, when the vaccines were first being tested, that showed that the cleaved free spike circulates in the blood for a very long period of time, upwards of a month in many patients that is detectable. [00:43:23] This requires a sensitive biomedical, uh, biochemical essay and it has limits of, of detection. So we\u2019ve talked a little bit about spike protein and its structure and the specific mutations that are incorporated for purposes of generating the vaccines. And then the last thing I want to mention about spike is, for those of you that are Fishermen or Fisher persons, I guess I should say, if you know the structure of a trouble hook, that you might use with the bass plug, I think I can talk to this with Canadians, or you\u2019re going and catching stripers, [00:44:02] you may be familiar with the trouble hook. Spike is a trimor of proteins and it assumes a similar formation. So in the lower right aspect of that lower panel that the arrow points to, you\u2019re looking at the top of the spike. You\u2019re looking down the barrel of spike and you can see it has these three lobes that stick out. [00:44:23] Those are akin to the three barbs on a trouble hook. And the difference between the kind of the, where the treble hook metaphor breaks down is that each of these three lobes that sticks out like that is actually on a hinge. It\u2019s flexible, and those are the receptor binding domain. So you can think of this as kind of a three lobed book structure that grabs onto the ACE two receptor when the virus hits your cells or when the free spike protein potentially hit SES two. [00:44:54] The thing I really like to emphasize with this panel is the size of the antibody relative to the size of the spike. And so if you look at that upper center panel, the part that\u2019s kind of pink and red, that\u2019s a space filling diagram of an antibody that is matched to the thing that it\u2019s touching, which is a space filling model of the spike protein. [00:45:19] So you can see that in terms of the size, if you\u2019re thinking that there\u2019s hundreds of antibodies that are binding to spike, that\u2019s just not possible because they\u2019re about the same size. So with any one spike protein, you might get one or a very small number of antibodies interacting with it. In the upper right panel, [00:45:39] what you see is a schematic that shows the receptor binding domain. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s highly colored with purple and yellow and green, and those are all identified antibody binding domains that will interfere with the ability of spike to bind to cells. There\u2019s another little antibody binding domain down near the bottom [00:45:59] that\u2019s in blue there. And that one is broadly neutralizing. So antibodies directed against that are likely to be active against Omicron or the original alpha variant, et cetera. Those are very difficult to generate. In many people they will not produce antibodies against that target because it\u2019s kind of hidden by the virus in terms of the structure. [00:46:23] In the left lower, we have a more colorized version showing, as we\u2019re looking down the barrel of spike or looking at it sideways. And in that middle lower panel, you can see what we call a ribbon diagram that shows that same thing. So we have these three lobes that stick out that include the receptor binding domains and this central channel that is associated with the triggering of the fusion events. [00:46:52] This I\u2019m getting now towards the end of the presentation, where it\u2019s slide 12 of 15 and here, we\u2019re talking a little bit about T cell immunity. What matters here. What I\u2019d like to emphasize is the schematic in the panel in the lower left, the immune response against associated the memory cells associated with people [00:47:18] that are not exposed to COVID, the SARS-CoV-2, but have been exposed to prior beta coronaviruses. So that\u2019s the virtually all of us, we all had preexisting immunity against various proteins that are listed here. Nonstructural spike in M proteins that are from an immune system basis. They\u2019re very similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. [00:47:46] And so we had memory cells from those prior infections. Remember I talked about memory cells. So those memory cells that were parked, when you first get exposed to COVID-19 virus, the SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease COVID-19, that causes those memory cells to expand and start producing effector cells. [00:48:08] And so initially in your infection, if you haven\u2019t been previously infected or have not received the vaccine, what you\u2019ll predominantly do is generate both B and T responses that are designed for a prior virus. And so they are partially effective, but really often act in a way that interferes with any new antibodies that might be more specific for SARS-CoV-2. [00:48:38] This is a phenomenon that\u2019s well-known in immunology and in your daily life, you all understand that the things that you\u2019ve been exposed to, the situations you\u2019ve been exposed to, will bias how you respond to new, um, new events. So for instance, just taking a slightly sardonic point of view, my having been exposed to a hostile press over the last two years has made it so that I\u2019m very wary about interacting with any reporters, for some reason. [00:49:09] And, uh, that might be a good thing, or it might be a bad thing. Maybe I would be interacting with a reporter that would have actually done a good job and been friendly. So our prior exposures can bias our future responses. And that\u2019s true of your immune system. If you understand that you now understand original antigenic sin, the antigens and viruses that you\u2019ve been exposed to previously will bias how you respond to things in the future. [00:49:38] And by the way, that\u2019s also true with a mismatched vaccine, which is what we have right now. You are immune to reporters now, uh, not completely free, but getting there. In the upper panel there, what you\u2019re seeing is an example, a schematic of the types of immune responses that are generated with natural immunity after exposure and infection by SARS-CoV-2. [00:50:02] And you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s demonstrating there that you get a broad immune response, both antibodies and effector T cells to a variety of different proteins. And this is one of the issues with the vaccines is that they\u2019re generating these genetic vaccines that we have will elicit both a T N N effector in antibody response, [00:50:26] but those responses are not mucosal because you\u2019re not encountering the antigen through your normal mucosal route. And, they are biased only towards the spike protein and they\u2019re biased towards the spike protein from a virus that\u2019s no longer circulating because they\u2019re mismatched vaccines. [00:50:49] So the combination of these effects and the problems with original antigenic sin, I believe are what\u2019s driving the poor durability of the vaccines. So that\u2019s a huge difference between the natural immunity and the vaccine induced immunity is the natural immunity as much broader, longer lasting and against many different antigens, as opposed to the single antigen. [00:51:13] Now I\u2019m trying to move quickly. I have just a couple more slides. The next slide emphasizes this point that the natural immunity is against up to fifty four different proteins, both nonstructural and structural. Whereas the vaccine immunity is against only one protein, the spike protein. Then the next panel is just kind of a wrap up of a key point that I believe strongly in. [00:51:41] And I believe there\u2019s over 140 references that support the thesis that natural immunity is more protective and more effective. And, you can find a very nice article about that in the brownstone Institute library of articles. I just wanted to emphasize here that, in my opinion, it is essential that we recognize that natural immunity is more effective, that we should give allowance for those that have recovered, which have better immune responses than those elicited by a mismatched vaccine. [00:52:18] They\u2019re more durable, more effective, less likely to be evaded by a viral evolution. And furthermore, those that have generated natural immunity are susceptible to greater numbers in a severity of adverse events if they are subjected to genetic vaccination after generating natural immunity. [00:52:41] So with that, I have sucked up, um, the better part of an hour, I guess. I apologize for that. Thank you for your time and attention. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to, uh, buzz out now. And I don\u2019t have time for questions because I have to go give testimony to a judge advocate general here, uh, on Hawaii about some of the issues associated with the licensure packages and the adverse events that have been observed with these vaccines. [00:53:07] But I hope this was helpful. And if, if it has resulted in you having less anxiety and about the technology and a better understanding, then I\u2019ve succeeded. [00:53:20] Dr. Kat Lindley: Thank you, Dr. Malone for your presentation. And if possible, we will email you some questions from you to maybe answer. We can send them over to affiliates and members to look over later. [00:53:32] Pierre Kory: Hi Kat, it\u2019s Pierre. [00:53:35] Dr. Kat Lindley: Hi Pierre, [00:53:36] thank you for coming in. [00:53:38] Pierre Kory: I\u2019m here on a Hawaii with Robert. We also have to give testimony. So I just wanted to, to just pop in and say a couple of words, is that okay? [00:53:47] Dr. Kat Lindley: Yes, please. Go ahead. [00:53:49] Pierre Kory: So I think I was asked to just talk about what\u2019s going on in Canada and the trucker\u2019s, um, I cannot believe what is going on. [00:54:00] I mean, I just love it. The truckers are showing up. They\u2019re making a splash. People are paying attention, but at the same time, the world has gone mad. The truckers are saving Canada, the collapsed, failed totalitarian state of Canada, and the truckers are showing up. I just love it. I think there\u2019s, there\u2019s, there\u2019s some plans to get a convoy of American truckers to meet them at the border. [00:54:22] And I hope that happens. Um, just, you know, you guys know me, I just, it\u2019s just absurd. I can\u2019t verify this, but I was told the other night that CNN, when they covered the convoy in Canada, they said that it was a protest against icy roads in Canada. Are you guys all laughing? Please laugh with me. They are protesting icy roads in Canada. [00:54:48] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: You\u2019re right. It was ridiculous. They weren\u2019t ready for it, right. [00:54:52] They weren\u2019t ready for this. [00:54:53] Pierre Kory: Hey Jennifer, I\u2019m so sorry about your icy roads in Canada. I\u2019d never knew such thing could happen. What, what a catastrophe, but I just wanted to say I\u2019m with you guys. You guys are the best. It\u2019s not just the truckers. It\u2019s the Canadian COVID care Alliance and it\u2019s a bunch of other groups and, and you know what, the pictures are as loud as words and maybe even louder. [00:55:16] And I just hope everyone keeps speaking up, speaking out and, uh, you know, we\u2019re here to do the same with all you guys. And so you have our full support, man. Uh, oh my gosh, Canada, Canada. You guys need our help, man. You\u2019re your worst than United States, but, uh, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll bring you along. We\u2019ll we\u2019ll bring it to the light. [00:55:37] Definitely. [00:55:39] Dr. Kat Lindley: Thank you for your message. And thank you for joining us and thank you again, Dr. Malone. I think he is still there and we will email him the questions and then post the answers to all of those questions. [00:55:53] Dr. Robert Malone: Thanks Kat. Um, be good and, uh, stay strong. [00:55:57] Christof Plothe: Okay. We might just know, get to our next speaker. First of all, good luck, uh, Dr. Malone and Dr. Kory for not having too many icy roads in Hawaii. Yeah. And, um, good luck with all your next efforts. The next speakers are going to be Kim Witczak from USA, viewing COVID-19 through an advocate lens. [00:56:20] Kim Witczak is an international drug safety advocate, speak with over 25 years professional experience in advertising and marketing communications. She became involved in pharmaceutical drug safety issues after the sudden death of her husband in 2003, due to an undisclosed drug side effect of antidepressants. She was instrumental in helping to get FDA black box suicide warnings, added to antidepressants in 2004 and 2006. [00:56:50] So thank you very much for your time in joining us and I\u2019ll hand it over to you and to Zoe. [00:56:58] Kim Witczak: Good afternoon. Thank you so much for including me. It was an honor to be on the same or following Dr. Malone and seeing some of my heroes and Dr. Kory. [00:57:08] Mine is going to be a whole different type of presentation than Dr. Malone\u2019s and talking about all the science and all of that. All I know is people like you and him are really instrumental in doing my work, but so I am going to, um, you know, I first to give you a little background, I need to, um, tell you a story about how I became the accidental advocate. [00:57:32] Unfortunately I didn\u2019t know, only too well, the high price of a failed drug safety system. I never set out to do this advocacy work, but as I say, sometimes our greatest purposes choose us. This is my husband, Woody and me. It\u2019s 2003. We are happily married. We both have successful careers and started to talk about having a family. [00:57:55] However, on August 6th, 2003, while out of town on business, I got a call from my dad that changed my life forever. My husband of almost 10 years was found hanging from the rafters of our garage dead at age 37. Woody wasn\u2019t depressed nor did he have a history of depression or any other mental illness. [00:58:17] Woody had just [00:58:18] started his dream job with a startup company and was having difficulty sleeping. So he went to his family doctor and was given, um, the antidepressant Zoloft and was told that it would take the edge off and help him sleep. Five weeks later, he was dead. While I was out of town, the next thing I remember is the coroner asked if Woody was on any medication. [00:58:41] I couldn\u2019t remember the name of it, but she proceeds to tell me there\u2019s a bottle of Zoloft sitting on the kitchen counter and needed to take it with her because it might have something to do with his death. Zoloft? What would Zoloft have to do with his death? We were told it was perfectly safe. [00:58:59] Ironically, the front page of our local newspaper had an article that same day that said the UK finds link between antidepressants and suicide. From the beginning Woody\u2019s death never made any sense. Why would a guy who loved life take his own life? At this time there were no black box warnings on antidepressants. [00:59:19] So it became my mission to educate and help change the label. So immediately my brother-in-law and I got on a plane and headed to DC and met with FDA, HHS, Congress, and even helped with the energy and commerce subcommittee investigations that ultimately led to congressional hearings on antidepressants. [00:59:39] Woody\u2019s story was also featured in media, um, around the world, unlike what we\u2019re seeing today. I also had a \u201cfailure to warn wrongful death\u201d lawsuit against Pfizer and was able to get documents out from under, uh, next slide. That\u2019ll show some documents. We\u2019re able to get documents out from under seal that the, um, that the FDA, Pfizer and others have long known about the risk of suicide, but failed to tell the public. [01:00:08] So eventually we helped to get a black box suicide warning added in 2004 for kids, and 2006 for young adults. To think this was 13 years after the FDA first held hearings in 1991 on suicide and Prozac. How many lives were destroyed before the FDA finally warned about the risk of suicidality with SSRS. [01:00:34] At one of our first meetings with the head of the FDA, we asked the agency, why weren\u2019t they curious and planning to investigate, especially if somebody who wasn\u2019t depressed when on to hang himself, just as the NTSB investigates, after a plane crash, I would have thought the FDA and Pfizer would want to get to the bottom of what was going on. [01:00:54] Instead they told us we were just anecdotes. They didn\u2019t see suicide in the, um, or suicidal ideation happening in the company, clinical trials. I quickly learned they like to blame the person and the disease, not their medication. Initially, I thought this was just an isolated issue with antidepressants, but I quickly realized it was a bigger systemic problem with our nation\u2019s drug safety system. A system [01:01:22] that [01:01:22] was, that is driven by commercial interests, compounded by issues, such as lack of transparency, conflicts of interest undue industry influence with marketing and PR spins, ghostwriting manipulation of clinical trials. And then there\u2019s the politics within the role of the FDA and Congress. And truthfully the system isn\u2019t really set out to look and focus on harms. [01:01:50] No one really wants to talk about it until it\u2019s too late. So when COVID hit in 2020, and the focus quickly turned to operation warp speed, I took pause. Up to this point, vaccine safety advocacy was never my issue. However, something didn\u2019t sit right about these rushed novel one size fits all approach vaccines using the emergency use authorization to come to market. [01:02:22] In my over 18 years of drug safety, um, experience all starting with the death of my husband, which pharma likes to consider acceptable collateral damage or the cost of doing business. I have had to intimately learn how to connect the dots between the business of pharma, the regulatory legal and legislative systems. [01:02:46] I also have the unique perspective of sitting on one of the FDA advisory committees, reviewing new drugs, coming to market. In addition, as you heard in my bio, uh, I spent my entire career and I\u2019m still in advertising and marketing. My business is in the business to change consumer behavior in an effort to help drive our client\u2019s businesses. [01:03:09] So I understand the marketing and messaging machine. So here are a few of my observations in no particular order, but it\u2019s kind of viewed through this lens. Starting with, from the beginning, powerful messaging, uh, COVID equaled death, the fear of the virus, um, it\u2019s your moral obligation was stamped into human psyche. And then there was the one size fits all approach. [01:03:39] Instead of focusing on those who are sick or the most vulnerable. Since when has a one size fits all medication, um, happened like in all medicine has risks. Um, and we also, um, walked away from a key leg or component of medicine, which is informed consent. The rushed and shortened clinical trials done within months. [01:04:02] Usually they take years to do these kinds of trials and on top of it, they were unblinded and we lost the placebo control group. And the opportunity to learn in a controlled environment, which are still going on, how the efficacy works on long-term as well as crucial, uh long-term and short term safety impacts. [01:04:27] I also found it interesting that there was no discussion of early treatment or natural immunity or wanting ways to, um, help boost our immunity or to talk about the risk factors. And as we all know, some of the repurposed drugs were quickly demonized. Knowing what I know about how the FDA works, had there been drugs on the market that worked, they would not have been able to use the emergency use authorization mechanism to fast-track this product to market. [01:05:01] I see this all the time in my role, um, sitting on the FDA committee, most of the drugs that are coming before our committee are using some form of breakthrough therapy or other fast tracking mechanism, which ultimately compromises the gold standard of clinical trials. Having had a lawsuit, I found the idea that the companies using the EUA were granted complete legal immunity. [01:05:29] Like they couldn\u2019t, they couldn\u2019t be held liable for the products that they made, um, and, you know, for potential harms and deaths that were caused by their products. So the fact that they can\u2019t be sued, um, definitely raised a flag. Then, of course there\u2019s the role of media. You saw some of those earlier photos where the media actually, they helped sometimes, but you know, uh, there still were a lot of issues [01:05:54] like what we\u2019re seeing today. Where is investigative journalism? Mainstream media has quickly become an extension of the PR departments of the government and pharmaceutical companies. The mantra of \u201ccompletely safe and effective\u201d has become the mantra that we all hear non-stop bombarded by the media. [01:06:16] And then of course, you know, being a marketer, I was immediately drawn to the idea that the first round of incentives were, uh, the donuts for a day. Um, you know, every day for a year, if you show your vaccine, we have baseball tickets, we\u2019ve got, uh, come into the bar, get your shot, and then get a shot. $200 for kids. [01:06:41] In the states, we\u2019ve got a chance to win a million dollars, a lottery, and even get a full rides college scholarship. Is this really health or is it marketing? And in my world, it\u2019s marketing. And then of course you have the celebrities and influencers all doing their, you know, like on Instagram, taking their shot, saying that it is \u201ccompletely safe and effective. [01:07:06] Go out and get your shot. Do your part.\u201d Classic marketing tool. I also found the, uh, idea that there was no public debate of other perspectives, opinions, review of data. Instead people that had different opinions like Malone and a lot of the people like, uh, in this group, they\u2019re censored. They\u2019re shut down. [01:07:25] Their social media accounts are shut down. And people that are using their high social status of like celebrities and political equity, uh, come to try to drive their official, the official agenda, like what we\u2019re seeing in Spotify today. So I think that\u2019s, that is a huge problem. And I see it on the, uh, FDA. [01:07:46] I\u2019ve always said it from day one. When I look back at the antidepressants, why aren\u2019t we hearing from the people that saw the risk of suicide in the UK, Dr. Healy, and why aren\u2019t we hearing from them? And, but we only heard from the FDA and the people that they wanted to hear from. So I\u2019ve always questioned that and I will always push for debate. [01:08:04] Then of course, there\u2019s data collection. You know, there\u2019s so much data out there, but like what constituted case? How our deaths collected? Is it with COVID, of COVID? Are you unvaccinated because you got harmed a day after the vaccine, but it\u2019s not, it doesn\u2019t count for two weeks. Like the whole thing, like there\u2019s just, nobody seems to be questioning that, um, from the mainstream or even our, uh, the official narrative. [01:08:31] And then, um, of course, one thing that has driven me crazy is the changing, the moving goalposts around messaging. The messaging started out from two weeks, stay at home, to get the vaccine it\u2019ll prevent COVID and stops transmission to whoa, it\u2019s waning, but you\u2019re going to need a booster. Oh yeah. You\u2019re going to need another booster. To now everybody\u2019s going to get affected, but the jab, um, protects you from severe disease and hospitalization. [01:09:02] And so it just kept changing, so that I found and that\u2019s okay. I mean, new science changes, but then you have to be able to have conversation and have debates. And then it seems like we have a global playbook. So we are a global world as you know, as what zoom allows us to do and connect with people from all over the world. [01:09:21] And, and it seems like it\u2019s a very well orchestrated, um, playbook. Everybody\u2019s speaking off the same talking points. The same ones are being used by the leaders, uh, regulators, mainstream media, all using, um, the same similar language, the tactics of name calling and censoring different opinions. And they\u2019re all the same opinions. And \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d. [01:09:48] It seems like that is just, now everybody\u2019s like false and misleading. It\u2019s like a common, you know, you talk to anybody in the public that is not in our space and they\u2019re like, oh yeah, that\u2019s just false and misleading. It\u2019s all. So it, they have done a really good job of getting that, um, put into our, into our mindset. [01:10:03] Um, but you know, they shut down social media, PR campaigns, um, mainstream media silencing everyone that goes against the official narrative. And as you know, um, Dr. Malone said, you know, even listening to some of the highly conflicted Reuters, um, fact checkers, you know, just understanding that system and who\u2019s behind the money behind it. [01:10:25] As my husband always said, follow the money and you will always get your answers. And then of course there\u2019s the lack of transparency, access to data, and the open public FDA hearings, um, for these big decisions around the children\u2019s authorizations and boosters. You know, I\u2019ve been involved in FDA. I spoke before all the FDA advisory committees since last December and I was shocked. [01:10:49] But not. But they promised us that we would have open and transparent, um, transparent process, but we didn\u2019t when it came to kids and boosters. So, and then obviously the access to the data, we all know what\u2019s happening. Um, with, you know, it\u2019s going to be 75 years and now the lawsuits are saying it\u2019ll probably be within this year, but now the FDA is asking Pfizer to get involved, to help them with the large volumes of data that needs to be retracted. [01:11:18] So that raises a flag. This is probably the one that is most, um, close to my heart because, um, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve experienced. And that is the gaslighting of those who have been vaccine injured and the deaths. They did their part that the government asks them to do, but, and they were injured and now they\u2019re left on the battlefield and they\u2019re on their own. [01:11:44] There has been no interest from the government officials or the mainstream medical establishment to consider injuries or the link of injuries to the vaccines. No acknowledgement or help. Instead, the harms are vilified by the media and the injured are called anti-vaxxers. Just like we were called Scientologists back in the day with antidepressants. They\u2019re silenced and discredited. [01:12:11] It\u2019s all in their head. They all have an agenda. I mean, it\u2019s really beyond, um, inhumane. And I have personally, um, worked with and have gotten to know some of my friends that run reactnineteen.org who experienced this every single day and they are my heroes. And then of course the VAERS system, we all know the VAERS system is not perfect. [01:12:38] But I\u2019ve always said that MedWatch or the VAERS system should serve as a signal and we need our regulators to be interrogating the data and reports of harm. I\u2019ve long advocated for an independent safety review and monitoring board. The people who approve the products should not be the same people who are responsible for monitoring safety. [01:13:02] The FAA does not investigate plane crashes. The NTSB does. The world of drug and vaccine safety needs its own NTSB. And that\u2019s something that I know that we\u2019re going to be pushing for in Congress. And then finally, I must, um, touch on the idea of mandates that are affecting all of our lives. This is not a red or blue issue. [01:13:25] It\u2019s a human rights issue. I say, where there\u2019s risk, there must also be choice. There\u2019s a dark irony in the era of patient-centered care and shared decision-making. Neither patient-centered care nor shared decision-making are even present in the conversations around mandates. People should not have to be coerced or forced to choose between freedom to bodily autonomy or their livelihood. Public health, maybe population based approach. [01:13:59] But we need to remember that we\u2019re still treating individuals and a one size fits all does not work. In closing, critical thinking and ability to have conversations with differing opinions is a must. So I want to leave you with one of my favorite quotes by Albert Einstein. Um, and that is \u201cI have no special talents. [01:14:22] I\u2019m just passionately curious.\u201d I believe that being curious is essential to problem solving and learning. When we opened the door to increasing our knowledge and understanding, we grow in innovation and creativity. The issues that we\u2019re discussing are not black and white, rather they\u2019re both, and shades of gray. [01:14:43] The pandemic has been, uh, politicized and has created such division in our society and personal lives. Families being torn apart. And I want it to be our collective goal to like bring back hope, um, empathy, the ability to have conversations, to have human connections again. So thank you for, um, allowing me to have this opportunity to, uh, address this amazing group. [01:15:13] I look forward to working together because I think it takes all of us in all of our roles and positions. And unfortunately some of us have to be victims, and I hate that word victim, but it\u2019s the ones that had to live with the consequences. And so thank you for all you guys that are out there fighting for us. [01:15:32] And also standing up for the injured and acknowledging them because we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, but, and I also have to say, um, what we heard about the trucker\u2019s amazing, amazing. Thank you. [01:15:43] Christof Plothe: Well, thank you very much, Kim. Thank you very much for the very moving presentation and for your determination, courage and persistence on these issues. [01:15:52] And, um, yeah, we\u2019ll have to ask ourself what the accepted collateral damage with this rollout will be, um, observing that the 40% rise in overall mortality last month has climbed to over up to 140%. You know what it means when your so-called accepted collateral damage, um, what a term and absolutely we need some independent safety monitoring. [01:16:17] And I think there will be lots of questions that are handed over to Kat to do that. Thank you. [01:16:25] Dr. Kat Lindley: I just want to share a comment that someone made. They said it\u2019s a very inspiring that you took your belief and turned it into a voice of advocacy and truth. And the work that you\u2019re doing for all of us is amazing. [01:16:35] And we\u2019re very grateful. I have one question for you from, uh, Shabnam. The question is, have you ever experienced big pharma pressure because of your committed advocacy? [01:16:47] Kim Witczak: Oh, absolutely. Um, I think back to when I had just even my lawsuit, I saw the tactics that they did. They went to neighbors. Pfizer had me for nine hours for my, um, interrogation and the first half of it, all they want to know is who knew what in DC. [01:17:04] And finally I looked at him. Yeah, This is not a go, you are not asking anything about my husband being dead. And then finally they asked a question, so I know their tactics that they did, and they wanted to know how did I meet Senator Grassley. They wanted to get into my nitty gritty. They wanted to know about where I got the documents, but I took those documents. [01:17:22] As soon as my lawyers that were amazing, got them out. I took them out because it was not my story. It was in black and white, their letterhead, not mine. And I just, and there were, you know, thousands of people that have been impacted by the antidepressants. And then as recent as, you know, I sit on the FDA advisory committee and, um, and we were reviewing and I\u2019m not sure how many people know the story or the backstory behind Chantix, which is the, um, anti-smoking, um, or smoking cessation drug. [01:17:53] Well, Pfizer, um, after they settled all the lawsuits and shut up every one of the victims, they came to the FDA to remove, to get the black box warning removed. That was on the drug. And, um, so I was excited because I was now sitting on the committee and I was excited to ask, but, um, a couple of days, um, cause I wanted to know where the victims were. [01:18:12] I wanted to know why all of a sudden now are we removing the black box warning when there\u2019s all these people and they settled for millions of dollars. Why couldn\u2019t we hear from them? A couple of days before I went to the FDA and said that, um, and got me basically kicked off the advisory committee and I was not able to go because I had an intellectual bias and I remember challenging them saying, an intellectual bias, if I have an intellectual bias and we all do, and I will, I said an intellectual bias, [01:18:41] I will always have safety first. And if that\u2019s an intellectual bias, you don\u2019t want me on the FDA committee because that is where I will always come from. I will also always, if I\u2019m wrong, I will admit that I\u2019m wrong or I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not so married into my point of view. So yes I have had pressure. But I also know. [01:19:00] Um, I also know that I already lost the most important thing in my life, and I know what this means. I don\u2019t want other people to have the same fate that I do. So that at the end of the day has been my driving mission and I will continue to do it. And, you know, pharma\u2019s pharma, as a business. [01:19:20] Dr. Kat Lindley: Well, thank you very much for everything that you do for us, for someone who does a lot of advocacy, takes great commitment, and we appreciate everything you do. When you get a chance, please look at the chat. There\u2019s lots of great comments there for you. And, uh, please let us know, uh, how to get in touch with you again, so that all our partners can get in touch with you if they have questions. [01:19:40] Kim Witczak: Hey, I was [01:19:42] going to say, I think it\u2019s on the last slide too, but, um, [email protected], um, or KimWitczak.com is my other website as well. So, uh, thank you so much, um, for allowing me this opportunity. [01:19:59] Christof Plothe: Thank you very much, Kim. I\u2019d like to proceed with our program for tonight, uh, by introducing our coalition partners. [01:20:08] I Would like to introduce, uh, Ria Heslop-Hayes and Danee Dixon from the UK. Their title is No More Silence. Ria is the founder of the international organization, No More Silence, and will be joined by Danee Dixon. Who\u2019s one the many people around the world who have experienced side effects of the vaccines. [01:20:27] And for that, [01:20:28] the question and answers, [01:20:29] I will hand over to Shabnam Palesa Mohamed. [01:20:32] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you very much, Christoph and a very warm welcome to and I need to let them leave the world council for. Health Yeah, I believe we starting with, you\u2019re talking about the organization. No more silence quite to profound name. [01:20:48] Indeed. So let\u2019s start here. What led to you starting no more silence. [01:20:55] Ria Heslop-Hayes: This is actually quite difficult for me to talk about because, um, my father was one of the first in the UK who actually died of Pfizer vaccine. So that was a year ago. Went in to hospital in, uh, [inaudible] in the United Kingdom, um, and what we experienced when he went in was horrific. [01:21:18] I noticed very quickly there was just so much cover up and lies. Um, in fact, it\u2019s so bad that I actually put the recorder on my phone and recorded, um, all the events that were happening. Um, let\u2019s see, uh, hospital with Pfizer, um, much more, um, going forward. Um, sadly he died and the measures that the hospital went through to cover up was utterly criminal. [01:21:56] And then since my father\u2019s death, um, I was contacted by so, so many people, um, locally and otherwise, and his horrific journey really led me to realize that there was just such a coverup. Um, and I had to go forward, and ensure that other people could tell their stories. So what initially happened. I was so distraught. [01:22:31] Initially I did a live video on Facebook about the death of my father from Pfizer and the events that took place at the hospital. And I uploaded that together with the voice recordings and it went viral. And then my inbox just flooded from hundreds of vaccine victims from everywhere, all over the world. [01:22:54] Sadly each week passed, the numbers grew and grew. Um, I thought that I could go to the press, um, because it was such a horrific story. I thought well they\u2019re just going to want, going to interview me. Um, and in fact they did, um, I think it\u2019s three journalists and a couple of truth journalists. Actually did interview me and I just thought the story would be like that. [01:23:24] It was, it was new. Um, it\u2019s an adverse reaction. It\u2019s a death. It was a dreadful experience at the hospital, but the story never got published. Um, and then when speaking to other victims, that was exactly the same, every story they would just be embarrassed. There was, there was no where to go. There was just nowhere to go. [01:23:48] There was nobody. There was no effort to hear our voices. So from that, I knew that I just couldn\u2019t let my father\u2019s story and other people sit there. We\u2019re never going to be covered by mainstream media but I wanted to set up initially a safe platform where our stories and voices were heard and over many months, um, we ended up initially launching the website No More Silence. [01:24:21] And that still goes today. And I\u2019m in contact with many victims and that is sadly through loss from the vaccines, all of the different vaccines and, um, some adverse reaction. Um, so that\u2019s, that\u2019s, that\u2019s how No More Silence the website the victim side of it, was, came about. [01:24:46] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: I want to thank you for sharing your experience, and both you and Danee, uh, as well as victims and survivors around the world, certainly have love and solidarity from the World Council for Health. Can you share with us, what are the key activities of No more Silence? [01:25:04] Ria Heslop-Hayes: Well initially it was launched as I say, as a safe platform for victims to tell their stories. [01:25:11] Although over the last year, it\u2019s also a year that\u2019s passed since my father has died, it\u2019s now just escalated. And it\u2019s, there\u2019s just so many different areas to No More Silence. Um, so we have systems, we have lots of different people now involved, um, all voluntary. Um, we have systems that work on the website and the platform, um, that allows victims to tell their stories. [01:25:39] We only actually platform two to three stories a day, although sadly we have hundreds of emails. We also work with lots of other injury groups, um, around the world, um, on different projects and awareness. Um, we have volunteers looking after social media, um, we now work with doctors worldwide on treatment protocols for the injured, and let\u2019s see, that\u2019s still evolving. [01:26:07] We, um, have a team of volunteer counselors, which is very, very important. That\u2019s worldwide. So they\u2019re all voluntary. Um, that is for the injured because of the trauma they\u2019ve been through. And, um, the people that lost loved ones to the vaccine. Um, we have advisors presently working, um, with the vaccine injured who have had first vaccine trying to get, um, medical exemptions in the UK and we also, um, have advisors to, uh, everybody really including NHS workers in regards to exemptions. A key point, um, as well, [01:26:53] um, I work closely with a lawyer in the UK called Peter Todd and he\u2019s been a vaccine injury lawyer for about 20 years. And, um, he helps people navigate through the vaccine injured, um, compensation scheme. Um, and we are presently just in the process of, um, working on the class action for AstraZeneca. [01:27:21] So we have actually started that. And, um, I think it was about 4th of January, um, in the background we\u2019ve been doing that, but we\u2019re ready to, um, go ahead and go forward with that. Um, then I worked closely with [one chapel geo], um, he\u2019s kind of a buffer and, um, because I have so many people contact me and he works with the statisticians, the injury groups, collating data much more. [01:27:54] And then of course, when I\u2019m working with wonderful people like yourselves to, to promote awareness, actual science and truth. So what started out as what I thought was going to be somewhere to tell our stories has grown into something huge. [01:28:18] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you for that Ria. I\u2019ve got another question for you regarding your website. On your website, you mentioned experiencing censorship. Can you tell us more about that? And some of the other challenges that No More Silence has faced? [01:28:32] Ria Heslop-Hayes: Um, yeah, I mean, this is something that is, I just can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened to be fair. [01:28:43] Um, it\u2019s not just our website. Um, and this is huge. So I initially in the beginning, even before No More Silence, um, website, um, was launched. I started a Facebook page, um, and it was No More Silence Facebook page, so it was just a personal page. And I think it was a way for me to, it was telling other people\u2019s stories, but it was probably a way for me to process what was happening, what happened with my father. [01:29:19] Anyway, that grew, had 120,000 followers on that. Um, and I get banned on, uh, well, I\u2019m always banned. So on that side, on social media, um, the censorship is ridiculous. We then recently set up a new group, which was a Facebook No More Silence Facebook page. And I think it\u2019s only been going a couple of months with 11 or 12 thousand, um, members on that, and that is continually warned. [01:29:53] And I believe now it\u2019s shadow banned. Um, we then thought that we\u2019d move over to telegram and again, that\u2019s, that\u2019s not been going very long. Um, but the very first I thought that was a safe platform, but the very first day that we started that, we had a warning, um, that we would be de-platformed. Um, then our website now I\u2019m not very, um, website techno. [01:30:29] So, um, I\u2019ll read this actually. Um, so I\u2019m told by systems that, uh, we receive a multitude of daily DDoS attacks and attempts to hijack our domain data. We presently, presently now, this moment and over the last few weeks, um, we\u2019ve got an unknown source, diverting traffic to an alternative IP address. Um, despite us having very high level security in place, we\u2019ve actually got somebody, um, writing back all of our data from our website to, um, an IP address. [01:31:12] Um, it\u2019s happened before. We have had what seems to be our website taken over by somebody taken down. Um, so everywhere is, there\u2019s just huge censorship. Um, and also what\u2019s very sad. Um, I\u2019ve got an autistic sister and, um, I don\u2019t know how this happened or how significant this was, but, um, everybody that seems to be in contact with me, um, on Facebook has been de-platform and my sister who had her Facebook page for 15 years. [01:32:02] Um, and it\u2019s kind of everything to her all the photos of my father and absolutely everything. On the day of, um, the anniversary of his death, which was the 31st of January. Facebook, without warning deleted her Facebook account, completely and wiped everything that she had. So I don\u2019t know how that happens, but it\u2019s just the censorship. [01:32:38] It\u2019s disgusting. We can\u2019t get our stories out there. If anybody shares anything from No More Silence, cause we have a, so on our website, we have a share option to many different platforms, but if people share, um, from No More Silence, um, to their Facebook pages or Twitter, they\u2019re banned, they\u2019re taken down, so the censorship is horrendous. [01:33:06] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: I\u2019m just really in awe of your courage and your compassion and I am certain that your dad looks upon you with immense, immense pride. [01:33:16] Ria Heslop-Hayes: He does. He guides, he definitely guides this. He gives me strength. Without, I don\u2019t know, you know, I don\u2019t know how I, obviously, I never wanted to go into this. I didn\u2019t choose to go into this, but I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t stop this until this stops because how can I, I\u2019ve got to, you know, my dad was such a beautiful person and I\u2019ve just got to, [01:33:45] I\u2019ve got [01:33:46] to speak his truth and I\u2019ve got to support and try to get everybody to, you know, be allowed to speak theirs, but how do you do that? How can we do that when every junction of the way, we\u2019re just stopped? [01:34:02] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Well, by working together, we certainly so much stronger and so much more united. [01:34:07] So we\u2019ve very glad to welcome [01:34:08] you at the World Council [01:34:09] for Health. [01:34:10] Ria Heslop-Hayes: Thank you for having me. [01:34:12] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: So welcome. Can you share with us, what is your vision for No More Silence going forward into the future? [01:34:20] Ria Heslop-Hayes: Well I think going forward, it\u2019s unknown really. Um, as we all know the goal posts, they just, they move everyday [01:34:28] don\u2019t they. But we\u2019ll continue with the work we\u2019re presently doing. Um, we\u2019ll grow our team to cope with the volume of work, to support the victims, the injured, anybody really. We\u2019ve got to try and stop this. We\u2019ve got to try and stop the forced jabs, the mandates, the tyranny. [01:34:45] So as you say, by working together, we\u2019ve just, we\u2019ve got to get change and I\u2019m hoping that No More Silence could be a part of that. [01:35:00] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: No More Silence absolutely. What have you learned that might be helpful to others setting up their own projects to try and help people during this pandemic? [01:35:11] Ria Heslop-Hayes: Well, I neverthought honestly that I\u2019d be here today. [01:35:14] Um, I was taken on this journey due to the tragic circumstances that we\u2019ve just discussed. Um, obviously it\u2019s been a really, really steep learning curve. So I would say if you\u2019re going to do anything that goes against the narrative, you must realize that, um, this will put you in a place that\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not comfortable. [01:35:39] As we already know, all of us will be vilified. Sadly, you\u2019ll lose friends and family, um, that are on the opposite side. Um, although I\u2019m very Switzerland actually I\u2019m in the middle. I try to see everybody\u2019s side. But, um, and obviously you\u2019re going to be censored much more. Um, your time will be consumed by your project or calls. [01:36:08] So you do need to, I don\u2019t do it, but you do need to try and find time for yourself outside of your calls. Um, one thing I believe is to question everything and everybody, I don\u2019t mean that in a, a bitter way. Um, but you do need to question people and really, really follow your intuition. Um, going back to mainstream media and journalists, et cetera. [01:36:42] When you go through a trauma and you want to tell your story, um, and then by doing that, and then by sharing that, um, and then nobody doing anything with it. Um, what I\u2019m trying to say here is really think carefully about who you share things with, get to know people, um, and get to trust people, um, and surround yourself with like-minded people. [01:37:14] And let [01:37:15] them guide you until you\u2019re ready to go solo. So use, you know, use people, um, in a positive way until you\u2019re able to do the same and pass forward. Um, but if you don\u2019t look after yourself, then you\u2019re not going to be able to fight your cause or the causes that you\u2019re trying to help. [01:37:40] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: A network work is the best [inaudible] as expected. But one last question for you Ria. I think what you could share with us that would be so valuable given the kind of work that you\u2019re doing with such immense courage, what do you do to stay positive every day? [01:38:00] Ria Heslop-Hayes: I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not positive every day, um, because this journey has been incredibly painful. [01:38:07] Um, I speak to so many injured and it\u2019s utterly heartbreaking, but I have to say, this tragedy, um, I\u2019ve made so many friends, um, the victims, like-minded people, doctors, from people from all walks of life, friendships that are really deep, meaningful. And for that I\u2019m grateful. Knowing that on a daily basis, it helps the many. That in itself touches my heart. [01:38:38] Um, so that gives me positivity. Um, and again, being involved with like-minded people like yourselves, um, involved in the pushback gives me hope that we can change this. So although it\u2019s difficult to say positive, um, we have to, we have to, to fight this and we have to get through this. [01:39:03] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Inspiring words [01:39:03] indeed. Hope springs eternal, and courage is contagious. Ria, thank you so much for sharing your life story and your work with No More Silence. And we look forward to working with you together. [01:39:18] And from Ria, we\u2019re going to be having a conversation with Danee Dixon, also another very brave and courageous and inspiring human being. Uh, Danny, if you can hear me right now and you\u2019re ready for this conversation, first of all thank you for making the time to do this. I know it\u2019s not easy, but when you speak out to give others the courage to do so as well. So perhaps let\u2019s start here. [01:39:44] What made you decide to take the COVID-19 injections? [01:39:49] Danee Dixon: Well I chose to get the COVID-19 vaccine, despite my better judgment. Um, but I was a respiratory therapist working in the COVID ICU. Um, and you know, at that time it was very intimidating. Um, not really having that ability of hindsight, knowing that I was seeing, you know, the worst of the worst w within my facility. [01:40:14] You know, I was a little bit afraid of what I was seeing. Um, more so I was afraid of bringing it home to my mom. She had the, the main comorbidities of, you know, what COVID was attacking at that moment. And, uh, I was also afraid because I was within my 90 days, uh, uh, my dream job at my dream hospital. [01:40:34] And, they were very much encouraging it. And I was very worried that if I showed resistance at that moment and didn\u2019t get it, that I wouldn\u2019t be brought on full time. So, uh, you know, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t want it, but I thought I was doing my best for others. And, and, um, I thought I was doing what was expected of me. [01:40:58] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: And you\u2019re certainly not alone. Here at the World Council for Health, again, love and solidarity to you and to all victims and survivors, wherever you might be, you are not alone. [01:41:08] Danee Dixon: I appreciate that. [01:41:10] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: You\u2019re most welcome. What can [01:41:11] you tell us about the batch that you took? Around the world there\u2019s not enough information about batches and the distances in toxicity and adverse reactions, but you may have some information on the batch that you took. What can you share with us? [01:41:26] Danee Dixon: The batch I took was Pfizer, the first one in December of 2020. Lot number EH 9 8 9 9, which, um, had 2052 adverse reactions, 21 deaths, 39 disabilities, uh, in 25 life threatening illnesses. [01:41:44] Um, my second dose was Pfizer as well in January, 2021, uh, EL 1 2 8 3, uh, which was highlighted as one of the most toxic doses. 2249 adverse reactions, 50 deaths, 36 disabilities and 45 life threatening illnesses. Um, I mean, I don\u2019t know the science all behind it. I just know the effects and what I\u2019ve been able to look at as far as, you know, my, my, my batches. [01:42:16] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: It certainly is, um, you know, signal to the rest of us around the world, especially those that are considering taking the injection, [01:42:23] uh, to have a look at what information is coming out in terms of these batches. Danee, what health issues did you experience as a result of taking this injection whether a physical or cognitive? Anything you\u2019re comfortable sharing us. [01:42:37] Danee Dixon: Yeah. Do you mind, I\u2019m going to have to read a little bit, cause I don\u2019t want to forget, forget anything. [01:42:41] Um, as a result of taking this vaccine, my life has changed dramatically. After my first dose December. I had yet to have a menstrual cycle in over a year. [01:42:59] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Take your time Danee. We\u2019re here with [01:43:09] Danee Dixon: 12 hours after my second injection I had a horrible headache, flu like symptoms, um, the headache, and, um, that still remains today. Um, I had brain fog, headaches and swollen lymph nodes throughout February. March continued headaches and ER, visit for upper GI issues. April was worsening headaches. May brought me tremors in my hands and another ER, visit for headaches. [01:43:41] June introduced me to stuttering and difficulty speaking, dizziness and difficulty walking. [01:43:51] July brought me issues with gripping items with my hands, such as simple as a glass. August brought me facial twitches and a head jerk. September brought me hot flashes and irregular heartbeat. October gave me another ER visit. I was also gifted with uncontrollable spasms and tremors in my legs. So bad that I had fallen and broken my foot, which required wearing cast. November was the month filled with increasing tremors spasms with uncon-, um, controllable headaches. [01:44:23] And we finished off the year in December with pain in my hands and feet. And now what do all of those symptoms equate to? [01:44:33] MRIs? CTS, lumbar punctures, blood tests, TCDs, EEGs, ultrasounds on my carotid artery, an MRA, MRB, EMG, CNS, ultrasound on my thyroid with results such as diffuse brain dysfunction, inflammation in my brain, elevated D dimer inflammation to my thyroid, chronic Epstein-Barr virus, Polyneuropathy. All things that I didn\u2019t have prior. [01:45:05] So yeah, that\u2019s where, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. [01:45:08] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: We believe you, Danny, and we love you for your courage. Thank you so much. You speaking out gives others the courage to stand up and speak out as well. Can I ask, how is your medical journey been since you had the adverse reaction to now and how have you been treated by the medical community? [01:45:29] Danee Dixon: I didn\u2019t even start getting help until September, um, every time I went to, I mean, me working as a respiratory therapist, going to, um, my own facilities. I was told that I had anxiety or I was told that I had migraines and no one took me seriously. They made me feel like I was crazy. Um, you know, uh, migraines don\u2019t happen, you know, 24 hours a day for, you know, 300 and what thirty seven, three hundred and thirty six days now. [01:46:05] Um, I, um, I have a hard time finding treatment. You know, um, if it wasn\u2019t for No More Silence reaching out and getting me, you know, in contact with certain places or what to look for, I have tried everything under the sun and then continued to, um, and it\u2019s just been really heartbreaking to know that my community, um, my community has shunned me or, you know, they, they, uh, they don\u2019t listen. [01:46:39] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Well we\u2019re here and we are listening and the tide will turn the more survivors speak out. Danny, what message would you give to others in your situation, whether in your country or any of where on the planet that we call home? [01:46:53] Danee Dixon: The advice I would give is just hold your stance, you know, take notes of everything, [01:46:57] thing that your feeling and get involved with group groups and, and see what kind of testing and treat treatments everyone is doing. Um, may make sure that you let your doctors believe you, you know, uh, and if they don\u2019t, you need to find someone that will. I mean, this is your, your health health. I wish I could say that there was a specific treatment plan that, you know, was working for me. [01:47:19] God knows I\u2019m trying everything, some that are so far-fetched I\u2019ve done detox baths and, and drank every tea and ate every root I can possibly. Um, but I\u2019ve had 23 days without a headache in 386 days total. And, um, I\u2019m talking about days that are 24 hours a day. Um, so you know, things such as, um, IVI, plasmapheresis, NAD, I I\u2019m doing hyperopic [inaudible] now. Um, you know, all of these things have given me brief moments of, um, of breaks, but, but nothing that has brought me back to be able to go and, and be me again. [01:48:00] Um, but you know, I just, I just tell people, you have to take notes of everything and just fight and speak up. I mean, I\u2019ve had my pages shut down. I\u2019ve been bullied and death threats. I\u2019ve had people announce where I live my phone numbers, everything and trying to shut, shut me up. And, um, you know, it\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s scarier thinking that they\u2019re going to force this on other people. [01:48:27] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: And here we are speaking out and standing our ground. Danee, what do you do to stay so positive, and so, I would say, resilient every day? [01:48:39] Danee Dixon: I\u2019m not positive everyday. I feel robbed every day. Um, I hurt. I\u2019m in pain every day, but I\u2019m hopeful that I live in a world where, um, this type of torture cannot be continued and forced upon us and our children. [01:48:55] I continue to fight and seek treatment because I want to help people because that is the core of who I am. Um, but there\u2019s a lesson to be learned in this. And I\u2019m not really sure what it is, but, uh, I\u2019m determined to figure it out. [01:49:14] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: We will figure it out together, Danee. Thank you so much for joining us today for sharing your story, but also being so committed to helping others who may be in a similar situation wherever they may be from. You are so welcomed at the world council for health. [01:49:28] And if you have a look at the comment section for both of you and Ria, the number of times people have said thank you. And thank you for being a hero and you are loved. That we mean from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you very much once again for joining us. [01:49:43] Danee Dixon: And I would just like to say, there\u2019s someone watching that you know, is in the medical field that has seen somebody get better or knows of something that can help. [01:49:53] Um, you know, insurance doesn\u2019t cover any of this. I have spent everything trying to do this, but I\u2019m, I want to try everything. So if anyone that is a doc doctor can do something, please reach out and, um, and help me. [01:50:09] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: I think advice is already coming through from people Jessica Rose. You\u2019ll see it in the comment section. [01:50:16] And others that want to help you. Human nature is kind and compassionate and caring, Danee, and you are held in that light, and we shall continue to stand together with you and all victims and survivors around the world. Thank you so much for your courage. [01:50:31] Danee Dixon: Thank you so much. [01:50:35] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: All right. With that being done, I think a very meaningful and powerful conversation with, uh, both Ria Heslop-Hayes as well as Danee Dixon [01:50:44] from [01:50:45] No More Silence and again, love and solidarity from the world council for health. With that back to you Christof. [01:50:53] Christof Plothe: Well, I actually never wanted to be a news presentate presenter who switches from one moving subject to the next one. But yeah, here we go, because we have this meeting scheduled. Well thank you very much [01:51:05] Ria and Danee. Um, our [01:51:07] gratitude as humanity, and it\u2019s a very important to bring, um, uh, your voices out because sheer numbers don\u2019t express what you have experienced. So our gratitude, um, for what you\u2019re doing. I just saw Jennifer raising her hand. Do you want to say something? [01:51:28] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you so much for letting me speak. I just wanted to say Danee, would you please put your contact information in the chat? Because we have a lot of doctors and scientists on this call right now, and I know everybody wants to help however they can. Thank you. [01:51:44] Christof Plothe: Thank you, Jennifer. [01:51:46] Okay. Shall we move on with the next one from India? Yeah. Zoe, would you like to share a video about that? [01:51:53] Zoe Strickland: Yes, absolutely. Bear with me one moment. I\u2019ll just get it up. [01:51:58] Morning. Namaste, everyone watching this from this beautiful park and sunrise here in Bangshankri in Bangalore. Is on a Hilltop and lots of walkers around not wearing any mask. I made several people aware of not taking any further vaccines and consoled them that even if they have taken vaccine there\u2019s 95% chance that it was a placebo. [01:52:33] And for some of the ladies, like I met a pregnant women and the husband was very proudly flaunting that she is double-dose protected. I simply didn\u2019t know what, how to react to it. Now, if we want to stop said situation from some heinous inhuman situation building up that will lead to poisoning and death of millions of people in the world where the vaccine mandate still exists, where people have not summoned the courage to drop their government and to make them bend and crawl like they are doing in Britain, in parts of Europe. [01:53:17] In Africa, for example, there\u2019s just 1% vaccination rate. That\u2019s so amazing for a continent. I think the tipping points have already happened. The first tipping point was Robert Malone\u2019s interview with Joe Rogan, which is 11 million very committed viewers who like listening to the truth. Then was the Medallia\u2019s dismayed interview with Chris Martenson. [01:53:47] The formation of world council for health by Dr. Tess Laurie, Dr. Mark Trozzi and others who I had the good fortune to interact at their Monday meeting of their general assembly, uh, last, uh, Monday on 24th of January, where I made this point and Reiner Fuellmich was there and he was talking about, uh, you know, how there is lots of hope from India. [01:54:17] And I corrected him that we are not entirely, uh, depending on the codes to deliver justice. Uh, we are very certain that we can change the narrative. By what I believe is, uh, to be resolving the indigenous paradox. There\u2019s a deeper simplicity is that the indigenous is the essence of being truly human. [01:54:41] And if you don\u2019t call yourself indigenous or don\u2019t practice the indigenous way of life, you\u2019re actually not human. You are inhuman. And this inhumane-ness is what lends itself to the vision of transhumanism to the ideology of technocracy, and to the grand alibi, what I call the interstellar alibi, of trying to save human species from extinction by avoiding the climate and ecological catastrophe. [01:55:17] Thank you so much. I leave on this note for you to figure out that how this mass murder mystery should be resolved. Thank you. [01:55:26] Christof Plothe: Well, thank you very much, Zoe. That put the whole perspective a little bit away from the medical perspective, but into other issues that society will face very, very soon, but some encouraging words from India as well, which could lift us up a little bit before we moved to Canada. [01:55:47] Um, uh, we would like to say a little word about our co fighter Iris Cole, uh, from Singapore. [01:55:54] Uh, and I will read out a message in the light of the Chinese new year, which starts tomorrow. Recently, one of our own Singapore, Iris Cole, is spending her Chinese new year behind bars as it were. So this greeting is sent out to you all with a heavy heart, but also to invite you to remember our dear sister in arms and under incarceration for daring to defy the unjust powers that be in her home country. [01:56:22] So that during this time, perhaps you have the simple dignity, joy, and sheer luck to be able to enjoy a family dinner tonight, may say a prayer for her, compose a message for her online, or if you\u2019re in a position to do more than please do so, to help ones like Iris and others like her and us to change what desperately needs changing for the better. [01:56:45] So that the next Chinese new year, no matter what our race, culture, or creed, we might all have a proper reunion as if it were under freer skies, a brighter sun and a safer world for which we indeed humbly share in as one family. Happy reunion, dinner and Chinese year. Well, I hope this message will reach many and will reach, um, Iris as well to give her some courage. [01:57:16] Um, and for her to know that she\u2019s not alone. [01:57:21] Um, and Jennifer, did you have any news from Canada? [01:57:28] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: I\u2019m happy to talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in Canada. I did have some people on the ground, but I\u2019m having trouble getting through to them. And I think it\u2019s a little bit noisy there. Uh, the truckers have all, um, come into Ottawa and those that couldn\u2019t get in there, they did close the borders and try to close, uh, I think, and I\u2019m talking about the borders between the provinces. [01:57:49] Uh, so they limited the truckers that could come in. So they have done, uh, they\u2019ve got, uh, convoys going through different towns and cities and the people coming out in the thousands to support them. And in Ottawa, however, in Ottawa, uh, I understand that the government has already given them authorization. [01:58:09] To take a defensive maneuvers against the crowds, if necessary. However, the crowds are very peaceful in spite of what the mainstream media might be trying to portray. Uh, they\u2019re very peace-loving and, uh, interacting very nicely. They\u2019ve got speakers there. However, they\u2019re having trouble even getting the speakers onto a platform. [01:58:31] They had the platform taken apart. Uh, they had the in front of the parliament buildings, uh, all closed off and had, are not allowing them in there. So they\u2019re slowly kind of pushing things laterally. However, the truckers are staying tight and they are still there. So, you know, go Canada. So it is inspiring, unbelievable response all around the world. [01:58:55] I think the first day of this convoy, we were hearing that it was happening in Brazil, in Mexico, uh, in Finland and, uh, in Australia, they were doing it again at their second convoy and, you know, get it right the second time around. They\u2019re watching what Canada\u2019s doing because they did have a convoy that they did in October, but like the Australian ones they learned from that and they organized it really well. [01:59:23] And people have been coming in convoys and cars coming in from all over Canada and people are cheering them on every bridge through every city. It\u2019s really beautiful to watch everyone come together. And this is the grassroots movement that we have all been waiting for around the world. So we pray that they have success, they get their message across and we see this happening across the world and in unity. Thank you. [01:59:51] Christof Plothe: Well, thanks Jennifer for this, um, um, uplifting and encouraging updates. Um, uh, just to let you know, here in Germany, there\u2019s no mentioning of the truckers at all. There was apparently one where they said, uh, they talked about not icy roads, not icy, slippery Canada, as Pierre mentioned, but the fact that, um, there were a hundred trucks stuck in a traffic jam. [02:00:17] So that\u2019s about it we hear in mainstream news, but to hear that it\u2019s happening, not just in Canada, but there is this, this candle might spark a flame, uh, and soon more, um, all over the world. And, uh, hearing that, um, the same is going on in many parts of this, uh, of our planet is, is really encouraging. [02:00:40] And yes, I, uh, we all hope that it\u2019s the beginning of a grassroots moment movement. We have been waiting, uh, the whole time. [02:00:47] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: In North America, we understand, we were told at one point there was 40,000 truckers heading to the borders of Canada and they\u2019ve in some border areas, they\u2019ve blocked the borders and, you know, it\u2019s going to create some upset, however it needs to get attention. [02:01:04] So this is what they\u2019re doing. [02:01:06] Christof Plothe: Well, I\u2019ll hope we will have enough, um, uh, still existing media outlets. And I was surprised that a telegram could be censored in order to bring out all these pictures from all of the globe. So let\u2019s, let\u2019s park it. Yeah. Thank you. [02:01:22] Um, uh, and just to conclude this meeting, because it has been a rather long one, um, are there any urgent matters that, um, uh, need to be discussed at the moment? [02:01:35] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you Christof. Dr. Mel Bruchet and Dr. Daniel Nagase are with us and they would like a few minutes to speak, please. [02:01:41] Dr. Daniel Nagase: Allow. There we go. There we go. We\u2019re online. So, uh, yes. Hello. So, um, I just actually just had some news just regarding Ottawa and the truckers rally in Ottawa. One of the telegram chats I\u2019m a part of, um, had, uh, a photo and a short video of the RCMP. That\u2019s our federal police here in Canada, uh, sending their emergency response team of specially trained, [02:02:09] well I guess, agents and they went to 11 Metcalf street in downtown Ottawa. So I don\u2019t know where that is in relation to you Jennifer Hibbard. But if we can catch these, um, special forces, uh, federal agents on camera, then it\u2019s less likely they can, um, do, uh, bad things to, to people who are fighting for freedom. [02:02:34] Um, and you know, I also wanted to mention how similar Iris Cole\u2019s, uh, situation is in Singapore, where she is being imprisoned in a psychiatric facility. Um, in my view, I think that\u2019s an attempt to discredit, uh, the movement that she\u2019s been doing in terms of advocating for freedom and rational thought to the vaccines and this Corona virus pandemic. [02:02:59] But I\u2019ll leave it up to Dr. Mel Bruchet because he\u2019s had a 25 day forced confinement in a psychiatric facility, and he can tell you all about how speaking up and speaking out about stillbirth and vaccine side effects can, can get the authorities, uh, the federal police knocking on your door and forcing you into a psychiatric hospital now. [02:03:24] So it\u2019s your story to tell them Mel. What did they do to you while you were in hospital? [02:03:28] Dr. Mel Bruchet: Well, uh, it bears ,uh, witness to the same tale that is happening in Singapore and is happening, uh, in Canada and globally where, uh, I don\u2019t think Canadians have ever thought of themselves as living in a police state, but it certainly was in my circumstance when, uh, up to seven RCMP forcibly, put me in handcuffs and, uh, marched me up. [02:03:58] My street, uh, with the neighbors in full view. And I was then taken to Lionsgate hospital and committed under the mental health act, uh, to a term of twenty-five days in, um, Hope center, which I now call \u201chopeless\u201d center and the parallels there, uh, between, uh, the corrupt, uh, money-making big pharma and what your other speakers were alluding to, uh, with Zoloft and the antidepressants is exactly the same. [02:04:36] So my sojourn, uh, of 25 days was a complete lockup and silencing. And, uh, I was removed from my, uh, any forms of communication, uh, and had brief opportunities to respond, uh, to my wife and my one daughter that\u2019s in Vancouver and a lawyer. And in one, four day period, I never got a chance to, none of them, uh, returned my call. [02:05:12] Dr. Daniel Nagase: So this is, this is the one thing I noticed both the nurses and the psychiatrist wrote on your medical record. And they wrote this repeatedly that you were delusional for talking about vaccine side effects and how, how dangerous these lipid nanoparticles work, especially to pregnant women and because the psychiatrists and nurses kept calling you delusional. [02:05:35] I think that\u2019s one of the reasons they forced, uh, Dr. Bruchet to take an anti-psychotic medication, which causes strokes, heart attacks, and death when given to people over the age of 65. So Mel Bruchet is 81 years old. And yet, despite knowing this, over and over again for the, about the last five days of your confinement in the psychiatric facility, they forced this medication on you calling extra security to threaten you physically, if you didn\u2019t take this medication, even though the doctors knew this is a dangerous medication in someone your age, and then, you know, on top of all that, there\u2019s the constitutional violation where they restricted your access to the phone, would not allow you to call friends and they severely limited your access to family members. [02:06:27] They even, um, they even stopped Father Augustine, your priest from coming to see you after Christmas. So this is really, this is inhumane treatment. And, and the fact that it\u2019s happening here in a hospital in Canada and while Mel was confined, Mel\u2019s team, all of his supporters on the outside tried repeatedly to get the police to investigate suspected abuse within the hospital. [02:06:58] And the police refused to investigate every single time. They refuse to investigate my complaint, where I was trying to tell the police, Mel was being forced to take a dangerous medication. And they said, no Mel is being cared for by good doctors and good psychiatrists. What an absolute lie. You know, reading Mel\u2019s medical chart makes me so disappointed and upset with the medical system in Canada, from the emergency doctor who decided that Mel had to be confined in a psychiatric facility for his own safety, with no basis, no objective basis to make that decision and sign those forms that took away Mel\u2019s rights. [02:07:40] To the psychiatrists that were basically lying about Mel for pages and pages and pages of psychiatric documents accusing him of being delusional because he thought vaccines had side effects. And then even the psychiatric nurses who refused to verify that they were giving a dangerous medication. [02:08:01] That\u2019s actually one of a nurses\u2019 jobs in Canada is if a doctor mistakenly orders, a medication that is dangerous for a patient, the nurse is supposed to verify and call the doctor and say, doctor, are you sure you want to give this medication to the patient? And then the doctor has to justify that the benefits from the medication outweigh the risks, which clearly was not the case for Dr. [02:08:25] Bruchet. So tell [02:08:27] him about your escape. [02:08:29] Dr. Mel Bruchet: Well, also, I would tell them that, uh, I had a lot of time on my hands and I was able to make copious notes on every encounter with the nurse, uh, who was, uh, trying to coerce me to take the medication, uh, and then threatened me with, uh, injecting it if I didn\u2019t, at the behest of the psychiatrist [02:08:54] of course. Uh, it was a complete mishmash. It was one flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s nest. I was telling them that I knew more psychiatry than they did because I spent, uh, 52 years in general, full service, general practice. And in that capacity, and in my internship in the states, I saw a tremendous amount of psychopathology and, uh, they didn\u2019t like that. [02:09:21] And every time I pushed their buttons and threatened to sue them, they got more draconian and aggressive, and locked me up even more. The good news is that I was able to get my, uh, 350 pages, uh, charting of, uh, records, which is incredibly damaging, uh, for the, uh, suits that we are, uh, are pending against the psychiatrist and the psychiatric nurses. [02:09:53] Uh, so there, there is some good to it and, uh, I\u2019ve definitely taken one for the team and it certainly wearing thin. Uh, I am still still on, still on the run and staying in halfway houses and people have been amazing in their, their support, their help, their food, their transportation, and everything else. [02:10:18] Dr. Daniel Nagase: 15 minutes after Mel didn\u2019t return from his two hours supervised pass. 15 minutes after he was too late from returning to the hospital, like he was ordered to do so by the psychiatrist, they issued a director\u2019s warrant for his arrest. So Mel currently has a federal warrant in Canada for his arrest. [02:10:42] So this is a very serious problem. That\u2019s why Mel can\u2019t go to his own home. He can\u2019t return to his own house or sleep in his own bed. Um, Mel is having to travel from city to city, to city, uh, traveling, going from safe house to safe house, uh, relying on our network of freedom fighters to basically have food and shelter and that speaks to another matter, actually, um, what we have done because we have access to Mel\u2019s [02:11:12] medical records is we\u2019re filing criminal charges of assault causing bodily harm and criminal negligence causing bodily harm. We\u2019re filing criminal charges against the hospital staff. And if these charges get approved by a judge, then that\u2019s a big, big step into holding these, these people accountable, because what happened in the hospital during Dr. [02:11:35] Bruchet\u2019s stay is absolutely unconscionable. [02:11:40] Dr. Mel Bruchet: And I think going forward, we have to recognize that we\u2019ve got to keep pedal to the metal. I think there\u2019s a tendency now that, that the system is falling apart worldwide. And particularly in Britain, there\u2019s a tendency to think it\u2019s over. It\u2019s not over. This is just the beginning of the beginning and we have to keep our ankles and our feet on their throats, because if we let up, uh, I mean, Trudeau is already trying to play this down and it, these people were illegally, uh, you know, he\u2019s trying to recreate a scene, uh, like in the states that they\u2019re gonna take over. [02:12:23] Well, hopefully we\u2019ll take over, because under his leadership, it is going to continue to be a psychosocial, moral, financial disaster that this country has become. And I think the other thing we have to do is document time, places, persons, names, pictures of the victims of this vaccine and document the, how do they manage to, to cover up 13 still borns in women\u2019s center in Vancouver in a 24 hour period. [02:13:01] Dr. Daniel Nagase: We have to get the names of all the people who are withholding information, who are telling lies by saying this vaccine is safe. We as people have to collect the names and the faces and the pictures of every single person in the media, at the hospital, who are lying about a dangerous vaccine, right? [02:13:23] Because I am, I am sick and tired of hearing politicians, health ministers, um, hospital administrators say over and over again that this vaccine is safe. This is the most dangerous vaccine in human history. Dangerous. [02:13:40] Dr. Mel Bruchet: And I think the, the last big evil force is social media. And even when you look now, uh, on the coverage of the truckers in Ottawa, a, on CTV and global and all the usual, uh, garbage Yay sayers uh, it\u2019s, it\u2019s basically a non event. [02:14:02] If you get into rumble and you get into the whistleblowers, then it\u2019s obvious that this is, uh, a spark for potentially a worldwide, uh movement with the truckers. I mean, you know, we bailed out Britain and, uh, during the second world war and the first world war and the British empire. It was Canadians who where some of the best troops and the, the least well equipped. [02:14:28] And it\u2019s about time that the Brits pay us back. I mean, they\u2019ve already had, they\u2019ve shut down the transportation between the EU and Britain, and they could do it again in a heartbeat. They just need to be prodded in that direction. [02:14:44] Dr. Daniel Nagase: But getting back to Canada, I think the big reason in Canada, why the mainstream media is so happy to lie and ignore coverage of the truckers that are saving Canada\u2019s freedoms is that in 2019, the Canadian parliament passed a law that removed [02:15:06] spreading false news from the criminal code. That was in 2019. So the people who\u2019ve been planning this, this absolute, um, atrocity and taking away our freedoms, they been working for decades to do this, right. They\u2019ve released the ability of media to lie as much as they want. And they removed it from the criminal code. [02:15:29] So media in Canada has zero accountability. And then on top of that, the Supreme court of Canada reaffirmed something called judicial notice in 2001. So that\u2019s 21 years ago. And what judicial notice does is it allows judges to declare something, to be a fact without offering any proof or evidence. So if a Supreme court judge in Canada says, I issue a judicial notice that the vaccines are safe, then that becomes a legal fact in Canada. [02:16:04] The judge doesn\u2019t have to give any proof or evidence that the vaccines are safe. All a judge has to say is I declare this a judicial notice that vaccines are safe. And from that point on, no evidence can be presented in court otherwise. This is a Supreme crime. This was 2001 in Canada\u2019s Supreme court. [02:16:28] And the disturbing thing is the American Supreme court system has a similar aspect called judicial notice where judges are allowed to declare fact without evidence. And the only caveat is that the judge has to believe that whatever they are declaring fact by judicial notice is obvious and uncontroversial. [02:16:52] So that means if a judge with no training in science, no training in philosophy, no training in human history, where people used to believe that the earth was the center of the universe, if some ignorant judge watches enough mainstream media that lies over and over again, that judge can be led to believe that well, it\u2019s obvious the vaccine\u2019s safe because CNN says so, or CBC says so. [02:17:18] Christof Plothe: I\u2019m sorry. [02:17:19] I have to interrupt you because we\u2019re running out of time, but thank you very much for sharing your story. And it\u2019s like so many other stories that we\u2019ve been witnessing in the last two years. It\u2019s like, um, uh, when is this movie going to end when I\u2019m going to wake up out of this, in this movie theater? [02:17:38] Because the stories like yours are happening everywhere, almost identical, and that is just a very worrying situation on our planet. And thank you for your considerations, um, how to get out of it. And I hope today\u2019s, um, um, events in Canada will spark a flame of hope to all of us, um, that, um, you will come to justice and, um, many other co fighters out there as well. [02:18:09] Thank you very much for your voice. Yeah. [02:18:11] Dr. Mel Bruchet: Certainly appreciate your efforts. [02:18:14] Christof Plothe: And we\u2019d like to thank all attendees today and, uh, please be aware that, uh, there will be a recording, uh, in 48 hours of everything that has been talked about tonight and as we are, uh, public and funded by the public for the people. So you\u2019re very welcome, um, to, um, assist us in this work, if you feel like it. [02:18:37] Um, otherwise we\u2019ll see you next Monday. See you next week and, um, um, for a positive outcome of tonight\u2019s meeting, I\u2019ll hand over to Shabnam with some lines she has chosen for tonight. [02:18:52] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you [02:18:53] Christof. In light of the brilliant gathering that we had today, I\u2019ve chosen four lines of a poem by Emily Dickinson. And the poem is called, is The Thing with Feathers. \u201cHope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul and things, the tune without the words, and never stops at all.\u201d [02:19:14] Dedicating that to everyone that participated now general assembly today. There is a better way. We are creating it together. [02:19:23] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: That was beautiful. Thank you so much, Shabnam. Thank you. Thank you everybody.
