And then the advert was removed.\n\nIn a Substack article posted on 3 February 2023 at 10:10 am, Naked Emperor highlighted a job advert placed by UKHSA. The job description read:\n\nWe guess that means a vaccination programme larger than the covid injection programme \u2013 unless it is simply sloppy writing by a low-grade employee who copy and pasted from an older job advert.\n\nThe advert stated it was open to applications until 11:55 pm on 14th February 2023. Usually, job adverts are open for at least a month. So this advert would have been first published in the middle of January. The salary on offer was up to \u00a362,286\n\nWe wanted to look at the job application for ourselves and take screenshots of it as a record. But when we followed the link, less than an hour after Naked Emperor published his article, this is what we found:\n\nIt has also been closed on the NHS Jobs website. LinkedIn implies someone has been hired for UKHSA\u2019s job but it could simply be a standard message shown by LinkedIn when a job advert is removed to keep up appearances:\n\nWhich is a shame because as The Conservative Woman\u2019s Kathy Gyngell tweeted: \u201cWill someone perform a public service and apply?\u201d\u201d\n\nBernie Spofforth has fortunately captured some screenshots and shared them on Twitter, see below.\n\nIts possible UKHSA has filled the role but it would be unusual and bad practise to close the application early. So perhaps the role has not been filled and the reason this job has been removed from the site is that it had been highlighted to the public, and/or within the civil service, during a time when civil service job cuts are being considered.\n\nAt the end of January, the Chancellor of the Dutchy of Lancaster, Oliver Dowden, had said that the UK government was going ahead with plans for job cuts in the civil service due to \u201cbudget pressures.\u201d\n\nDowden told MPs that there will be reduction in central government headcount planned in the year ahead, but did not endorse former prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s target to cut 91,000 jobs \u2013 around a fifth of the total civil service.\n\nThat plan aimed to bring the civil service headcount back to 2016 levels before numbers swelled due to the recruitment of policy specialists in preparation for Brexit and to deliver the government\u2019s response to the covid pandemic. Before those two events, there were around 384,000 civil servants in the UK. The number had risen to 479,000 as of last summer.\n\nIt would be interesting to know how much the civil service headcount swelled directly in response to the false covid pandemic and how much it swelled in response to implementing The Great Reset/Fourth Industrial Revolution, the true reason the \u201cpandemic\u201d occured.\n\nMeanwhile, civil servants have been striking for more pay.\n\nThe hypocrisy and irony of these events taken together are not lost on us.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "UKHSA wanted a Vaccine Supply Manager to deliver UK\u2019s largest Vaccination Programme \u201cdelivered at pace\u201d\u2026.
