But how are we exposed to aluminum?\n\nThis is how much we get cooking acidic foods like tomato sauce in an aluminum pot for an hour. Aluminum is also added to childhood vaccines as an immune irritant to improve efficacy. But it\u2019s come under fire from some parenting groups. This is how much you get smoking a pack of cigarettes, and this is how much you get if you use aluminum-containing antiperspirants. But researchers just found a food item that blows these other sources away.\n\nWhat do you think it is? Is it Brussels sprouts? Many of you wish it were Brussels sprouts! Cheese, chicken, eggs, fish, or shellfish?\n\nThe highest natural levels of aluminum are found in shellfish, but the highest level overall is in cheese. Why? Just like the poultry industry adds arsenic to chicken, the dairy industry adds aluminum to cheese, the #1 source of aluminum in the diet.\n\nWhy would they do that? The aluminum salts produce a \u201csmooth, uniform film around each fat droplet\u201d to prevent something called fat \u201cbleeding,\u201d and to give the cheese a softer texture, and \u201cdesirable slicing properties.\u201d\n\nSo if you\u2019re a parent worrying about the aluminum in vaccines, every grilled cheese sandwich you give to your kids is like injecting them with a dozen aluminum-containing vaccines.\n\nTo see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
