However, it is pretty obvious that the new measures are targeting unvaccinated people.\n\nThe French National Assembly approved a new bill on Jan. 6 amending the country\u2019s existing vaccine pass. In a 214-93 vote, French lawmakers at the lower house gave their thumbs-up to the proposal titled \u201cOn strengthening the tools of management of the health crisis and amending the code of public health.\u201d The bill superseded the health passes currently in use in the country.\n\nPrior to the bill\u2019s approval, health passes are issued to both vaccinated French citizens and those who recovered from COVID-19 infection within the past six months. Those who present a negative COVID-19 test result may likewise be given a health pass, albeit only valid for 24 hours.\n\nThe Jan. 6 proposal overrode the health pass with a new vaccine pass system, issued only to fully vaccinated French citizens and those who present a certificate of recent COVID-19 recovery. All citizens aged 12 and above are subject to the vaccine pass system, but those with medical exemptions are not.\n\nCitizens must present the vaccine pass as a condition of entry to different public venues and events. These include cafes, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, cinemas, museums, fairs, public seminars and trade shows. The vaccine pass is also required to board inter-regional public transport. (Related: Macron says French citizens who want to shop, dine, travel or worship must get vaccinated for covid.)\n\nThe new vaccine pass system is set to become effective when the French Senate approves it on Jan. 11 and French President Emmanuel Macron passes it into law by Jan. 15.\n\nThe Italian Council of Ministers mandated COVID-19 vaccination for people 50 years and older. Those who continue turning down the vaccine are set to face monthly fines. The measure announced on Jan. 5 is set to be effective on Feb. 15, 2022 and will last until at least June 15.\n\nAccording to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Italians who \u201cstubbornly refuse\u201d to get the COVID-19 vaccine will be slapped a monthly fine of \u20ac100 ($113) on a recurring basis. This fine is on top of the penalties ranging from \u20ac600 ($681) to \u20ac1,500 ($1,703) for unvaccinated workers imposed in 2021.\n\nPrior to the announcement, Italian workers were given an option to submit a negative COVID-19 test before entering their workplaces. The mandate by the council nullified that option for workers aged 50 years and up. However, those with a confirmed medical exemption and those who recently recovered from a COVID-19 infection are exempted from the Jan. 5 mandate.\n\nItalian Health Minister Roberto Speranza defended the mandate during the cabinet\u2019s meeting, saying that the decision was taken \u201cto reduce hospitalizations\u201d from COVID-19. He also pointed out that two-thirds of COVID patients admitted to hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nMinisters from the right-wing Lega Nord issued a statement in opposition to the mandatory vaccination for those aged 50 and up, Reuters reported. They said the measure was \u201cwithout scientific foundation,\u201d noting that an \u201cabsolute majority\u201d of COVID patients in hospitals \u201care well over 60.\u201d\n\nAustria\u2019s government announced a new mandatory vaccination bill on Dec. 9 that seeks to penalize those still rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine. Under this proposal set to last until 2024, unvaccinated people will face monthly fines unless they get injected with the COVID-19 shot. Vienna\u2019s move follows the country having one of the lowest vaccination rates in the continent.\n\nThe new bill states that all citizens 14 years old and above who remain unvaccinated will face fines of up to \u20ac3,600 ($4,089) every three months. This equates to a monthly penalty of \u20ac1,200 ($1,363) \u2013 which will be dropped in case they show proof of vaccination or a medical exemption. (Related: Austrians who refuse COVID vaccines to face MONTHLY fines under new law.)\n\nAustrian authorities will check a central vaccination database to see who are yet to be vaccinated. They will write to these people every three months to remind them to get vaccinated or secure an exemption before the next cutoff. The fines will then be imposed in case the unvaccinated people refuse to comply.\n\n\u201cAs an alternative, the authorities have the option to impose a [smaller] fine in shorter proceedings immediately after the vaccination deadline,\u201d Austrian Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said. He added that people\u2019s income and financial obligations would be taken into account in calculating the total fines they will pay.\n\nThe proposal must still receive approval from the Austrian Parliament before it becomes a law. If approved, it will take effect in February 2022 and last until January 2024.\n\nWatch the video below of InfoWars Europe\u2018s Dan Lyman telling Owen Shroyer about Europe locking down the unvaccinated.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMedicalMartialLaw.com has more about the unvaccinated being locked down in Europe and other parts of the world.", "opengraph": {"title": "European countries intensify restrictions targeting the unvaccinated", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2022-01-11-european-countries-intensify-restrictions-targeting-unvaccinated.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Three countries in Europe have intensified Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions amid the spread of the B11529 omicron variant in the continent.
