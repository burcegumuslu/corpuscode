It\u2019s a strange place to inhabit: in covering stories at the fringes of science and history, it is necessary to be passionate about what we\u2019re researching and writing about, while never having the fervent belief in those topics that usually engenders such passion.\n\nAs Robert Anton Wilson once wrote, \u201cbelief is the death of intelligence\u2026as soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort, or assumes certitude, one stops thinking about that aspect of existence\u201d. Instead, one has to be passionate about the idea that presenting theories and concepts outside the mainstream can help us grow.\n\nKeeping one\u2019s wits is especially necessary in the \u2019twilight zone\u2019 because, to be honest, this liminal space is populated with tricksters \u2013 or more mundanely put, with a host of people who are either (a) grifters looking for fame and/or money, or (b) outright deluded folk.\n\nAnyone who has looked back on the history of the subjects we cover, from ufology to conspiracies, will know there is a rogue\u2019s gallery of unscrupulous or crazy individuals and groups who have been peddling nonsense. But in the last few years I\u2019ve noticed the amount of bullshit out there in our space is spreading like a virus (without social distancing measures).\n\nAlt-right turd-blossom Steven Bannon famously said in 2018 that one of his strategies to avoid close inspection and criticism was to \u201cflood the zone with shit\u201d \u2013 in other words, to saturate a news space with misinformation so that readers no longer have the mental bandwidth to sift truth from fiction.\n\nFolks, the Twilight Zone is currently flooded with shit.\n\nI am no curmudgeonly skeptic \u2013 I\u2019ve run a site for two decades whose express purpose is to give a voice to weird ideas and science outside the current paradigm. Last year I wrote a piece about how science should be more open to discussing anomalies (\u201cSeeing the spaceship: why we need to pay attention to anomalies\u201c). But in the last few years I have felt like I have a full-time job fact-checking \u2018believers\u2019, rather than challenging orthodox and mainstream ideas \u2013 and I\u2019m sure many in the field have dismissed the Grail as \u2018turning into skeptics\u2019.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: all of us who like hanging out in the Twilight Zone have our own responsibilities. And first and foremost among them is to do no harm, and not profit in any way from lies and misrepresentation.\n\nBeyond that, we all must understand that the mainstream is the mainstream for a reason \u2013 because it\u2019s a body of knowledge that has been accumulated, tested, and (at least largely) passed those tests. Any anomalous idea is a challenger, and most times we\u2019re talking \u2018overweight washed-up challenger\u2019 coming up against Mike Tyson in his prime. As such, until that anomalous idea can go twelve rounds with the champ, it\u2019s a massive underdog. We all love supporting the underdog, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can box and you should be putting your life savings on him. Paradigm-shifting ideas are a rare occasion indeed, while social media in the modern world is a non-stop deluge of dubious claims.\n\nTo put it in a more serious way: if a guy on YouTube says that their research had proven that the element bismuth had antigravity powers, would you put some in your pocket and walk off the Empire State Building? Or would you demand some evidence?\n\nI make this point for a reason. The rapid flooding of the zone with shit in recent years has largely been in areas where I think there is real potential for harm, in particular with anti-vaccination propaganda, COVID-19 denialism, and the civil-war evoking QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nModern social media makes it easy for one dissenter or \u2018influencer\u2019 to go viral, while a thousand experts are ignored \u2013 just because an authority figure such as one doctor or scientist says COVID-19 doesn\u2019t exist, doesn\u2019t mean we get to reject the view of thousands of other doctors or scientists who believe otherwise. The anomalous claim must have evidence to back it up \u2013 and not the \u201chere\u2019s a few things to stoke your confirmation bias\u201d type of evidence while ignoring important other evidence that says otherwise. Modern bullshittery in the social media/YouTube age follows the \u2018active measures\u2019 playbook used by government intelligence agencies:\n\nWe must be more skeptical, we must be more responsible, in what we promote and how we promote it. Present the opposing sides of the debate, discuss it intelligently and with caveats, and be sure you follow reason rather trying to confirm your beliefs. Apart from avoiding doing harm to others and society, you\u2019re also helping ideas get openly evaluated and perhaps evolve good ones forward. By promoting the shit, you simply throw the good ideas and research into the toilet with it.\n\nIn 2018 I wrote about the absurdity of the QAnon conspiracy theory, and the dangers it could pose in the future, opening with the quote from Voltaire: \u201cThose who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.\u201d I noted a particular feature in a well-known picture of a QAnon believer that had escaped much attention: he had a noose on his t-shirt.\n\nHaving looked into QAnon quite a bit, I was aware that many were enthusiastic about the possibility of Democrat politicians being publicly hanged, and the t-shirt was visual evidence of this.\n\nToday, as I was finishing writing this piece, this imagery came out of Washington D.C: a literal gallows had been put in place outside the Capitol, as a number of QAnoners stormed the building.\n\nNow, more than ever, everyone involved in exploring fringe and alternative theories of history, science and conspiracy needs to take stock of where they are at: their beliefs, their internal biases, the actual probability of all these various claims being true, and perhaps most of all \u2013 their humanity. Remember Voltaire\u2019s warning, \u201cthose who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities\u201d.
