More than $9 billion of your tax dollars were given to vaccine companies for research and $22 billion of your tax dollars were then used to support vaccine distribution. The feds also shelled out another $10 billion to expand access and currently announced $3 billion more to spend on an ad campaign to combat vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThe US government spent over $130 for every man, woman, and child in America to push the COVID-19 vaccines and yet nearly half the country still refuses to get the jab. Why is that?\n\nEvery Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) releases the new information on reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The number of reports are at historical levels and more deaths and adverse events have been reported in just the last six months than the previous two decades \u2014 combined.\n\nIn the latest release, the data show that between Dec. 14, 2020 and May 28, a total of 294,801 total adverse events were reported to VAERS, including 5,165 deaths \u2014 an increase of 759 over the previous week. There were 25,359 serious injuries reported, up 3,822 compared with last week.\n\nAs the Free Thought Project has stated from the beginning, as not to set off the \u201cfact checkers\u201d it is important to point out that just because data is submitted to the CDC through VAERS, this does not in anyway mean that these reactions are directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIn fact, immediately after reporting these historically and utterly shocking numbers, the CDC reassures us that \u201ca review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets\u2014which has caused deaths.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the main limitations of VAERS data is that it cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event,\u201d reads the CDC\u2019s website. \u201cThis limitation has caused confusion in the publicly available data from VAERS WONDER, specifically regarding the number of reported deaths. There have been instances where people have misinterpreted reports of deaths following vaccination as deaths caused by the vaccines; that is not accurate.\u201d\n\nAs there were 292 million doses of the vaccine administered during that time frame, the death rate sits at 0.0017%. These numbers indicate that the overwhelming majority of people who receive the vaccine are completely fine. But ignoring the massive uptick in reports would be irresponsible.\n\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s own data, children are extremely unlikely to contract COVID-19 much less have complications from it. However, there is a new push to get children vaccinated. Since the vaccine was approved for children, among 12- to 17-year-olds, there were 40 reports of heart inflammation and 16 cases of blood clotting disorders.\n\nAccording to the CDC data, archived here at Medalerts.org, of the 5,165 deaths reported as of May 28, 24% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination, 16% occurred within 24 hours and 38% occurred in people who became ill within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nMedalerts uses the exact same raw data as the government but has an easier user interface and more powerful search capabilities. According to the most recent data:\n\nThis week\u2019s data for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 4,740 total adverse events, including 117 rated as serious and four reported deaths among 12 to 17-year-olds. The youngest deaths reported include two 15-year-olds (VAERS I.D. 1187918 and 1242573), a 16-year-old (VAERS I.D. 1225942) and one 17-year-old (VAERS I.D. 1199455). There were other reported deaths in children under 17 that could not be confirmed or contained obvious errors.\n\u2022 635 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to17-year-olds with 97% of cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, 2% to Moderna and 0.31% (or two cases) to J&J.\n\u2022 40 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) all attributed to Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\u2022 16 reports of blood clotting disorders, all attributed to Pfizer.\n\nDespite the skyrocketing number of post-vaccination adverse events reported to the CDC, Facebook and Twitter alike continue to ban accounts and censor content which shows nothing more than the CDC\u2019s own data. This is irresponsible at best and potentially criminal at worst.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen folks attempt to dismiss the number of reports, claiming they are being made by fake accounts or by folks attempting to manipulate the data to make the vaccine companies look bad. It is indeed true, according to the CDC that \u201canyone can file a report in the system.\u201d However, filing a false VAERS report intentionally is a violation of federal law punishable by fine and imprisonment.\n\nIt is also true that there have been asinine reports made to the system with one of the reports indicating the COVID-19 vaccine caused a gunshot wound. Obviously this is a false claim, but why isn\u2019t the data receiving more scrutiny? If the data alone is causing vaccine hesitancy, then why not investigate it, examine it, and clarify it?\n\nAre there 300,000 people risking fines or imprisonment to paint the vaccine manufacturers in a negative light? Maybe. We don\u2019t know. But we do know that instead of investigating the record number of adverse event reports, the government is spending billions in tax dollars to bribe people into getting the vaccine. Seems legit.\n\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.
