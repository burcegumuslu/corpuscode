There is no emergency. There never has been one. The numbers don\u2019t support it.\n\n2. This board is perpetuating the notion of an emergency to get money, to impose tyranny and to unlawfully force medical experimentation upon the populace. This so-called vaccine has only gotten an emergency use authorization under the guise of an emergency; otherwise the EUA is null and void (by the way, masks and covid tests are EUAs as well.)\n\n3. Even if this could be called an emergency, no emergency suspends one\u2019s rights. Rights cannot be taken from you.\n\n4. This board is perpetrating fraud, and fraud is a felony and a felony carries a prison sentence. You are hereby notified that if you engage in harassment, intimidation and/or retaliation against any member of the public including me, for this statement of truth, such actions will be reported to the FBI.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether vaccines work or not.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether this is even a vaccine or not.\n\nWhat matters is that each individual has sovereignty and authority over their own body.\n\nWe know what this board is doing.\n\nWe know exactly what this board is doing.\n\nThese so-called vaccine can never be required as a condition for commerce.\n\nAmong many laws that protect individuals from the excess power of government tyrants, here are three...\n\n1. EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION LIMITATIONS on All COVID-19 vaccines , which are under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and cannot be made mandatory.\n\nOn its website, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notes the following: \u201c\u2026Recipients must be informed\u2026 that they have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine .\u201d\n\n2. Forced vaccination violates the right to privacy, which is protected, secured and guaranteed by the 4th Amendment of the US and the constitution of this state.\n\n3. Forced vaccination is unlawful DISCRIMINATION, discriminating against those who have cell phones or want to participate in AI.\n\nFurther, forced vaccination is a violation of:\n\n- CA GOV Code 51, which protects FREE AND EQUAL access to ALL PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS.\n\nPublic Accommodations are \u201cprivate businesses engaged in commerce.\u201d That means retails stores, banks, restaurants, recreation, transportation \u2013 and entity, location or establishment that is open to the public is prohibited from discriminating against the entry of a member of the public.\n\n- CA GOV CODE 12926 (q) protects one\u2019s religious liberty and practice, including the ability to NOT PARTICIPATE in practices that violate one\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs\n\n- CA GOV CODE 37100 \u2013 prevents any creation, application or enforcement of a law or policy that violates the California Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.\n\n-- CA HSC 24171 and 24172 declare that individuals have the right to determine what is done to their own bodies and to refuse consent to medical experimentation without duress, coercion or influence\n\nWARNING TO ALL GOVERNMENTAL, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES AND PERSONS\n\nBased on the above, and on behalf of all those named and referenced herein:\n\n(a) No business or organization, including any governmental agency has the authority to force me or anyone else to take any and all COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any other vaccine;\n\n(b) No business or organization, including any governmental agency, has the authority to deny me any and all services provided to COVID-19 vaccinated individuals;\n\n(c) Denial of any such services, will be a violation of our God-given, Natural, Common Law, state and federal constitutional and international rights not to be vaccinated in any way or form without our consent, this includes our right not to be tracked based on our vaccination status; and\n\n(d) Any such government agency, business or organization, person\u2019s acting as offices of such entities, man and/or woman, violating our right not to vaccinate against COVID-19 will be liable under tort law and for deprivation of rights under color of law, and will be subject to lawsuits, accordingly.\n\nA tort, in common law jurisdiction and otherwise, is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. It can include intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, financial losses, injuries, invasion of privacy, and many other things. In summary, no COVID-19 vaccination can be required in order to operate in community and social life, whether it is to go shopping, to work, to visit recreational areas, to visit persons in medical establishments, to travel, to visit restaurants or any business, or to enjoy are God-given right to go about our lives without government or corporate interference.\n\nFailure to respect this, and any intent to violate anyone\u2019s right not to receive any vaccine for COVID-19 or any other disease may and will result in legal action against those involved:\n\n(1) In the case of government officials, coercing and forcing any person to take such vaccines is a violation of your Oath of Office, your obligation to protect our constitutional rights, and will strip you of any and all governmental immunity for acting outside of your authority; and\n\n(2) In the case of any business and organization, man or woman, coercing and forcing any person to take such vaccination in order to provide any services or to provide access to your establishment, will be considered a violation of constitutional rights, subjecting your business or entity, and you as a private citizen, a man or a woman, to legal action against all of your assets. Business and organization policies are not above the law.\n\nLEGAL NOTICE: If I am compelled or forced to vaccinate to receive your services and I am injured, it will be considered coercion, duress and against our will, and you will be held liable for any such injury. I note here that we are not refusing vaccination, we are simply declining such vaccination for the reasons noted herein, and as mandated by God, the highest legal authority.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "About Vaccines \u2014 THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/vaccines-1", "type": "website", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/611a920b48483a476ae2fb2d/1592257049474/Healthy-American-no-mask.jpg?format=1500w", "image:width": "1100", "image:height": "619"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
