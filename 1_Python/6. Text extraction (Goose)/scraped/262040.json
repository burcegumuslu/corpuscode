Babies have an innate desire to stay in constant contact with their caregivers for survival.\n\nIn most of the world, it\u2019s still the norm for children to sleep with their parents and/or grandparents all the way up until adolescence.\n\nBut in the Western world, parents are encouraged by doctors to let their babies \u201ccry it out\u201d in their cribs at as young as 2-months.\n\nBut Dr. Nils Bergman, a specialist in perinatal neuroscience and founder of the Kangaroo Mother Care movement, says being separated from their mothers all night is extremely stressful for babies and young children and stunts their brain development.\n\nEven after babies have \u201ccried it out\u201d and appear to be sleeping through the night, they are not getting restful sleep, which is essential for brain development.\n\nBergman monitored 16 infants while they slept on their mother\u2019s chest and while they slept in a cot by her bed. Their heart rate and irregular breathing revealed they were in three times as much stress when they slept alone.\n\nA baby is able to respond in a healthy way to short periods of stress, says Bergman\u2019s website:\n\nThe stress can be quite severe, but if mother is there all the time to comfort and soothe, there is no harm to the baby\u2019s brain. This is called \u201ctolerable stress.\u201d\n\nThen there is \u201ctoxic stress.\u201d High levels of stress hormones for long periods of time are toxic to the neurons that make the brain work. The stress hormone cortisol makes more neurons die off at a faster rate. This disrupts and disturbs developing pathways and circuits. With prolonged stress after birth, the brain is measurably smaller one year later.\n\nThe only difference between toxic and tolerable stress is the absence or presence of mother or father.\n\nWhen babies are separated from their mothers for a noticeable period of time, they interpret it as a state of emergency, Bergman says. Their heart rate and blood pressure increases and they wave their arms and legs and cry to get their mom\u2019s attention. This uses a lot of energy which the baby should be using to grow.\n\nBabies separated by only one meter from their mothers, in a crib at the bottom of the bed, showed double the levels of cortisol. Stress hormones cause wear and tear over time, damaging cells and organs.\n\n\u201cBut more ominous is that the baby feels abandoned, and feels that he must learn to fend for himself,\u201d Bergman says. The baby\u2019s brain wires the \u2018avoid\u2019 pathways as no one is meeting his needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the baby\u2019s protest signals are not heeded, the baby may go into an energy-conserving defense mode which lowers heart rate and temperature for prolonged survival,\u201d Bergman\u2019s wife Jill Bergman writes for an article published in Breastfeeding Today. \u201cThis state of \u2018freeze\u2019 may look like the baby is asleep, but recent neuroscience research has shown that baby can be firing avoidance pathways in the brain. A final stage of defense is called dissociation in which the baby essentially tunes out. The brain of the baby is wiring emotional pathways, adapting to cope with \u2018a dangerous world, where nobody loves me.\u2019\u201d\n\nA Psychology Today article argues that letting babies cry in cribs damages neuronal interconnections \u2013 or synapses \u2013 and makes them less intelligent, less heathy, more anxious, uncooperative and more alienated later in life.\n\nThe modern Western recommendations for sleep training, crying-it-out and self-soothing come from the also Western idea that children need to be taught independence. \u201cBut forcing independence on a baby leads to greater dependence,\u201d says professor of psychology Darcia Narvaez.\n\nIn small-band hunter-gatherer societies, parents attended to every need of babies and young children immediately. As a result toddlers felt confident and competent enough to walk into the bush on their own, Narvaez pointed out.\n\nShe also pointed to a study of rats with high and low nurturing mothers \u2013 \u201cThere is a critical period for turning on genes that control anxiety for the rest of life. If for the first 10 days of life you have a low nurturing rat mother (the equivalent of the first 6 months of life in a human), the gene never gets turned on and the rat is anxious toward new situations for the rest of its life, unless drugs are administered to alleviate the anxiety.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Parents Should Sleep With Babies At Least 3 Years for Optimal Brain Development, Pediatrician Says", "description": "Babies who co-sleep in cribs have bigger brains and more secure attachment, neuroscientist says\u00a0 Like all mammals, humans have been sleeping with their babies for millions of years.
