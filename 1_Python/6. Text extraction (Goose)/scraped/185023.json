However, the officials also noted that the bank\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, testified before Congress recently and stated that divesting from fossil fuels would lead America down a \u201croad to hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bank\u2019s apparent move to discriminate against politically disfavored industries is spilling over into its other activities. Recently, Chase closed the National Committee for Religious Freedom\u2019s (NCRF) account without explanation. After repeated requests to reinstate the account, Chase informed NCRF that it would only consider doing so if the non-profit agreed to disclose detailed information about its donors and the criteria used to decide which political candidates it supports,\u201d the letter noted, adding:\n\nThis is not the first time Chase has engaged in questionable incidents of de-banking. In 2021, WePay, a subsidiary of Chase, denied ticket payment processing services for a mainstream republican event hosted by the non-profit, Defense of Liberty. As justification, WePay cited a policy that barred payment processing services in connection with \u201chate . . . racial intolerance . . . or items or activities that encourage, promote, facilitate, or instruct others regarding the same.\u201d Such vague and ambiguous terms can easily be used to hide viewpoint-based discrimination.\n\nThere are other similar cancellation incidents that raise the specter of viewpoint bias. In 2021, Chase cancelled a credit card account connected to former general Michael Flynn for questionable reasons. That same year, Chase terminated the Arkansas Family Council\u2019s account because the organization was deemed \u201cHigh Risk,\u201d even though they had done business with the bank for over two years.\n\nThe state financial officers also said they are \u201cconcerned\u201d about the bank\u2019s recent pattern of \u201capparent politically motivated de-banking,\u201d which they say is likely a violation of the bank\u2019s fiduciary duty due to it \u201csacrificing profitable investment opportunities (e.g., fossil fuels) for political reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to sacrificing profitable investment opportunities (e.g., fossil fuels) for political reasons, the appearance of politicized de-banking harms the company\u2019s reputation with its customers. The freedom to bank and access financial services without fear of viewpoint-based discrimination is fundamental to maintaining the trust of people and institutions in a diverse and pluralistic society. The public backlash against Chase\u2019s questionable moves indicates growing public distrust of the company and invites heightened regulatory scrutiny that could substantially impact its financial performance,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe officials say they want Chase to take immediate steps to identify and stop the \u201cinternal drivers of political or anti-religious bias\u201d that could \u201cundermine its fiduciary obligations and impair the freedom of its customers to access financial services without fear of discrimination based on their political or religious views.\u201d\n\nAs noted by Breitbart, the letter was signed by various state financial officers, including Nebraska Treasurer John Murante, Alaska Commissioner of Revenue Adam Crum, Arkansas Auditor Dennis Milligan, Idaho Treasurer Julie Ellsworth, Indiana Treasurer Dan Elliott, Kansas Treasurer Steven Johnson, Mississippi Treasurer David McRae, Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick, Missouri Treasurer Vivek Malek, Nevada Controller Andy Matthews, North Dakota Treasurer Thomas Beadle, Oklahoma Treasurer Todd Russ, South Carolina Treasurer Curtis M.
