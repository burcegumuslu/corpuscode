They found that, in every case, the claims we hear from our vaunted government and TV experts about the risks and benefits of vaccines are demonstrably false.\n\nIn fact, they learned that the tiny, vaccine-free minority of Americans is far healthier overall than the vaccinated majority.\n\nBut let\u2019s step back for a moment to the questions we should all be asking about those familiar claims.\n\nIn its 2011 case, Bruesewitz v. Wyeth, the US Supreme Court acknowledged that vaccines cause injuries.\n\n\u201cThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) created a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related tort litigation and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing legitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too costly and difficult.\u201d\n\nThe Court noted that vaccine injuries are unavoidable.\n\nJustice Scalia noted that the FDA regulations specify no criteria for measuring, much less ensuring, the claimed safety or effectiveness of vaccines.\n\nTo make our answer even clearer, the law classifies vaccines as \u201cunavoidably unsafe products.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt above aptly notes the common and more direct synonym for the word unsafe. That synonym is: dangerous.\n\nTo emphasize the point, the 1986 law gave vaccine makers immunity from legal liability and created a no-fault vaccine court that compensates families for documented vaccine injuries and deaths out of a taxpayer fund.\n\nSo the answer to the question \u201cAre vaccines safe?\u201d is a solid and resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWe know for a fact vaccines are dangerous. They absolutely cause injuries and deaths. And yet \u201cthe authorities\u201d have decided for us that the benefits outweigh the risks. What is that decision based on?\n\n(Q) DO THE RISKS OF COMMON DISEASES OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF VACCINES?\n\n (A) WE DON\u2019T KNOW.\n\nThat\u2019s right: We. Don\u2019t. Know.\n\nWHY we don\u2019t know is a long story. But the key reasons are these:\n\u2022 real risks exaggerated, truth about those risks is suppressed by the authorities and the media. One on changes to the vaccine court\u2019s injury table from the US Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS) repeats empty claims of vaccine benefit and discounts the scope and severity of vaccine harms without a shred of proof.\n\u2022 benefits of common diseases are rarely acknowledged by the authorities. (Yes there are benefits of getting diseases, including reduction in the risks of more serious illnesses like\n\u2022 Emergency vaccine s (like those for covid-19) may not be properly tested in animals before being approved for Phase 1 human trials. Animal trials are crucial to determine how vaccinated subjects react later, when they are exposed to the wild virus, to ensure they don\u2019t create , which can trigger a dangerous, sometimes deadly, immune overreaction called a \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d\n\u2022 Vaccines not safety tested against harmless (inert) placebos like saline. They\u2019re tested against false \u201cplacebos\u201d consisting of other e vaccines already on the market or the most toxic ingredients in the new vaccine. That\u2019s why we never know how vaccines stack up against Nature, or random chance. Similarly, vaccine clinical trials never use fully unvaccinated control subjects . This is like a tobacco company claiming cigarettes are safe because they compared people who smoke 70 cigarettes per week to those who smoke 69 cigarettes per week.\n\u2022 never compared the long-term health of the vaccine-free have caught these infections the health of those who have been vaccinated\n\nDespite what we\u2019re told, we simply can\u2019t know whether getting common infections is more dangerous than getting vaccinations for them without studying the health outcomes of both vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects.\n\n(Q) ARE THE RISKS OF VACCINES \u201cRARE\u201d?\n\n (A) WE DON\u2019T KNOW.\n\nAgain, there\u2019s something vitally important we don\u2019t know about a widely and coercively used class of product.\n\nThere are many reasons we don\u2019t know how \u201crare\u201d (or common) vaccine injuries and deaths are. They include these:\n\u2022 The national Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) captures fewer than 1% of all vaccine reactions and deaths according to the government\u2019s own study by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. In other words, the system misses more than 99% of harms caused by vaccines. That means any statistics showing the number of adverse reactions must be multiplied by 100 for a reasonably accurate estimate.\n\u2022 None And there is no system that tracks long-term vaccine consequences that only emerge after months or years of immune overstimulation by vaccine toxins that can\u2019t be easily purged from the body.\n\u2022 None In three separate reviews of the best available science on claimed vaccine harms, the government\u2019s Institute of Medicine majority of studies were \u201cinadequate\u201d to either prove or disprove causation . This means the studies were so poorly designed and/or executed they can\u2019t prove , one way or the other.\n\u2022 vaccine schedule and the specific combinations of vaccines that children are routinely given at one time have never been studied for interactive or cumulative harms\n\u2022 never compared overall health vaccinated to that of vaccine-free\n\u2022 healthcare providers are taught, perhaps pressured, to see even distressing vaccine reactions as \u201cnormal,\u201d diseases and disorders that arise weeks, months or years after vaccination as \u201c unrelated coincidences .\u201d They may indeed see and worry about the declining health among patients, but never connect those declines with vaccines because the evidence that might connect them is lacking, inadequate or suppressed.\n\n\u201cRare\u201d can only be judged in relation to something else. In the case of vaccine harms, we need a substantial group of vaccine-free citizens and a clear accounting of their health issues to compare the relative \u201crarity\u201d (or frequency) of harms in people who get vaccines to the frequency of such harms in people who don\u2019t.\n\nThis reference population exists for moment, though their numbers are falling. And our esteemed authorities steadfastly refuse to study them.\n\nThat\u2019s why the answer to question three, \u201cAre vaccine risks rare?\u201d is also \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTHE LOOMING EXTINCTION OF OUR ENDANGERED VACCINE-FREE POPULATION\n\nJoy Garner realized that the most important group of people in America was being driven toward extinction by ever more forceful vaccine mandates, dwindling exemptions, and blatant coercion.\n\nHer survey group represents the desperately needed \u201ccontrol group\u201d for this massive experiment our authorities have been conducting on our children, and increasingly on adults, for at least 30 years now. Only the never-vaccinated among us can show us what life and health look like when we let our immune systems do their jobs and manage illnesses as they come along.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans\u201499.97%, or more than 329 million\u2014have been exposed to vaccines.\n\nBy contrast, our tiny group of vaccine-free citizens makes up only about 0.26% of the population, or roughly 800,000 children and adults.\n\nYet, curiously, they are often feared and blamed for all the ills of the majority. Do the healthy, unvaccinated few among us really have that much power?\n\nGarner saw the decline of the unvaccinated control population and knew it was vitally important to gather the wisdom manifested in their health trajectories while it was still possible. And it was important to protect this endangered species from extinction.\n\nGarner named her litigation The Control Group for obvious reasons. Her passion and love for others drove her to tackle this project our authorities should have done, and still should do on a larger scale.\n\nBut it was her intelligence and business experience that gave her the skills and confidence to pull it off.\n\nAfter all, at its core, the task was straightforward:\n\u2022 None Create a survey like the ones the authorities typically use to gather health data on Americans.\n\u2022 None Get the survey into the hands of the target population (the never-vaccinated).\n\u2022 None Crunch the numbers from the surveys, and validate the results.\n\u2022 None Compare health outcomes from the survey results to national health statistics for the vaccinated majority.\n\nThe survey instruments themselves were streamlined into two forms, and the process followed appropriate protocols for collecting and reporting health data for litigation. The forms prompted respondents to report all illnesses and disabilities.\n\nGarner reached the subject population by promoting the survey through social media, radio interviews, events, referrals and other means.\n\nSurveys were manually completed and mailed back (or handed back at events) to help eliminate some of the flaws in online, electronic surveys.\n\nFollow-up calls clarified unclear answers and helped ensure participants recalled and reported all health issues.\n\nGarner compiled and evaluated the results using established statistical practices, and engaged experts in relevant fields to validate the forms and the process as well as the results.\n\nAnd she acquired comparable statistics for the vaccination population from national health reports.\n\nIn the end, survey respondents represented a solid 0.179% of the entire vaccine-free population, estimated during the survey period at around 832,521 Americans, and ranged in age from under 1 year to 73.\n\nFrom the data on both groups\u2014the vaccinated and the never-vaccinated\u2014her team generated graphs that tell a powerful story, one every American, indeed, every citizen of the world, should hear. Now. While they still can.\n\nIn every case, the vaccinated majority of Americans (shown in orange) experienced far more illness and dysfunction than the vaccine-free survey population. How much more? See for yourself.\n\nThe first graph shows that at least 27%* of America\u2019s vaccinated children have chronic health conditions in general. That\u2019s 10 to 20 million kids and families dealing every day with issues ranging from allergies, asthma and rashes \u2026 to ADHD or autism \u2026 to epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, or even cancer.\n\n* Because the definition of \u201cchronic illness\u201d has changed over the years, this chart uses the same 2010 national health data used to calculate a Pearson Correlation Coefficient showing a very high correlation between the CDC vaccine schedule and childhood chronic disease. As of 2020, the national rate of chronic illness is closer to 54% or higher.\n\nVaccinated kids are 3.5 times more likely to have one chronic illness and 5.7 times more likely to have multiple chronic conditions.\n\nThat means more family disruption, more medication and doctor visits, more expenses, and more risk from complications of infectious diseases like covid-19.\n\nFor our adult population, with their cumulative exposures to vaccinations, the picture is even more dramatic\u2026and disturbing.\n\nNational statistics show that vaccinated adults are 9.5 times more likely to have chronic conditions, including asthma and arthritis, plus some of the leading causes of death such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illness, and cancer.\n\nVaccinated adults are 43 times more likely to have two chronic conditions.\n\nAnd 12% of the vaccinated have five chronic illnesses. These are the people we\u2019ve heard about on the news who are at increased risk of hospitalization and death from infectious diseases like covid-19. Yet NONE among the vaccine-free population fall into that highest-risk category.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how these general health issues manifest in specific illnesses.\n\nVaccinated children are many times more likely to suffer from asthma, eczema, food allergies, ear fluid, and strabismus (eye alignment issues).\n\nVaccinated populations also have far more developmental and neurological issues, learning disabilities, speech disorders, epilepsy, ADHD, and autism.\n\nFor example, the rate of ADHD is 19 times more common in vaccinated kids.\n\nSignificantly, NO vaccine-free babies had died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nAnd NO vaccine-free children had cancer.\n\nVaccinated people had 44 times more digestive disorders, and a whopping 207.5 times more chronic sinusitis (sinus infections).\n\nIllnesses they DIDN\u2019T SEE in the vaccine-free population\n\nPerhaps most astounding is the range of illnesses the vaccine-free subjects just didn\u2019t have. The contrast between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated are illustrated in the graphics below. The vaccine-free had ZERO adult ADHD and asthma, ZERO arthritis, ZERO diabetes, ZERO heart disease, and even ZERO cancer.\n\nTo bring this message home, The Control Group\u2019s statistical analysis of national health data shows a \u201cvery high correlation\u201d between the increases in children\u2019s health problems and the increases in vaccination since 1994.\n\nThese are not coincidences.\n\nRegardless of whether this survey fully reflects the overall vaccine-free population, the data collected here are more than compelling enough to warrant further inquiry.\n\nAny study can and should be challenged. That\u2019s what real science is all about. The Control Group pilot survey is no exception.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that two other studies (Hooker/Miller, and Thomas/Weiler-Lyons) were also released in 2020 comparing health outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects.\n\nAnd in all three studies, the same pattern emerged: the vaccinated experienced far more overall illness and dysfunction than the vaccine-free.\n\nSo, while we may be inclined to take one, perhaps even two, studies with a grain of salt, when three independent studies\u2014approaching the same question from three different perspectives, using different subjects\u2014all tell the same story, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look and conducting well-funded, comprehensive studies.\n\nIn fact, The Control Group\u2019s Joy Garner has already designed and proposed such a study for the government to sponsor or conduct.\n\nMany questions remain. The resources listed at the end of this article provide more detailed information.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many Americans are vaccine free\n\nBecause federal agencies\u2014like the Census Bureau in its National Survey of Childhood Health, which routinely surveys Americans\u2019 health status\u2014don\u2019t bother to collect data on vaccination status, we cannot know the exact percentage of the population that\u2019s never been exposed to vaccines. Most researchers estimate that number at well below 1%, more likely at 0.26%.\n\nWe can reasonably assume that any national health data includes that tiny number of never-vaccinated Americans. However, the results of these 2020 studies all suggest that, if the unvaccinated skew the national health statistics at all, they cause the true scale of our devastating national health crisis to be underestimated.\n\nThe Control Group had higher percentage of children than the overall population\n\nIn all fairness, this pilot survey surveyed toward the youthful side with nearly 86% of respondents under 18 and only 14% adults, whereas the national population has about 23% in the 0-18 group and 77% adults. Therefore, the data regarding illnesses that typically appear or increase in prevalence with age may be underrepresented in any of the combined (children and adults) results reported here.\n\nHowever, this disproportion between unvaccinated children and adults in the pilot study only highlights the difficulty we face of sustaining a fully-representative, natural control group through which to judge the overall effectiveness of public health measures like mass vaccination.\n\nSimply put: the older we get, the harder it is to remain vaccine-free. Jobs increasingly require vaccinations. Today we see pressures to vaccinate for travel and for admission to events and facilities. We may even be vaccinated during medical procedures without realizing it. And seniors in assisted living or nursing facilities are frequently urged to vaccinate and may face discrimination or loss of benefits if they refuse.\n\nOur natural control group of vaccine-free citizens is an endangered species and must be protected from extinction.\n\nTHE LEGAL CASE: PROTECTING THE VACCINE-FREE, FREEING EVERYONE\n\nGiven that vaccines are demonstrably dangerous yet their true risks have never been properly measured and quantified by the authorities using an unvaccinated control group, this practice of near-universal vaccination by public policy constitutes a massive medical experiment perpetrated on the American population without their fully informed consent. It must be halted until we have better data available.\n\nIn 2021 Informed Consent Legal Defense and The Control Group leaders and participants are bringing to federal court mountains of evidence for vaccine harms, with reasons to protect the unvaccinated and the right of everyone to freely give or refuse to give informed consent for vaccinations. Their first court appearance will be on Feb 22, 2021.\n\nThey are asking the Federal Judge for a Preliminary Injunction that will conditionally stop current mass vaccination policies and pressures until such time as the overall risks of vaccines are properly measured and reported by the government using a large group of never-vaccinated Americans as controls for comparison.\n\nThis legal action, if successful, will achieve one or more desired outcomes, including:\n\u2022 None Ensure that a wealth of critical facts about known vaccine risks are on the official record.\n\u2022 Document the scope of dangerous unknowns about vaccine risks and recognize the nature of current mass vaccination policy as \u201cexperimental.\u201d\n\u2022 Ensure the results of The Control Group \u2019s pilot survey and their proposal for a large-scale, auditable survey are on the official record.\n\u2022 None Protect the endangered vaccine-free population and those who wish to make their own choices regarding vaccination, by authorizing the following actions:\n\u2022 None Remove from citizens the burden to prove vaccines caused their injuries and shift that burden of proof to the government to calculate and prove the benefits of vaccinations outweigh their lifetime risks. And until such time as the government publishes quantified proof of safety and \u201crarity\u201d of risk, this action will also:\n\u2022 None Prohibit the practice of referring to vaccines as \u201csafe\u201d in marketing and promotion.\n\u2022 None Protect free citizens\u2019 rights to give or withhold informed consent for medical experimentation, including for vaccination.\n\u2022 None Make all vaccinations voluntary, and authorize a proposed universal vaccine exemption called the National Informed Consent Exemption (NICE).\n\u2022 None Make any laws, regulations or policies unenforceable if they discriminate against or segregate free citizens based solely on their refusal to consent to medical experimentation in the form of vaccination.\n\u2022 None Prosecute any acts of discrimination or segregation that are based solely on vaccination status.\n\u2022 None Free parents from any charges of medical neglect, or denial of medical care for their children based solely on vaccination choices and status.\n\nRegardless of our individual beliefs, we should all want to know whether vaccines make us healthier or sicker as a human community. And if they are, indeed, harming us and our children for a lifetime in exchange for suppressing typically mild, short-term illness symptoms, we need to completely overhaul our public health policies.\n\nWe also need to review our personal choices, as well as The Control Group\u2019s graphic revelations of health experiences in the lives of those who do and don\u2019t use vaccines, then ask ourselves: Which life do I want to live? Which life do I want for my family?\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, CHECK OUT THE LINKS BELOW.\n\n(1) The Control Group survey: \u201cStatistical Evaluation of Health Outcomes in the Unvaccinated.\u201d This page provides links to the survey\u2019s documents, including the full report and the actual forms used to collect the data, and the full-page graphs depicting their comparisons of health outcomes for vaccinated and surveyed unvaccinated populations.\n\n(2) The 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) protects vaccine makers from legal liability for vaccine injuries and deaths, with the intention to make it easier for victims\u2019 families to receive compensation for many known and unknown harms caused by vaccines. That goal has not been met.\n\n(3) The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) executes the NCVIA, managed mostly within the HRSA under the HHS, but uses Department of Justice (DoJ) lawyers to oppose victims\u2019 families in vaccine court.\n\n(4) The Bruesewitz ruling effectively stopped all lawsuits against vaccine makers for design defects. In Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (2011), the Supreme Court affirmed and reinforced the fact that the 1986 law acknowledged the unavoidable dangerousness baked into the design of vaccines and freed vaccine makers from legal liability for injuries and deaths caused by product design defects. Plaintiffs can still sue for manufacturing flaws, contamination, or even for the drug company\u2019s failure to provide warnings and disclose all known or suspected side effects. But not if the product works as designed and still causes harm.\n\n(5) \u201cUnavoidably unsafe products\u201d are discussed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Restatement of Torts (Second) 402A (k) \u00a7 402A.

Almost all individuals who are vaccinated have no serious reactions.\u201d We\u2019ve already shown that we have insufficient data to show the real vaccine risks and the \u201crarity\u201d of them.\n\nVaccination is NOT the best way to protect: \u201cIt is true that natural infection almost always causes better immunity than vaccines.\u201d https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/immune-system-and-health And the risks from most common diseases are wildly exaggerated.\n\n(7) Informed Consent Defense.
