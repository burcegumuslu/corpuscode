Blood cells are easily visible under a microscope. Their shape, type, and how and if they are aggregated\u2014clumped together\u2014can help the skilled physician better understand the patient\u2019s health.\n\nIn their 60-page peer-reviewed study, the Italian researchers reported case studies from their observations. Although they could not explain what they observed, they noted in the study that what they saw was so strange that they felt the need to alert the medical community.\n\nThe light or optical microscope uses visible light and a series of lenses to magnify small images.\n\nUnlike electron microscopy, light microscopy provides a direct image of what is under the lens. With light microscopy, scientists can either use a bright white background behind the cells, with the light shining from behind the slide, or they can use a dark background.\n\nThis technique, which is called dark-field or dark-ground microscopy, works by blocking the backlighting and bouncing the light around from the side in order to make the slide stand out from the dark background. Dark-field microscopy uses a special aperture to focus the light so the background stays dark. The light will not pass directly through the sample, and no staining is required, so living cells do not need to be killed to be studied. For this research, the doctors used dark-field microscopy.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Star Chamber Justice", "The 5G Beast", "Neoliberals", "Battle Against Degeneracy", "Scamdemic", "Sub-Zero Kakistocracy", "Greenwashing", "(p)Harma Industry Skulduggery", "Faux Democracy & Voting Fraud", "9/11", "Astute Commentary", "True Crime", "Banksters / Financial Manipulations", "Muslim Demonization Agitprop", "Race Industry", "You Can't Make This Stuff Up", "Jewish Power & Influence", "Control of the Internet", "Cultural Marxism", "GMO & Toxins", "Suppressed & Hidden History", "Debt Slavery", "Brainwashing & Propaganda", "Neocons", "Identitarians", "Grand Solar Minimum / Cold Sun", "Threats to South African Whites", "Social Engineering", "Staged Deceptions & False Flags", "White Demonization Agitprop", "Migration as Weaponized War", "Transhumanist Scheming", "Media Lies & Fabrications", "Economic Statecraft", "Fight Club Memes & Tactics", "George Soros Skullduggery", "Israel & Zionism", "Suppression of Free Speech", "Globalization", "New Underworld Order", "Police State / Big Brother"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.technocracy.news/peer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-blood", "https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/47", "https://www.technocracy.news/peer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood/", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/09/peer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2022%2F09%2Fpeer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Ftorch-resize.png%3Ffit%3D32%252C96%26ssl%3D1&description=Peer-Reviewed%20Study%3A%2094%25%20Of%20Vaccinated%20Patients%20With%20Subsequent%20Health%20Issues%20Have%20Abnormal%20Blood", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Peer-Reviewed%20Study%3A%2094%25%20Of%20Vaccinated%20Patients%20With%20Subsequent%20Health%20Issues%20Have%20Abnormal%20Blood&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2022%2F09%2Fpeer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/09/peer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/09/peer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
