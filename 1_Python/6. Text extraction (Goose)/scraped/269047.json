Recently the concern has escalated as Big Rx and Big Ag have begun lobbying against any labeling requirement for animal products which contain mRNA as part of the vaccine protocol.\n\nRecent studies have shown in mice that mRNA can transfer to the bloodstream from food ingestion (milk). The potential to use the food supply as a vaccine pathway into humans is raising alarm bells as the long-term consequences are unknown. Against this backdrop Dr Peter McCullough appears with Emerald Robinson to share his concern and strong support that mRNA vaccines should not be used in any animal within the food supply. {Direct Rumble Link}.\n\nThere are many concerns about mRNA technology in the food supply that extend well beyond just the animal vaccine protocol. The part of the interview concerning the food supply begins at 07:00 of the video.
