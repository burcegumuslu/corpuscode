Posted in Latest news\n\nRemember the days when \u2014 pre-presidency! \u2014 Joe Biden used to be given to uttering gaffes? He would utter a lot of them.\n\nI remember him in debate with the pulchritudinous Sarah Palin. In fact, he made so many gaffes we began calling him the gaffable Joe Biden. We may look back on those days and call them the \u201cGood Old Days.\u201d\n\nNow he garbles whole press conferences. As the Wall Street Journal said of his interview with Anderson Cooper last week, \u201cMr. Biden often doesn\u2019t seem to know what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nThe president was talking about nothing in particular when he moved on to the high price of oil in the here and now.\n\nHe blamed the high price of oil on OPEC and not the Democrats\u2019 war against fossil fuels produced in America. Then he said that \u201cultimately \u2026 investing in renewable energy\u201d is the answer. Yet that might take 20 years or more. Who knows?\n\nI thought about Joe\u2019s claim that the answer to our energy problem is \u201crenewable energy\u201d as I drove north along I-95 headed to a meeting in New Jersey.\n\nAs I crossed Delaware \u2014 Joe\u2019s home state \u2014 and into New Jersey, I noticed an enormous number of semi-trucks and tankers and pickup trucks along the way. For that matter, I noticed hundreds of SUVs here on I-95 and thousands of other gas guzzlers.\n\nThere must be millions of internal combustion engines on the roads of America. How are we going to dispose of them in a decade or two, according to Joe\u2019s plan? Will we all buy Teslas? Can Americans afford the sudden obsession with ending our reliance on fossil fuels? I am not so sure.\n\nI do not doubt that our reliance on fossil fuels in, at least, a minor way contributes to global warming. Perhaps in a major way, our reliance on fossil fuels contributes to global warming, though there is no evidence of it.\n\nMy trouble is that we do not have the solution to the problems created by fossil fuels. The president\u2019s plan to impose renewable energy on the nation is not feasible.\n\nIt is another left-wing, pie-in-the-sky solution to a problem that is much greater than the left-winger will admit to.\n\nIt is like gun control. Just gather up the nation\u2019s guns. That means gathering up over 300 million guns from private citizens. Will no one complain? And how about knives? Or possibly forks?\n\nThe problem \u2014 and it is a problem that is only beginning to be addressed \u2014 is that we do not have any way to eliminate fossil fuels that will not wreck the economy.\n\nThis economy depends on growth. Any slowdown means trouble. Any major slowdown means major trouble. All the reports that I am aware of predict a major slowdown for our economy if we continue on the path we are going.\n\nImagine Joe\u2019s plan of \u201cultimately \u2026 investing in renewable energy.\u201d That would mean shutting down roughly 8% of our economy. It would not work, and frankly, I cannot imagine that Joe thinks it will work. His only hope is that he will be dead by the time his plan is completed.\n\nThere is a way to treat the problem of fossil fuels. The free market might just be able to develop alternatives to fossil fuels, which it has yet to do. Yet it is not out of the question.\n\nThe free market did develop a vaccine to treat COVID-19 recently in record time, and it did so despite the highly-regulated pharmaceutical industry.\n\nOf course, the man who pushed for the development process was Donald Trump. He pushed for speeding up the development of the vaccine. He pushed for speeding up the testing of the vaccine\u2019s safety. And he pushed for speeding up the distribution of the final product.\n\nMoreover, what was learned through this speeded-up process may speed up the process of development and distribution of other vaccines in the future. Donald may be on the path to a Nobel Prize!\n\nWould it not be an irony that Trump\u2019s work with the COVID-19 vaccine helps with solving the problems associated with fossil fuels? He would find a way to get research and development rolling.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s work with fossil fuel may bankrupt the economy, Trump\u2019s work with vaccines many win him the Nobel Prize.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden's Harebrained Energy Policies Will Wreck The Economy", "description": "The problem is that we don't have any way to eliminate fossil fuels without destroying the country.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2021-10-28T14:23:29+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cartoon-net-zero-biden.jpg?fit=1001%2C786&ssl=1", "image:width": "1001", "image:height": "786", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cartoon-net-zero-biden.jpg?ssl=1", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/with-gas-prices-high-biden-tells-opec-drill-baby-drill/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/higher-prices-are-the-cost-of-bidens-war-on-energy/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-green-raw-deal-bidens-suicide-pact-with-the-radical-left/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-build-back-better-is-a-fable-that-will-wreck-the-economy/", "https://townhall.com/columnists/emmetttyrrell/2021/10/28/bidens-energy-policies-threaten-to-wreck-our-economy-n2598161", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Biden%27s%20Harebrained%20Energy%20Policies%20Will%20Wreck%20The%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fbidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-harebrained-energy-policies-will-wreck-the-economy/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2021-10-28T14:23:29+00:00"}
