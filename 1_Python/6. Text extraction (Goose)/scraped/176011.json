We would also call on the Irish Government to commit to not using such a system in respect of accessing goods and services within Ireland.\n\n\u201cIn relation to international travel, we identify serious human rights challenges with any system of Covid vaccine certificates or passports, particularly in the context of the present shortage of supply of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nAsking for more information on the Irish government\u2019s position in relation to EU proposals for vaccine certificates, the group proposed that the Department of Foreign Affairs \u201cconduct a comprehensive human rights impact assessment of any proposals for vaccine or immunity passports of certificates.\u201d\n\nThe EU Commission last week indicated that a system of digital travel certificates would likely be created before the summer, which, if passed by the EU parliament, would detail whether the traveller has had a negative PCR test result, immunity following recovery from the virus, or been vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nAn EU Commission official said the system would cease to operate after the WHO confirm an end to the pandemic.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Irish News"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://gript.ie/irish-council-vaccine-certificates/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
