If my body needs to detox it will do it naturally.\n\nGet this....people who clean up their diet, start fasting, practicing the WHM etc etc tend to get sick FAR less than your average McDonalds goer, I wonder why that is.\n\nI was kind of hoping to get the disease (if it exists as we are told it does, who knows at this point) just to show how for a normal, healthy 20 year old it is very easy to overcome naturally. I have my plan already in place as soon as symptoms hit from studying multiple doctors who aren't pumped with backhanders from GSK and co.\n\nThe basis of the protocol is this:\n\nStabilized Allicin and 150mg Vitamin C as optional extras\n\nWhen Sick/ First sign of cold/ flu/ corona virus- Zinc Losenge every 2 hours until better, Sterimar Copper spray x6 per day\n\nBeyond this the basics such as- Intermittent Fasting& weekly 24 hour fast, Wholefoods diet, Water (ideally fluoride free) and Herbal teas only- currently also no Coffee, Wim Hof Method- Cold Exposure plus breathing daily, 1+ hour of exercise every single day + Sun exposure for vitamin D.\n\nSadly my Gym is shut so can't do serious weight training or Heat therapy atm. Any other tips welcome @TrynaBeTurquoise @DrewNows @Moreira\n\nHowever, for my Mum (a HEAVY smoker and generally unhealthy person) I would probably suggest her getting the Vaccine, as 1) she's not going to stop smoking and 2) she has early onset Diabetes, therefore, it's kind of a lost cause at this point.\n\nSo, for her and elderly people unless they want to suddenly sort out their health (surprisingly people are so scared yet won't stop their bad habits lol, anyone with Diabetes right now why are you not reading books like Dr Barnards etc!) a vaccine, sadly, probably is the best solution.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Mandatory Vaccination", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/47716-mandatory-vaccination/", "description": "\n\n\tWill you guys be willingly taking the COVID vaccination if it turns out to be mandatory?
