While coconut oil does have a very high level of saturated fat, more than 50% of those saturated fats are medium-chain triglycerides, a good type of fat that can help improve your cholesterol levels. This is in addition to the many other effects of the fatty acids in this oil, such as capric acid, caprylic acid, linoleic acid, and many more. With anti-fungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, adding this oil to your dog\u2019s diet is an excellent way to supplement their diet. [1]\n\nThe benefits of coconut oil for dogs include improved digestive function, boosted immunity, and increased skin protection, among others.\n\nCoconut oil can optimize digestion, increase nutrient uptake, regulate bowel movements, and even eliminate bad breath in your dogs. [2]\n\nThe antibacterial, anti-fungal, and antiviral effects due to the presence of lauric acid in this oil help boost your dog\u2019s immunity and can prevent many gastrointestinal infections.\n\nAs your dog ages, more inflammatory conditions may arise, including arthritis, but the anti-inflammatory effects of MCTs are well known, so regular supplementation can definitely help your pooch. [3]\n\nThe abundance of healthy fats in this oil can improve the appearance and luster of your dog\u2019s coat, and protect the skin!\n\nHow Much Coconut Oil Can Dogs Have?\n\nWhen you are just starting to give your dog coconut oil, you should always start small, with no more than 1/4 teaspoon per day for puppies or small dogs. Watch your dog\u2019s reactions and ensure there are no gastrointestinal issues. If you have a larger dog, 1 teaspoon should be fine to start with. Over the course of a few weeks or months, you can gradually increase the amount. As soon as you see any negative side effects, scale back the amount. Generally, dogs shouldn\u2019t have more than 1 teaspoon per 10 pounds of body weight per day.\n\nThe most common side effects include gastrointestinal distress, diarrhea or loose, greasy stools. This can be avoided through moderation and by slowly increasing their overall intake.
