Just how do researchers \u201cbreak down\u201d or weaken a virus? They add mutations.\n\nMutations are those rare errors that accumulate as DNA is copied. \u201cSilent\u201d mutations have no major visible effect because they do not result in a change in protein sequence. A sample of normal DNA and another sample of the same DNA with silent mutations will both produce the same protein. However, organisms and viruses have a bias for the normal DNA and against DNA that has certain silent mutations. Therefore, if enough silent mutations accumulate in DNA, the virus\u2019 bias slows protein production, thereby weakening the virus.\n\nIn recent studies, researchers have engineered hundreds of silent mutations into a poliovirus that will be strong enough to train our immune systems, but weak enough to avoid causing disease. In order to get approval to use such altered-virus vaccines, \u201c\u2026researchers will have to show that the wimpy strains can't mutate and cause disease\u2014the big worry with any live-attenuated vaccine. But the fact that so many mutations are involved should minimize chances of this happening, says Mueller,\u201d lead author of a paper on the subject.2\n\nNotice that \u201cmany mutations\u201d lead to weaker, less-fit viruses. However, these mutations are not in critical positions, but rather are benign enough to be called \u201csilent.\u201d So if silent mutations can cripple a virus (as these researchers have demonstrated), what could they do to organisms like humans?\n\nIn his book Genetic Entropy and the Mystery of the Genome,3 Dr. John Sanford has calculated the likelihood of nature spontaneously selecting beneficial mutations over non-beneficial (the majority of which are silent). The non-beneficial mutations always far outpace the beneficial, adding up relentlessly generation after generation and eventually leading to a catastrophic population collapse.\n\nResearch indicates clearly that mutations do not lead to evolutionary progress, new functions, or even new information.4 They just lead to weakness, defects, and death. What an encouragement to know that the God of the Bible has revealed that we can be reconciled to Him through Christ.5 For those who believe in Him, death\u2014whether by mutation or any other cause\u2014will not have the final victory.6\n\u2022 Coleman, J.R. et al. 2008.
