The Italian lockdown was only a few days old, and it was plainly not Merkel\u2019s intent to go down the path of mass containment. The United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and likely a few other countries too still planned for an ordinary approach to Corona, with minimal mitigations. All the while, though, Team Lockdown was hard at work behind the scenes, to bend policy in their direction. As a leaked email from 20 March shows, German medical bureaucrats deputised by the Ministry of the Interior were soon consulting experts on how best to instil \u201cfear and a willingness to obey in the population.\u201d Because Western governments doubted their capacity to enforce Chinese-style lockdowns outright, fomenting mass panic became a non-pharmaceutical intervention in its own right. The histrionic media messaging has continued to this day, and it has contributed to a profoundly important division in our society: There are on the one hand those people in essential roles, who have endured exposure to Corona from the beginning, and most of whom have had the virus by now. And there are on the other hand those in Martin Kulldorf\u2019s \u201claptop class,\u201d that is to say well-off urban professionals, who have spent most of the last 21 months at home, hiding from a virus that many of them believe is approximately as dangerous as SARS. Mass infections among these people are only starting to happen right now. As members of this privileged, sheltered class, politicians and bureaucrats have absorbed the virus hysteria that they helped seed in their social milieu. In the beginning, Merkel did not especially fear the possibility of mass infections in Germany. Six months of press hysteria later, in October 2020, she had grown accustomed to carrying two plastic envelopes in her bag. One was for the careful, hygienic disposal of used surgical masks. The other carried precious new ones, whenever she judged her current mask had reached a dangerous state of virus saturation. [..] Merkel\u2019s remarkable virus paranoia, quietly acknowledged by the press now for months, explains her fixation on social isolation, closures and curfews as the only acceptable pandemic policies. She is a 67 year-old sedentary woman who likely suffers from one or more undisclosed health problems. And she is surrounded by other older, unfit government officials, like 73 year-old interior minister Horst Seehofer, who nearly died of a B19 virus infection in 2002, and so has a reason to fear viral infection. For months and months, all of these people have been taking every possible personal precaution \u2013 including house-arresting the entire domestic populations of the countries they govern \u2013 in the vain hope of escaping Corona. You could feel their collective relief when the vaccines were rolled out. All of them eagerly accepted vaccination. Merkel even provided pictures of her personal yellow vaccine pass to the press, with the stamp documenting her first dose of AstraZeneca. (Her purpose, in part, was to allay public concerns over the propensity of AstraZeneca to cause blood clots.)\n\nNot allowed to ask.\n\nFormer England and Manchester City player Trevor Sinclair has been criticized online after asking if the recent collapse of a professional footballer may have been linked to the Covid vaccine.Sinclair won 12 caps for England and is remembered for a 14-year stint in the Premier League that began at his most associated club, Queens Park Rangers. Now acting as a pundit in his post-playing days, he made controversial remarks on popular UK radio station TalkSport. On Tuesday, Scottish Sheffield United star John Fleck was rushed to hospital after a scare in his team\u2019s 1-0 victory over Reading. The following evening, in a Champions League clash against Real Madrid, Sheriff Tiraspol\u2019s winger Adama Traore went to the turf clutching his chest and had to be helped off the pitch by medical staff. Elsewhere, Barcelona\u2019s Sergio Aguero is tipped to retire after a heart incident earlier this month, while Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen suffered a high-profile incident at the European Championships in the summer. But even though there has been no evidence that these occurrences were connected to the Covid vaccine, Sinclair seemingly suggested a link. \u201cI think everyone wants to know if he has had the Covid vaccine,\u201d the 48-year-old began on Fleck. Later on Twitter, he also added: \u201cEveryone I speak to about these heart problems suffered by footballers (which worryingly seem to be happening more regularly) are they linked to Covid vaccines or not??\u201d. Sinclair was widely-attacked for the comments. \u201cThis is an inappropriate place to ask that question,\u201d Sinclair was informed.\u201dYou are begging for conspiracy theories. Ask a doctor. Ask a medical researcher. \u201cDo your own research online, being careful of the reliability of the sources. Everything I\u2019ve read says NO.\u201d \u201cPretty irresponsible stuff to post, Trevor,\u201d said another do-gooder.\u201dIf vaccines had anything to do with this, then surely millions of us would be having new heart problems every day all over the world. And we\u2019re not.\u201d\u201dEh, so you came up with an idea and are now asking people on social media if your imagination is reality,\u201d was another criticism.But not everyone jumped on the bandwagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t know Trevor as TalkSport cut you off when you asked,\u201d came one reply to his Twitter post. \u201cFair play to you for having the balls to ask the question. \u201cYes Trevor, don\u2019t ask questions or think for yourself ever again,\u201d it was suggested in support, after another user told him to think before he tweets.\u201dAll these comments are trying to be politically correct, grow a pair and say it how it is,\u201d demanded another outspoken voice. \u201cOne major side effect of the vaccine is inflammation of the heart. Yet we\u2019re supposed to think these sudden cases are a coincidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRestrictions on freedoms can be justified only if they are reasonably necessary to preserve what makes human life worth living, because freedom is a necessary condition of a life worth living and, therefore, worth preserving.\u201d\n\nArguments in favour of mandatory universal vaccination rely on the premise that everyone who can be vaccinated has a moral obligation to do so for the sake of those who cannot be vaccinated due to age or certain immune system disorders, or because the public health benefits of universal vaccination are so profound that to refuse vaccination would be unethical. This line of reasoning underpins the \u2018obligation to vaccinate\u2019 (OTV) range of arguments. Brennan1 formulates a broadly representative OTV-type argument in terms of an \u2018enforceable moral principle that prohibits people from participating in the collective imposition of unjust harm or risk of harm\u2019. Brennan begins by positing that (A) certain vaccines have a low incidence of side effect and are effective at preventing serious illness; (B) it would be a disaster if a large majority of individuals failed to receive various vaccines; (C) individual freedoms can be overridden to prevent a disaster; therefore, (D) \u2018it is permissible to force individuals to receive certain vaccines against dangerous illnesses\u2019. The argument seems to imply that non-vaccination is a sufficient condition of a disaster (would make the disaster imminent) that mandating mass vaccination is a sufficient condition of preventing the disaster, and that the overriding of individual freedoms could not result in a disaster of a different kind. None of these conditions can be assumed to be true. We could also infer from the above premises that anything conceived of as harm could be classified as a \u2018disaster\u2019 and this would automatically give someone a legitimate right to override the freedoms of others, but this is absurd. We must, therefore, conclude that C is false: individual freedoms cannot be overridden just to prevent a disaster. Restrictions on freedoms can be justified only if they are reasonably necessary to preserve what makes human life worth living, because freedom is a necessary condition of a life worth living and, therefore, worth preserving. This is a conceptually appealing formula, but since the criterion of reasonable necessity is as elastic as the notion of disaster, it does not tell us much about practical moral obligations. Brennan sidesteps this problem by proceeding to hone an OTV-type argument just in virtue of preventing \u2018the collective imposition of unjust harm or risk of harm\u2019. The reference to unjust harm makes his moral premise intuitively true but also compels us to identify the underlying injustice. Given that the existing vaccination technology is not risk-free (even if serious adverse reactions are rare) the alleged moral OTV implies that we have an obligation to reduce the risk to the health of others by accepting an increased or unknown health risk to ourselves. If I must accept an increased risk to myself in order to reduce the risk to others, because everyone has a moral obligation to do so, then justice demands that others must also accept an increased risk to themselves in order to reduce the risk to me, therefore, contradiction. This impasse can be resolved only by taking into account what set of \u2018risk-permitting rules would tend to benefit everyone as individuals\u20191; a crucial question to which I will return.\n\nVery little is known, which is a great reason to panic.\n\u2022 WHO Calls Special Meeting To Discuss New Covid Variant (CNBC)\n\nThe World Health Organization is monitoring a new variant with numerous mutations to the spike protein, scheduling a special meeting Friday to discuss what it may mean for vaccines and treatments, officials said Thursday. The variant, called B.1.1.529, has been detected in South Africa in small numbers, according to the WHO. \u201cWe don\u2019t know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations. And the concern is that when you have so many mutations, it can have an impact on how the virus behaves,\u201d Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, said in a Q&A that was livestreamed on the organization\u2019s social media channels. The monitoring of the new variant comes as Covid cases surge around the world heading into the holiday season, with the WHO reporting hot spots in all regions and particularly in Europe. South African scientists have detected more than 30 mutations to the spike protein, the part of the virus that binds to cells in the body, South African scientist Tulio de Oliveira said in a media briefing hosted by the South Africa Department of Health on Thursday. The B.1.1.529 variant contains multiple mutations associated with increased antibody resistance, which may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, along with mutations that generally make it more contagious, according to slides he presented at the briefing. Other mutations in the new variant haven\u2019t been seen until now, so scientists don\u2019t yet know whether they are significant or will change how the virus behaves, according to the presentation. The variant has spread rapidly through the Gauteng province, which contains the country\u2019s largest city of Johannesburg. \u201cEspecially when the spike happens in Gauteng, everybody travels in and out of Gauteng from all corners of South Africa. So it\u2019s a given that in the next few days, the beginning of rising positivity rate and numbers is going to be happening. It\u2019s a matter of days and weeks before we see that,\u201d South Africa Minister of Health Joe Phaahla said during the briefing. The variant has also been detected in Botswana and Hong Kong, Phaahla said. \u201cRight now, researchers are getting together to understand where these mutations are in the spike protein and the furin cleavage site, and what that potentially may mean for our diagnostics or therapeutics and our vaccines,\u201d Van Kerkhove said. She said there are fewer than 100 full genome sequences of the new mutation.\n\nNot could, will. Just try.\n\u2022 Former WHO Director Warns Making Vaccines Mandatory Could Cause Riots (SN)\n\nWarped \u201clogic\u201d: immune systems must fight off the vaccine.\n\n\u201cChildren do have a robust immune system and I expect that they will mount a good immune response to the vaccine as well..\u201d\n\u2022 COVID-19 Vaccine For Babies And Toddlers Could Be Approved Early 2022 (CBC)\n\n\u201c..millions of households may need their own Thanksgiving bouncer..\u201d\n\nOn the eve of Thanksgiving, media outlets urged Americans to perform COVID tests and check the vaccination status of Thanksgiving dinner guests before allowing them into their homes.Yes, really. During a segment on CBS Mornings, psychologist Lisa Damour was asked how nervous Thanksgiving hosts should bring up the subject of vaccination status when welcoming friends and family. \u201cIt might be a difficult conversation before people step into your house to say, \u2018whoa, wait a minute, where\u2019s your card, what\u2019s your status?\u2019 before you walk into my home,\u201d the host of the show said. \u201cThis is tough because people are all over the map on this,\u201d responded Damour. \u201cThey\u2019re also all over the map with their risk tolerance. But the rapid tests have made this a lot easier. Whatever people\u2019s vaccination status is, we can actually confirm safety on the spot.\u201d \u201cIf the situation feels weird, maybe make it kind of fun,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd say, \u2018we\u2019re going to start with hors d\u2019oeuvres in the garage. You know, we\u2019ll have drinks, we\u2019ll do our rapid tests, and then come on in,\u2019 right?\u201d You can make it playful, make it fun, and then be able to enjoy the holiday because you\u2019re not worried about safety.\u201d Let\u2019s just take a moment to sympathize with people who are attending Thanksgiving dinner today at a relative\u2019s house who is so paranoid about a virus with a 99.9% survival rate, they want to perform medical tests on their own family members before letting them in. Good luck to those people. Meanwhile, Axios published an article suggesting that hosts should deploy \u201cThanksgiving bouncers\u201d to deal with people who fail to comply. \u201cNo one really wants this job, but millions of households may need their own Thanksgiving bouncer. The cover charge is a negative COVID test, done ahead of arrival or outside the front door,\u201d the article states. \u201cNormalizing rapid tests is a practical way to help extended families feel a little more normal around the holiday dinner table.\u201d The piece went on to encourage hosts to inform guests ahead of time that they will \u201cbe testing everyone at the door for their own safety.\u201d No thanks, think I\u2019ll be staying home this year.\n\n\u201cThe current system, under which countries are added and removed from a safe list, will be dropped, a change officials think offers more certainty.\u201d Huh?\n\u2022 EU Moves To Place Covid Booster Jabs At Heart Of Travel Rules (G.)\n\nPeople hoping to travel to the European Union next year will have to get a booster jab once their original Covid vaccines are more than nine months old, under new proposals from Brussels. On Thursday, the European Commission proposed a nine-month limit for vaccine validity that would apply for travel within and to the EU. If the plans are approved by EU ministers, from 10 January 2022 non-EU travellers will be required to show proof of an EU-approved booster jab once their original vaccine status is more than nine months old. Similarly, travellers between the member states would have to meet the same requirement to avoid Covid tests, quarantine and other restrictions. The Commission hopes to avoid a confusing mixture of rules across the 27 member states, as governments scramble to tighten restrictions on everyday life following a surge in coronavirus infections. The plans were unveiled on Thursday as the European Medicines Agency approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged five to 11, opening the way for governments to extend vaccination campaigns. The EU regulator recommended two injections three weeks apart in the upper arm for primary-school children, at one-third of the adult dose. The latest EU proposals prioritise vaccinated people, as Brussels moves to classify travellers according to individual health and vaccine status, rather than their country of departure. From 1 March 2022, EU member states would only permit entry to vaccinated, recovered or essential travellers, such as lorry drivers. The current system, under which countries are added and removed from a safe list, will be dropped, a change officials think offers more certainty. The recommendation to make booster jabs necessary after nine months for non-EU non-essential travellers is part scientific advice, part practical policy. Immunity wanes after six months, but EU officials added an extra three to allow governments to get booster-shot programmes up and running. The EU executive also wants to allow entry for travellers with non-EU approved vaccines that are recognised by the World Health Organization, such as China\u2019s Sinopharm and Sinovac and the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India. The EU has only approved four vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca (produced in Europe), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and Moderna. Most EU member states only permit entry to people with EU-approved vaccines. Under the new proposals, travellers to the EU with a WHO-approved vaccine that is not EU approved, could enter the EU, but would have to produce a negative Covid-test.\n\n\u201cHospitals cannot be allowed to become prisons where patients are denied rights they would otherwise have.\u201d\n\u2022 No, You Cuck. This Is How (Denninger)\n\n**** you Daniel. \u201cThe family of Sun Ng will definitely have a meaningful Thanksgiving this year thanks to an attorney, a judge, and a doctor who bucked the system and enabled him to get ivermectin when he was at death\u2019s doorstep. Imagine how many thousands of others are missing at this year\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner thanks to the satanic effort to block this lifesaving drug \u2013 both outpatient and for those close to death?\u201d It\u2019s not just Ivermectin. These *******s are filling people with Remdesivir, which I remind you failed three times previously, including in a clinical trial for Ebola, a virus that kills half of those who get it. Distribution of patients into that treatment arm was stopped because of safety problems; in other words it was killing people more than the virus itself did, so they stopped using it partway through. Today hospitals are being paid bounties \u2014 yes, actual bonuses \u2014 if they use this drug on all Covid-19 patients. So the answer isn\u2019t this: \u201cThere is an immediate need for every attorney general to do battle with these hospitals and every legislature to pass a law specifically barring hospitals from blocking any patient from seeking the use of an FDA-approved drug at the direction of a physician to treat COVID. Hospitals cannot be allowed to become prisons where patients are denied rights they would otherwise have.\u201d The way you stop it is simple: Charge the hospital administrators with felony manslaughter for each and every Covid-19 patient who dies and is either (1) denied medication they, their family or their physicians want to use OR (2) is given Remdesivir, which generates a rebuttable presumption that the drug killed them and not the virus. Said presumption can be rebutted by autopsy if and only if their kidneys and liver are not damaged, which is what the drug does. Charge the hospital administrators with felony manslaughter for everyone they kill this way and watch their tune change immediately. Oh, and people will stop dying of Covid-19 too. Until and unless you advocate and in fact demand that **** you Mr. Auschwitz.\n\nThe winter of excess deaths is coming. And nobody knows why.\n\nThe clinical trials of Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine found that the all-cause mortality rate of the vaccinated group was higher than that of the control group, months after the trials were launched, according to a recently released FDA report. According to the report, which was released by the US Food and Drug Administration to provide background information on its August 2021 decision to grant full approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine after offering limited emergency authorization of use in last December, six months after the vaccine\u2019s clinical trial began, the total number of deaths reported in the vaccinated group was nearly one-quarter higher than the number of deaths in the placebo group. The report emphasized that \u201cNone of the deaths were considered related to vaccination.\u201d Just under 22,000 participants were included in each group, with half receiving the coronavirus vaccine, and half receiving a saline solution injection. The initial results of the clinical trials suggested a high-level of efficacy for the vaccine in preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19, an in particular, serious illness from COVID \u2013 but lacked significant data on all-cause mortality, due to the short time-frame and small number of total deaths. A follow-up assessment of participants completed on March 13th of this year looked at the overall health outcomes of the trial participants, six months after they received either the COVID vaccine or the saline solution injection. While Pfizer in July released partial data on the outcomes from the six-month assessment ending March 13th, the new FDA report includes more comprehensive data, and shows a significantly higher number of all-cause fatalities among the vaccinated cohort. The Pfizer report in late July of this year showed effectively equal all-cause fatality rates between the vaccine and placebo cohorts six months after the tests were conducted, with 15 deaths among the nearly 22,000 vaccine recipients, versus 14 deaths among the nearly 22,000 placebo recipients. Most of the total 29 deaths in both groups were not related to the coronavirus; of the deaths in both groups, three fatalities were listed as being related to the virus; two in the placebo group and one in the vaccinated group. The FDA report, however, revealed a larger number of deaths by all causes in both groups, with 17 deaths among the control group and 21 in the vaccinated cohort.\n\n\u201cThe idea of rejecting an order, that\u2019s counter to Marine Corps culture.\u201d\n\nThe Marine Corps faces a defining moment leading up to its Monday deadline for all Marines to have received a coronavirus vaccine, with reports of a significant number who have refused the shot clashing with the service\u2019s meticulously crafted image as the military\u2019s most disciplined fighting force \u2013 and its most potent. Roughly 10,000 of its 186,000-strong active duty force are positioned to miss the deadline the Department of the Navy set for all Marines and sailors to become fully vaccinated, according to the latest data, representing the highest proportion of any of the military services potentially to violate direct orders from the chain of command. Even those who may have waited until the final weeks to begin the vaccination process will ultimately miss the deadline, which requires Marines to have completed the two-week vaccination process. The 38,000 Marine Corps reservists face a later deadline of Dec. 28. Marine Corps headquarters has so far declined to say how many have applied for or been granted exemptions \u2013 a bureaucratic process to accommodate religious, medical or administrative concerns that has taken on outsized relevance in the age of coronavirus vaccine skepticism \u2013 or how it will punish those who outright refuse to receive the shot. A spokesman says it continues to study the scope of the issue. But those with deep experience in the corps and its place in the wider military say it has already suffered from the initial refusals, with the potential for greater damage after next week. \u201cFor decades the Marine Corps has been about the expeditionary force and readiness. \u2018First to Fight,\u2019 \u2018Send the Marines\u2019 \u2013 all those slogans about how they have to be ready to go on a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d says David Lapan, a former Marine Corps officer and later a spokesman for the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThe Marine Corps prides itself on its discipline and following orders,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe idea of rejecting an order, that\u2019s counter to Marine Corps culture.\u201d The Navy, by comparison, facing the same deadlines neared 100 percent vaccination early this month \u2013 matching a trend it has maintained in recent months following the catastrophic fallout of outbreaks that sidelined Navy ships early in the pandemic. The Office of Management and Budget revealed Wednesday that 92 percent of the entire federal workforce \u2013 including the military \u2013 had been vaccinated, with 4 percent receiving exemptions. The mandate takes on a different meaning for the Defense Department, however, as it was issued as a formal order by each service member\u2019s chain of command.\n\n\u201c..
