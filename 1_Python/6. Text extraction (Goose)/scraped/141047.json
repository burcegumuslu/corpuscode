In a March 16, 2021 email, which was sent less than a month after Twitter joined the Virality Project, a Twitter employee described tracking \u201ccampaigns against vaccine passports,\u201d \u201cfear of mandatory immunizations,\u201d and \u201cmisuse of official reporting tools.\u201d\n\nNot only did the Virality Project flag truthful content but, according to Taibbi, it would flag posts based on audience reaction and whether the responses to the post were deemed to be \u201cdisinformation.\u201d\n\nThe Virality Project flagged a story about the death of an elderly black woman after receiving the Pfizer vaccine in Virginia because it \u201chas received attention in anti-vax groups\u201d and \u201cthe majority of top comments on the story are anti-vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe Virality Project also claimed that people who were just \u201casking questions\u201d were engaging in \u201ca tactic commonly used by spreaders of misinformation to deflect culpability\u201d and reportedly described a \u201cWorldwide Rally for Freedom planned over Telegram\u201d as a disinformation event.\n\nAnother technique the Virality Project used was to encourage Big Tech platforms to target people instead of posts using \u2014 something Taibbi described as \u201cMinority Report-style \u2018pre-crime\u2019 logic.\u201d\n\nThe Virality Project was previously called the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP) and under this previous name, it claimed to have successfully pushed for millions of tweets to be labeled in the run-up to the 2020 US presidential election.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-03-21 19:30:57", "title": "Twitter Files: US government helped launch project where millions of online posts were flagged for censorship", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-03-21-us-government-helped-online-posts-censorship.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "More evidence of the close censorship ties between Big Tech and government.
