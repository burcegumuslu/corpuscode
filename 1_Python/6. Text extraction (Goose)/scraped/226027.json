Germany\u2019s Health Minister Last Boosted 9 Months Ago!", "cleaned_text": "Germany\u2019s Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach claims in public he has been Covid vaccinated four times and urgently recommends everyone to follow his example.\n\nUnfortunately for Lauterbach, who recently struggled with a bout of the COVID infection himself, it appears he has been vaccinated only 3 times. His last shot was administered in November of last year!\n\nAccording to Germany\u2019s Berliner Zeitung here, \u201cA check of his digital vaccination certificates with the CovPassCheck app has now revealed that at least the last digitally noted vaccination took place more than 270 days ago, i.e. in mid-November 2021. It is noted as a \u2018booster vaccination.'\u201d\n\nDuring a press conference last Friday, the health minister unwittingly showed off his digital vaccination certificate on his mobile device, complete with QR code, before dozens of cameras. Like everyone else\u2019s certificates, it too can be checked with just a few clicks using CovPassCheck.\n\nOops, CovPassCheck showed his last vaccination was 271 days ago, long before the fourth vaccination was even in public discussion.\n\nThe Berliner Zeitung reports that journalist Janina Lionello wanted to know how long it had been since Lauterbach\u2019s last vaccination, \u201cbut the Federal Ministry of Health refuses to provide this information,\u201d she said, and quoted a ministry spokesman: \u201cPlease understand that we can\u2019t go into details about medical matters.\u201d\n\nUnder Lauterbach\u2019s plans for the future, regular citizens wouldn\u2019t have the luxury of such privacy, and would be denied access to a wide range of public venues.\n\nRecently the vaccine fanatic health minister even called for everyone getting a fourth shot, and to not wait for the new vaccines to arrive later this fall. Moreover, he sparked controversy when he suggested a booster every 3 months thereafter. Lauterbach told German ZDF television that \u201conly freshly vaccinated is well vaccinated.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to explain what was meant by freshly vaccinated, Lauterbach told ZDF: \u201cAccording to the definition we use here, it means three months. That means at least the third vaccination or another vaccination must be no more than three months ago. Then you have a good probability that the vaccinated person himself is well protected and not as much at risk of infection as someone who has been vaccinated longer ago. Or who has only had one vaccination.\u201d\n\nLater Lauterbach quickly backpedaled, insisting that a jab every three months would be nonsense.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Pandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Lauterbach-4.-impfung.png", "https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/laut-covpasscheck-karl-lauterbach-zuletzt-vor-271-tagen-geimpft-corona-li.255960", "https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/laut-covpasscheck-karl-lauterbach-zuletzt-vor-271-tagen-geimpft-corona-li.255960", "https://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/booster-imfpung-lauterbach-will-empfehlung-zu-vierter-impfung-fuer-jede-altersgruppe/28580742.html", "https://www.mdr.de/brisant/lauterbach-corona-122.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
