Some take longer than others to do it. We see you Ted. We *really* see you, now. Through fresh eyes.\n\nI wonder if Trump wants the DS to go all in on J6, he knows the truth, he caught them all and the J6 is falling apart.\n\nLets look at his statement\n\n1. He is drawing attention to Nancy Pelosi, she is coverup vital information between herself and the DOD, he is also stating that she deleted her emails. Remember nothing is every deleted.\n\n2. He is letting her and the [DS] know that he caught them all and the knows what they did and what they covered up. Is he suggesting that those deleted emails will be produced and if they are produced the J6 [FF] would be revealed.\n\n3. We are in an information war, timing is everything, when do you produce the information, when you have control of the bullhorn, will his new platform allow this to happen?\n\u2022 Fewer voters now trust the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and many believe the agency is acting as President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cpersonal Gestapo.\u201d\n\nHUGE! Georgia Ballot Trafficking Whistleblower Admits to Making $45,000 for Stuffing Ballot Boxes \u2014 Just One of 242 Traffickers \u2014 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of Ballots! (VIDEO)\n\u2022 The Georgia ballot trafficking whistleblower reportedly admitted to making $45,000 for stuffing Georgia ballot boxes from 2 to 5 AM in the morning. He was just one of 242 alleged ballot traffickers identified by the True the Vote investigation. There is a possibility of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of ballots that were stufffed into the ballot boxes in Georgia!\n\u2022 You can\u2019t ballot harvest in Georgia. What turned this around is that a whistleblower in Georgia came forward. On the tapes they identified 240 of the same people going around the state stuffing ballot drop boxes between 2 and 5 AM\u2026 where they were emptying backpacks out and they were dropping 50, 100 ballots into a dropbox. This is totally illegal\u2026 Here\u2019s the bottom line, right? The one whistleblower that came forward beause allegedly his mom said, hey what you\u2019re doing is wrong and you need to be honest about it. Own up to it. He said that he was paid $10 per ballot\u2026 And he made $45,000 between November 3rd and the runoff. Two elections he made $45,000!\u2026 Now do the math.\n\u2022 He said this was the average payout. There were 240 people of the same ones over and over in the same car involved in it. You start doing the math here. 45,000 time 240 people\u2026 You\u2019ve got $11 million dollars distributed illegally. Then you take 4500 ballots by 240 people. You\u2019re talking about a million ballots!\n\nRemember when D\u2019s and the FAKE NEWS media [+FAKEWOOD] pushed mass fear that POTUS would start WWIII re: North Korea?\n\n POTUS > PEACE on the Korean P > NO further missile tests or U enrichment.\n\n New narrative created.\n\n Refusal to provide coverage of successes.\n\n Remember when D\u2019s and the FAKE NEWS media [+FAKEWOOD] pushed a stock market collapse if POTUS was elected?\n\n POTUS E + policies > largest gains recorded in market\u2019s history\n\n New narrative created.\n\n Refusal to provide coverage of successes.\n\n [Use FED to inc rates to counter growth and project POTUS blame]\n\n Remember when D\u2019s and the FAKE NEWS media [+FAKEWOOD] pushed complete economic collapse if POTUS was elected?\n\n POTUS E + policies > lowest unemployment records in history + record jobs/GDP growth\n\n New narrative created.\n\n Refusal to provide coverage of successes.\n\n [Deploy and use \u2018racism\u2019 \u2018sexism\u2019 and every other \u2026.\u2019ism\u2019 to counter potential Black/Hispanic pop support]\n\n Why do D\u2019s and the FAKE NEWS media [+FAKEWOOD] continually push the \u2018IMPEACH\u2019 narrative if impeachment requires 2/3rd SENATE VOTE TO ENACT (odds of that?)?\n\n Do they push this FAKE NARRATIVE to project a supposed \u2018supportable w/ evidence\u2019 wrongdoing to their BASE (confirmation bias)?\n\n Accusations never supported by facts?\n\n Group-Think.\n\n The list goes on and on\u2026..\n\n PANIC IN DC?\n\n WHY?\n\n WHAT WAS LOST?\n\n POWER OF THE PURSE.\n\n COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY.\n\n POWER TO REPLACE SENIOR OFFICIALS WITHIN CRUCIAL GOV POSITIONS (DEPT\u2019S) WHO CAN THEN REPLACE SR+MID+LOW POSITIONS (TRICKLE_DOWN REPLACEMENT).\n\n POWER TO APPOINT SC JUSTICES.\n\n (What if HRC won and appointed 2+ crooked SCJs?)\n\n (The Last Resort)\n\n POWER TO DIRECTLY UNDO HUSSEIN/PREV EO\u2019S WHICH HARMED-GREATLY LIMITED THE US IN MANY VITAL/NEC WAYS.\n\n POWER TO REBUILD THE UNITED STATES MILITARY (BACK) TO A GLOBAL SUPER POWER.\n\n (CHINA PAYOFFS (BRIBE $) FAILURE)\n\n POWER TO ENACT LAWS BY EO TO COMBAT AND PROTECT OUR PEOPLE.\n\n POWER TO SHIFT FOREIGN POLICY THEREBY REDUCING OUR ENEMIES ABILITY TO PROSPER AND SOMEDAY REIGN.\n\n (IRAN DEAL \u2013 PARIS ACCORD \u2013 CHINA TRADE \u2013 SYRIA \u2013 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.)\n\n POWER TO DECLAS CRUCIAL DOCS TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC W/ THE TRUTH (TRANSPARENCY).\n\n POWER TO GIVE BACK POWER TO THE PEOPLE (AS INTENDED BY OUR FOUNDERS).\n\n LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.\n\n \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n Q", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Buckle up, everyone.</p>\n<p>In just a few months, the entire narrative of January 6 will collapse amid the release of secret surveillance video, FBI interviews/documents, and the feds most bogus charge, obstruction of an official proceeding.</p>\n<p>You heard it here first \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8</p>\n<p>\u2014 Julie Kelly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@julie_kelly2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/julie_kelly2/status/1466133363710902272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Did Wray\u2019s FBI assets identify themselves with orange (get it?) neon caps and electrical tape?</p>\n<p>These folks are missing from FBI most wanted list and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeditionHunters?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SeditionHunters</a> target list.
