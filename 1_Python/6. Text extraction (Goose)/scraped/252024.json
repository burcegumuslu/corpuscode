Rand Paul, a practicing physician, is urging Americans to throw away their face masks and burn vaccine passports.\n\n\u201cThe left has gone completely COVID crazy,\u201d the Kentucky Republican says in a new fundraising pitch.\n\n\u201cThey want government-enforced shutdowns, mask mandates, school closures, forced vaccines, and now they\u2019re talking about a COVID vaccine passport. It\u2019s absolutely unconstitutional \u2013 not to mention, it\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nThroughout the COVID crisis, these radicals have embraced theatrics, abandoned science, and the longer it goes on, the more they double down.\n\nThe newest power grab comes in the form of an alleged \u201cVaccine Passport\u201d which would determine whether or not you\u2019re \u201cALLOWED\u201d to engage in your everyday life.\n\nWant to go to the store? Show your vaccine card.\n\nWant to go to a restaurant or concert? Did you tell the government what vaccines you\u2019ve had?\n\nWant to travel? VACCINE PAPERS PLEASE.\n\nThis is the slippery slope I warned about and it\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m fighting to defeat in Washington. \u2026\n\n\u2026 this passport idea from these hypocrites in Washington is just completely unacceptable.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget: these are the same people who are boycotting states like Georgia for implementing common-sense policies like voter ID.\n\nLet me tell you something \u2026 if you think voter ID is racist, but the vaccine passport is just fine, you need some serious help thinking through public policy.\n\nI will never be in favor of this COVID hysteria and I will never support a COVID passport.\n\nIt\u2019s time to say enough is enough.\n\nI urge everyone to get the vaccine if you need or want it. And then I urge everyone in America to throw away their masks, demand their schools be open, and burn your vaccine passport if they try to give it to you.\n\nLast month, as WND reported, Paul blasted presidential COVID adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, asking him what scientific studies he could cite that indicated people who have had the infection or a vaccine will spread the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not spreading the infection, isn\u2019t it just theater? You\u2019ve had the vaccine and you wearing two masks, isn\u2019t that just theater?\u201d the senator asked.\n\n\u201cNo. Here we go again with the theater. Let\u2019s get down to the facts,\u201d Fauci responded.\n\nPaul also portrayed Fauci as a wannabe philosopher who spins \u201cnoble lies.\u201d\n\nHe told Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham: \u201cYou have to remember that his lies are noble lies, Laura. He\u2019s not telling you this because he\u2019s a mean man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling you this because he feels sorry for you because you don\u2019t understand, and Americans aren\u2019t smart enough to make an informed decision. So, he fashions himself some sort of Greek philosopher. He tells you these noble lies.\u201d\n\nRead more at: WND.com and Deception.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u2018Throw away your masks and burn your vaccine passport\u2019: Rand Paul", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2021-04-19-throw-away-your-masks-and-vaccine-passport.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "U.S. Sen.
