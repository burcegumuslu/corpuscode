(An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines to help create a stronger immune response in people who receive the vaccine.)\n\nHow effective is the plant-based COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nOverall, the vaccine had a 75.3% efficacy against people developing COVID-19 with the Delta variant, which is the dominant variant circulating right now. While that\u2019s lower than the 94% to 95% efficacy offered by the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, Medicago points out in a press release that those efficacy levels were determined when the original SARS-CoV-2 was circulating, \u201cmaking direct comparisons impossible.\u201d\n\nResearchers also found that the overall vaccine efficacy rate against all SARS-CoV-2 variants was 71%, and went up to 75.6% in people who had no previous exposure to COVID-19. Efficacy was also 88.6% against the Gamma variant. The Omicron variant wasn\u2019t circulating during the study.\n\nDuring the study period, only a small number of severe COVID-19 cases occurred and none were in the vaccinated group.\n\nThe researchers also found that there were no serious side effects and, when people had symptoms from the vaccine, they only lasted between one and three days. Full results of the study will be released in a peer-reviewed journal \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d the press release says, noting that the company is seeking regulatory approval from Health Canada to get its vaccine out to the masses.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredible moment for Medicago and for novel vaccine platforms. The results of our clinical trials show the power of plant-based vaccine manufacturing technology,\u201d Takashi Nagao, CEO and president at Medicago, said in a statement. \u201cIf approved, we will be contributing to the world\u2019s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with the world\u2019s first plant-based vaccine for use in humans.\u201d\n\nOK, but what even is a vaccine from plants? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nHow is the Medicago plant-based COVID vaccine created?\n\nMedicago hasn\u2019t revealed its exact formula, but the company shared that it has been developing its plant-based technology for the past 20 years. It involves producing virus-like particles (VLPs) for its protein vaccines. \u201cVLPs are designed to mimic the native structure of viruses, allowing them to be easily recognized by the immune system,\u201d Medicago explains.\n\nThe VLPs don\u2019t have core genetic material, making them non-infectious and unable to replicate\u2014meaning, they can't give you COVID-19. Once the code for COVID-19 is added to the vaccine, it\u2019s purified and then mixed with an adjuvant for the finished product, explains Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nWhat are the perks of having a plant-based vaccine?\n\nThere are a few. \u201cThis has the potential to be less expensive to make and potentially be adopted by countries in parts of the world that don\u2019t have vaccine capabilities now,\u201d Dr. Russo says. The VLPs are also reportedly more stable than the mRNA and adenovirus vaccines, which could help minimize cold storage issues, he says.\n\nPlant-based vaccines may also be more appealing to people who don\u2019t want to get other vaccines over religious concerns or worries that they\u2019re not \u201cnatural\u201d enough, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cHaving multiple vaccines using multiple different technologies makes it less tenable for people to shun all vaccines,\u201d he says. Dr. Russo agrees. \"Image and perception is everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIf people didn't want to put the other vaccines in their arms but will use this because it's \u2018natural,\u2019 then hallelujah.\u201d\n\nDr. Adalja points out that plant-based vaccines have been in development \u201cfor some time,\u201d adding, \u201cit may prove to be an important platform to manufacture this and other vaccines.\u201d\n\nWhat are the cons of the Medicago plant-based COVID vaccine?\n\nThe efficacy isn\u2019t great, Dr. Russo says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he says. \u201cI would have liked to have seen higher.\u201d But, he points out, it\u2019s still better than Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 66.3% efficacy, which was enough to get it authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nDr. Russo says that the news is \u201cexciting.\u201d But, he says, \u201cis it going to take center stage for COVID vaccines? Not yet. But it may prove to be an important alternative platform in the future.\u201d", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "Everything You Need to Know About the Plant-Based COVID-19 Vaccine That Shows \u2018Positive Efficacy\u2019", "description": "Yup, it's for real\u2014and so far it has higher efficacy than the J&J vaccine.", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/doctor-making-a-vaccination-in-the-shoulder-of-royalty-free-image-1638982979.jpg?crop=1xw:0.74965xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "600", "url": "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a38462364/medicago-plant-based-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy/", "article:section": "Health Conditions", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-09T13:01:17Z", "article:published_time": "2021-12-09T13:00:00Z", "types": ["article", "website"]}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.prevention.com/health/a35418316/alcohol-after-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://medicago.com/en/press-release/medicago-and-gsk-announce-positive-phase-3-efficacy-and-safety-results-for-adjuvanted-plant-based-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a35002158/pfizer-vs-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-ingredients/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a37200110/how-contagious-is-delta-variant-covid-19/", "https://medicago.com/en/press-release/medicago-and-gsk-announce-positive-phase-3-efficacy-and-safety-results-for-adjuvanted-plant-based-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/", "/health/health-conditions/a38440170/covid-19-mix-and-match-booster-shots/", "/health/health-conditions/a38461092/omicron-covid-variant-vaccine-booster-efficacy/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a37545312/biden-vaccine-mandate/", "https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a31077033/what-is-plant-based-diet/", "https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a34989924/covid-19-vaccine-storage-temperatures/", "https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html", "/author/216238/korin-miller/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-12-09T13:00:00Z"}
