To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about the emergence of other deadly coronavirus outbreaks like SARS and MERS. How were we able to get them under control?\n\nMERS could be stopped because of its relatively low \u201cbasic reproduction number,\u201d abbreviated as R with a little subscript zero. (That\u2019s the R naught you may have heard about.) The reason they call it the reproduction number is because the concept goes back to the study of human population growth, like the number of daughters, on average, each woman had. But in infectious disease, it represents the number of people a single infected individual is expected to pass the disease along to in a susceptible population, so R is a measure of how contagious a new pathogen is.\n\nFor the MERS coronavirus\u2013\u2013the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus\u2013\u2013the R was only about 1; so, each MERS patient tended to transmit the disease to only one other person. You can imagine how much easier a disease like that can be stopped, compared to a virus with the potential to spread exponentially\u2014viruses like the SARS or COVID-19 coronaviruses, with an R of 2 or greater.\n\nIn the case of a virus with an R of 2, for example, unless stopped, one infected person could become two, then four, then eight, and so on.\n\nThe coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may indeed be able to latch onto receptors in the human respiratory tract better than the coronavirus that causes SARS, and also replicate better in the upper airways than SARS. But the primary reason there were more COVID-19 cases in the first month after it was reported than SARS ever did revolves less around how contagious it is, and more around when it is contagious.\n\nThe three characteristics of microbes most likely to cause pandemics are: novelty, a new pathogen, so there\u2019s no pre-existing immunity; respiratory spread (I mean pneumonia is humanity\u2019s fourth leading killer, even outside a pandemic); and the third characteristic for optimal pandemic potential is transmission before symptom onset.\n\nThe last four pandemics of respiratory disease were caused by new flu viruses, originating from bird flu and swine flu viruses, each of which fit all three of those criteria. SARS, however, was not considered a pandemic, despite spreading to twenty-nine countries and regions. Why did the World Health Organization (WHO) only consider SARS a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern,\u201d and how were we able to stop it within just a few months at only around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths? It was a brand new virus, spread via respiratory droplets, but SARS lacked the third necessary characteristic: significant spread before symptoms arise.\n\nFor SARS, the average incubation period\u2014the time between first becoming unwittingly infected after exposure to the virus, and first coming down with symptoms\u2014was around five days, similar to COVID-19. But it took another six to eleven days, however, for SARS viral loads to fully ramp up in upper respiratory tract secretions coughed or sneezed from one person to the next. So, even after falling ill, patients with SARS weren\u2019t very infectious in the first five days or so of the illness. Since viral loads peaked about ten days after people started feeling sick, after they knew they had it, you can see how human-to-human transmission could be stopped if patients could be isolated within the first few days after the onset of symptoms. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. A massive international effort spearheaded by the WHO was able to identify all of the cases by their symptoms, isolate the patients, and trace all their contacts. That\u2019s how we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox from the planet too, (with a vaccine) in the same way. Smallpox was also only contagious after you knew who had it.\n\nSo, fever screening at airports helped stop the global spread of SARS in its tracks. You didn\u2019t become particularly infectious until after symptoms started\u2014and, 100 percent of SARS patients developed a fever. In a way, SARS was a disease designed to be stopped. With MERS, 98 percent of the patients became febrile (meaning have a fever). In the case of COVID-19, though, as many as 36 percent\u2014more than one in three\u2014do not present with fever, a nice objective symptom, at the onset of symptoms. And, more seriously, patients may be infectious during the incubation period without any symptoms at all.\n\nIn fact, the viral load in an asymptomatic patient with COVID-19 was found to be similar to that of symptomatic patients, with as many as 15 million viral copies within every quarter teaspoon of snot. Same amount of virus in symptomatic snot\u2014taken from someone who\u2019s just turned sick\u2014compared to asymptomatic snot. Spewing just as much virus right before you get sick.\n\nWith COVID-19, you can feel perfectly fine, no symptoms at all, but actually have the disease and spread the disease before the first cough\u2013\u2013before you get a fever or any symptoms. It\u2019s the same thing with the flu. That\u2019s how new flu viruses can trigger pandemics, too. Like the flu, you can potentially spread COVID-19 before you know you have it, even while you\u2019re feeling perfectly fine. That\u2019s a disease that\u2019s hard to stop. To slow the spread of that kind of disease, where you don\u2019t know who\u2019s infectious and who\u2019s not, you have to try isolating everyone. That\u2019s where social distancing measures are required.\n\nPlease consider volunteering to help out on the site.", "opengraph": {"video": "http://youtube.com/v/gxiTR_lTts0", "video:type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "video:duration": "400", "video:width": "640", "video:height": "360", "locale": "en_US", "title": "R0 and Incubation Periods: How Other Coronavirus Outbreaks Were Stopped | NutritionFacts.org", "description": "Why can\u2019t we stop COVID-19 like we stopped SARS and MERS, the other two 21st century coronavirus outbreaks?", "url": "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/r0-and-incubation-periods-how-other-coronavirus-outbreaks-were-stopped/", "image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/themes/sage/dist/images/default-image.png", "type": "video.other", "twitter:player": "http://youtube.com/v/gxiTR_lTts0"}, "tags": ["respiratory infections", "zoonotic disease", "COVID-19", "fever", "World Health Organization", "pandemics", "China", "lung health", "Asia", "coronavirus", "viral infections", "Volume 50Cov"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://nutritionfacts.org/volunteer"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "June 15, 2020"}
