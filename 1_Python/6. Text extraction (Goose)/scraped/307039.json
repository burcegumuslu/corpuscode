The vaccine is \u201cpart of a new government partnership to fast-track development of the same mrna technology behind the most successful coronavirus vaccines as companies race to build upon pandemic successes and target other diseases.\u201d Trials will start in September.\n\nAdvancing \u201cscience\u201d: By producing and injecting billions of mrna covid vaccine doses, Pfizer and BioNTech have gained important data and funding for the next frontier. But the so-called \u201cpandemic successes\u201d did not come without side effects and deaths. (Read \u201cSudden Deaths Skyrocket as White House Pushes Untested Drugs,\u201d by Stephen Flurry.)\n\nThe funds: The funding for this next project is also suspicious. Since 2020, the European Union has ordered 4.2 billion vaccine doses for a population of fewer than 450 million\u2014enough to vaccinate almost every citizen 10 times. The vast majority, however, had enough after the second and third shot. Due to the contracts, the EU government must keep paying for the overpriced doses. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has refused to publish text messages with Pfizer ceo Albert Bourla that preceded the largest order: \u20ac35 billion covering 1.8 billion doses.\n\nThe experiment continues: The dubious way BioNTech is getting the money and scientific data puts this latest apparent success in a different light. Our April 2022 Trumpet issue \u201cRunning on \u2018COVID Money\u2019\u201d covers this topic in detail.
