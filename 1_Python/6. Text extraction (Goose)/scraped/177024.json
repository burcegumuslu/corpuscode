The discovery could remove the need for frequent booster immunizations.\n\nDr. Natalia Freund, along with doctoral students Michael Mor and Ruofan Lee from the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at TAU, led the study. Dr. Ben Croker of the University of California, San Diego, collaborated on it. Professor Ye Xiang of Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University, Professor Meital Gal-Tanamy and Dr. Moshe Dessau of Bar-Ilan University were also involved in the research.\n\nThe findings were reported in the journal Nature Communications Biology.\n\nFreund and her colleagues sequenced all B immune system cells from the blood of those who recovered from the original COVID strain in Israel and discovered nine antibodies produced by patients. In addition, the researchers learned that some of these antibodies are highly effective at neutralizing the coronavirus subtypes Delta and Omicron.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Covid vaccines no longer needed thanks to new natural Israeli antibody treatment", "description": "Researchers have declared this a scientific breakthrough.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/354953/covid-vaccines-no-longer-needed-thanks-to-new-natural-israeli-antibody-treatment/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2022-09-08T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/F200326OF47-1.jpg", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Medical/Science", "noads"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["JNS"], "publish_date": "2022-09-08T00:00:00+00:00"}
