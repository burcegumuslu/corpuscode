Many politicians, including Joe Biden, sold the initial two-dose vaccine as one that would grant immunity to the virus. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,\u201d then-candidate Biden said during a CNN town hall in July of 2020. Biden and other high-profile Democrats have walked back those claims after breakthrough case rates skyrocketed last year.\n\n\u201cRight now, the protection that you\u2019re getting from the third [dose], it is good enough \u2014 actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 it\u2019s not that good against infections, but doesn\u2019t last very long,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nThe Pfizer CEO went on to claim that the Omicron variant is the first variant that was able to \u201cevade\u201d their vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci repeatedly claimed that a third booster injection would offer protection against future variants when the shots were beginning to roll out last December.\n\nDespite Omicron producing far fewer hospitalizations and deaths than previous variants, with an overwhelming majority of patients recording mild symptoms, Bourla is still encouraging people to get a fourth dose in order to avoid getting sick.\n\nBourla said the company is working on a vaccine that will \u201coffer protection\u201d against future variants. \u201cWhat we are trying to do and we are working very diligently right now it is to make not only a vaccine that will protect against all variants, including Omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Fauci Weighs in on Ukraine, Says War Will \u2018Interrupt the Vaccine Programs of Kids\u2019", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer CEO Says Fourth Vaccine Dose is Necessary Due to Waning Immunity", "description": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said people will need a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose due to \u201cwaning\u201d immunity. \u201cIt is necessary for most.\"", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/pfizer-ceo-says-fourth-vaccine-dose-necessary-due-waning-immunity/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-03-14T20:06:16+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-14T20:10:12+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pfizer-vax.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Dr. Anthony Fauci", "Joe Biden", "Pfizer", "COVID-19"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nypost.com/2022/03/13/pfizer-ceo-fourth-covid-shot-necessary-due-to-waning-immunity/", "https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2021/07/22/biden-claims-you-cant-get-covid-after-vaccine-n2592934", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/fauci-says-booster-shots-likely-give-cross-protection-against-wide-range-of-covid-variants.html", "https://nationalfile.com/fauci-weighs-ukraine-says-war-will-interrupt-vaccine-programs-kids/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/dr-anthony-fauci/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/joe-biden/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/pfizer/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-03-14T20:06:16+00:00"}
