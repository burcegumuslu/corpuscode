Bocavirus is a recently discovered viral genus found in upper respiratory secretions from children hospitalized with pneumonia or diarrhea-like symptoms.\n\nThere is no vaccine available for bocavirus, nor diagnostic tests or medical treatments.\n\nBocavirus is commonly only found in infants and children (sometimes in young adults) with respiratory infections or diarrhea. The following are the signs and symptoms associated with bocavirus:\n\u2022 Cyanosis (bluish or grayish tint to skin due to lack of oxygen)\n\nThe infants and children with these symptoms are often already ill and hospitalized. The immune systems of infants, young children and older adults tend to be weaker and more susceptible to viruses. Children are especially more prone due to their constant contact with other kids. They often rub their eyes and put their fingers in their mouths without washing their hands, which can easily spread any virus or bacteria.\n\nEssentially, anyone with a weakened immune system is at risk. People with heart disease or other lung problems are more likely to contract an acute respiratory infection. Smoking puts a person at high risk; plus, smokers have more trouble recovering.\n\nBocavirus infections most often affect children with pneumonia, a respiratory condition. Untreated infections could lead to lung disease. Lung disease refers to many disorders affecting the lungs and breathing, such as asthma, the flu, pneumonia and tuberculosis, lung cancer, and many other respiratory problems. Some lung diseases can lead to respiratory failure.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent human bocavirus infection\n\nVitamins A, C, and E, as well as folate and zinc, all support respiratory health.\n\nAvoid foods that weaken the immune system, such as refined and processed products, dairy and high-fat products, added sugar and sugary foods, and alcohol.\n\nHere are some ways to cleanse and detox your lungs.\n\u2022 Deep breathing \u2014 Deep breathing can help improve lung capacity and strengthen your lungs, as well as clear the airways and cleanse them.\n\u2022 Oregano \u2014 Oregano contains compounds like carvacrol and terpenes that have lung-cleansing action. The herb can help reduce inflammation and congestion in the lungs, and improve nasal passage airflow and overall health of your respiratory tract.\n\u2022 Licorice \u2014 The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of licorice help reduce inflammation of the bronchial tubes. It also has antibacterial and antiviral activity that help prevent and treat mild lung infections and irritation.\n\u2022 Ginger \u2014 Ginger contains compounds that help clear out air pollutants from the air passages before they irritate the lungs. Studies have explored the promising chemo-preventive effects of ginger extracts against lung cancer.\n\u2022 Peppermint \u2014 Peppermint and its essential oil contain menthol that helps relax the smooth muscles of the respiratory tract. This promotes effortless breathing and helps clear symptoms of any upper respiratory congestion.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 The 3 Days Mantra To Purify Your Lungs\n\u2022 8 Plants and Herbs That Drain Lungs Toxin, Heal Respiratory Infections And Improve Pulmonary Function\n\u2022 Are your lungs charbroiled?
