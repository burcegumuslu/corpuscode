It shows that the gene-editing injections cause \u201cneurodegenerative disease, myocarditis, Bell\u2019s palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response and tumorigenesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system,\u201d Carlson, who never got injected for covid, explained during his segment.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope that\u2019s not true. But it\u2019s not just the conclusion of one scientific journal.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that another study published in The Lancet found that the risk of infection, hospitalization and death following the second dose of a covid injection lasts for at least nine months.\n\nBongino urged his viewers to rethink everything they were told about the plandemic, especially if they bought into the \u201cstate of emergency\u201d rhetoric that drove the push towards mass vaccination.\n\n\u201cFolks, science is patient,\u201d Bongino said. \u201cScience is chronological. Science is the repeating and replicating of data through process, through control groups. Science is the elimination of confounding variables.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll these things take time. Whereas, I understand we were in an emergency situation due to COVD \u2013 no emergency situation should lead a company or a government to force people to take something, to force them to take something, that may in the long-run damage their body.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about covid injections can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Dan Bongino says getting vaccinated for covid is his biggest regret in life", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.health.news/2022-08-26-dan-bongino-getting-covid-vaccine-biggest-regret.html", "site_name": "Health News", "description": "Conservative radio host Dan Bongino has confessed that he deeply regrets ever getting \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).
