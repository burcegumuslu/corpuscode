Due to Recent 'Anti-Vaccine' Comments", "cleaned_text": "MENLO PARK, CA\u2014Explaining that the World Health Organization (WHO) had violated the site\u2019s content guidelines, Facebook reportedly banned the WHO from posting on Facebook in a crackdown on \u201cdangerous\u201d accounts.\n\nIn December 2019, the WHO held the Global Vaccine Safety Summit in Geneva, Switzerland. After the meeting, several WHO scientists posted their comments to the WHO\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nHere are several of the offending quotes that were later posted on Facebook and resulted in the ban:\n\u2022 Prof. Heidi Larson, Ph.D. (Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project) admitted that the WHO lacks vaccine safety science and needs \u201cmuch more investment in safety science.\u201d\n\u2022 Prof. Larson stated \u201cWe have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to question vaccines\u201d and also mentioned that doctors aren\u2019t confident enough to answer safety questions from parents since they only got a half day of vaccine education in medical school.\n\u2022 Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, M.D. (Chief Scientist, WHO) stated \u201cWe really don\u2019t have very good safety monitoring systems.\u201d\n\u2022 Most alarming was when Dr. Marion Gruber, Ph.D. (Director, Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA) said that we should start to consider \u201csafety concerns\u201d regarding vaccines which are already being injected into people all over the world.\n\nWe cannot have scientists from the W.H.O. questioning vaccine safety. These are the people who make vaccine policy for the entire world. If they continue to question, then the people will continue to question. Pretty soon, nobody will take vaccines. It\u2019ll be anarchy! I could lose my condo in Manhattan and my yacht in the Caribbean!\u201d\n\nConceding that Facebook users who call more vaccine safety studies might have a case, Facebook representatives told reporters Thursday that classifying \u201canti-vaccine\u201d sentiment can be difficult because some posts actually make very interesting points, especially when the posts are from scientists at the World Health Organization.\n\nNevertheless, in the words of Jenny Manilow, head of global policy management at Facebook:\n\nThe Facebook community should be a \u2018safe space\u2019 where our users are protected from having to think logically about vaccines and should not have to be confronted with any Facebook users who question the safety of vaccines. This is why we\u2019ve suspended the account of the World Health Organization.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Zuckerberg, in what banking experts are calling an \u201cunprecedented liquidation,\u201d he announced last week that, following a swift drop in the value of his Facebook stock holdings, he had no choice but to \u201csell off\u201d 1.5 million Facebook users. In the most viewed \u201cFacebook live\u201d in history, the men, women, and children (ages 11 and up) were auctioned off to a Los Angeles-based private equity group.\n\nYes, just in case you\u2019re missed \u201cSATIRE\u201d \u2026 TWICE \u2026 as well as the words \u201cFAKE NEWS\u201d on the photo \u2026 this is .
