Instead of having a virus \"fizzle out\" ADE allows it to continue to thrive even though natural immunity would have eradicated it already. According to Bossche: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n It is undeniable that mass vaccination will only drive the virus to fully exploit its evolutionary capacity, including \u2013 if needed \u2013 its ability to use alternate receptor domains on permissive cells. The fitness cost that may come with such a dramatic mutation is likely to be rewarded with enhanced pathogenicity. I am truly afraid that these dynamics will eventually allow for the natural selection of individuals with uncompromised innate immunity while eliminating those without it. While such natural selection would lead to an eradication of SARS-CoV-2 as innate immunity sterilizes the virus and blocks transmission, the consequences would be unimaginable \u2013 the price paid for ending the pandemic by virus eradication is not comparable to the one paid for by generating herd immunity and allowing the virus to enter an endemic state. Those who are enforcing mass vaccination are opting for the former instead of the latter, an act that will be remembered as the deadliest sin ever. \n\n \n\n \n\n SOURCE\n\n \n\n It seems as though Pfizer was acutely aware of this phenomena which they observed happening during their trials, but still had the mRNA drug rapidly approved anyway. They probably didn't anticipate their confidential documents would be leaked to the public, however. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Now, according to confidential documents authored by Pfizer that it wanted to deperately keep secret, the company hasn\u2019t just caused damage to the public purse, it appears it has also caused damage to the publics health, because Pfizer admit that Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease is a a very real theoretical risk for its Covid-19 vaccine. \n\n \n\n The confidential document titled \u20185.3.6 CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS OF POST-AUTHORIZATION ADVERSE EVENT \n\n REPORTS OF PF-07302048 (BNT162B2) RECEIVED THROUGH 28-FEB-2021\u2018, was submitted by Pfizer-BioNTech as part of its Biological License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) \n\n \n\n Table 5, found on page 11 of the document shows an \u2018Important Potential Risk\u2019, and that risk is listed as \u2018Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED), including Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Reporatory Disease (VAERD)\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n Pfizer writes in the description section that \u2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \u2018an expected rate of VAED is difficult to establish so a meaningful observed / expected analysis cannot be conducted at this point based on available data. The feasibility of conducting such an analysis will be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis as data on the virus grows and the vaccine safety data continues to accrue\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n In the UK the Pfizer jab was granted emergency use authorisation on the 8th Dec 20, and the first injection was administered the following day. By April 2021, 5 months later, Pfizer was admitting that it did not have a clue if its Covid-19 injections caused VAED, and that they will only know once they have more data. \n\n \n\n This confirms in black and white that the general public have been taking part in possibly the largest experiment ever conducted, and it\u2019s an expirement that has made a select few extremely rich. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \u2018Since the first temporary authorization for emergency supply under Regulation 174 in the UK (01 December 2020) and through 28 February 2021, 138 cases [0.33% of the total PM dataset], reporting 317 potentially relevant events were retrieved.\u2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n According to Pfizer those 138 cases reporting 317 VAED relevant events included \u2013 \n\n \n\n 71 incidents in the UK; \n\n 25 incidents in the USA; \n\n 14 incidents in Germany; \n\n 16 incidents in France, Italy, Mexico & Spain (4 each); \n\n 3 incidents in Denmark; \n\n and 9 incidents from 9 different countries \n\n \n\n \n\n Here we see real world data corroborating this phenomena: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The highest death-rate in the past month among the fully vaccinated was recorded as 14.05 per 100,000 individuals in the week beginning 8th Jan 22.\n\n \n\n But at the same time the rate per 100,000 unvaccinated individuals was recorded as being 10.4. Meaning during this week the fully vaccinated were statistically 1.4 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated. \n\n \n\n However, the most concerning figures came in the week beginning 18th Dec 21. During these seven days the death-rate per 100,000 was recorded as 6.55 in the fully vaccinated, but just 1.69 in the unvaccinated. Therefore, during this week the fully vaccinated were statistically 4 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than the not-vaccinated. \n\n \n\n \n\n LINK TO ARTICLE \n\n \n\n LEAKED PFIZER DOCUMENTS \n\n \n\n \n\n edit on 3-2-2022 by v1rtu0s0 because: (no reason given)\n\n \n\n edit on 3-2-2022 by v1rtu0s0 because: (no reason given)\n\n \n\n edit on 3-2-2022 by v1rtu0s0 because: (no reason given)\n\n Unless you've been living in a cave for the last 2 years, you've probably heard something about ADE, aka antibody dependent enhancement. In laymen's terms this means that the vaccine leaves your immune system worse off than having no vaccine at all. In the end, not only does it make you more susceptible to complications from the virus, but it extends the pandemic much longer than it would normally last without use of a leaky vaccine. The end result is that exponentially more people die.This is something Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche has been warning about for a few years. Instead of having a virus \"fizzle out\" ADE allows it to continue to thrive even though natural immunity would have eradicated it already. According to Bossche:It seems as though Pfizer was acutely aware of this phenomena which they observed happening during their trials, but still had the mRNA drug rapidly approved anyway. They probably didn't anticipate their confidential documents would be leaked to the public, however.Here we see real world data corroborating this phenomena: \n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a large number of people who wouldn't get the jab simply because they don't trust the govt or the pharma companies. They suspected something like this would happen. They were attacked as being \"anti-science\" right along with the militant anti-vaxxers. Looks like their mistrust wasn't unfounded. It still shocks me how many people will just do whatever they're told. \n\n \n\n I became highly suspicious early on after seeing two highly-credentialed immunologists say that you develop a vaccine, especially an mRNA vaccine, in such a short time, and declare it safe. The science simply doesn't work that way. They both agreed it takes 3-5 years. Some say 5 is the minimum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n But what drove people to get the crap was the propaganda very well define, using the sacrificial lambs within the elderly, when that was not enough then the scaremongering within the health compromised put the cherry on top. \n\n \n\n In developed countries with more means of feeding and available resources with plenty of chemical medications to be able to eat junk at will and keep on living and more pills to make you happy when feeling guilty has created a generation of very immune and unhealthy compromised people. \n\n \n\n Viruses has been with us since man walk the earth and each time a deadly mutation comes around be nature made on man made we over come and move on.\n\n \n\n And yes people die, but now a lot of people are at risk of this viruses, because compromised bodies. \n\n \n\n The jabs intention were more than just to fight a virus and that is the part that keeps me from staying away from them, soon we will find out, because you can not keep secrets. \n\n \n\n Only to see the demonic intent this jabs were pushed on everybody healthy or not, was a big red flag. \n\n \n\n The experiment is not over, is still on going. I never got the darn crap, yes from the beginning I called a piece of crap, you do not need to be a scientist or a genius to know what was going on.But what drove people to get the crap was the propaganda very well define, using the sacrificial lambs within the elderly, when that was not enough then the scaremongering within the health compromised put the cherry on top.In developed countries with more means of feeding and available resources with plenty of chemical medications to be able to eat junk at will and keep on living and more pills to make you happy when feeling guilty has created a generation of very immune and unhealthy compromised people.Viruses has been with us since man walk the earth and each time a deadly mutation comes around be nature made on man made we over come and move on.And yes people die, but now a lot of people are at risk of this viruses, because compromised bodies.The jabs intention were more than just to fight a virus and that is the part that keeps me from staying away from them, soon we will find out, because you can not keep secrets.Only to see the demonic intent this jabs were pushed on everybody healthy or not, was a big red flag.The experiment is not over, is still on going. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginally posted by: ColeYounger \n\n There's a large number of people who wouldn't get the jab simply because they don't trust the govt or the pharma companies.

I have been screaming warnings from the rooftops since operation warp speed was announced, but no one listens to me.
