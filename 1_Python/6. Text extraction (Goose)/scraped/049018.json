But vaccines do not\u2014and cannot\u2014replace the work of our immune system. Vaccines are the ultimate immune-boosters, strengthening our immune system and equipping it to do the extraordinary work God created it to do. Like a military drill, vaccination ensures our defenses are fully prepared to fend off a dangerous disease.\n\n\u201cVaccines are 100% safe!\u201d say some. \u201cVaccines are dangerous!\u201d say others. Who is correct?\n\nThe reality is that no vaccine is 100% risk-free, just as no medical procedure is 100% without risk. At the same time, opting out carries risks too\u2014to ourselves and to others. Making a wise decision depends on having an accurate understanding of these risks, and weighing them properly.\n\nPharmaceutical companies naturally have a profit incentive to bring a vaccine to market. Knowing this, the FDA\u2019s approval process ensures corporations are not the decision-makers regarding the safety of their own product. Vaccine trials proceed in multiple stages, typically taking several years and involving thousands or tens of thousands of individuals. To gain approval, the evidence must show that adverse reactions are rare and strongly outweighed by effective protection from disease. Longstanding vaccines, like the childhood MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine have now been delivered to millions of individuals, with continual monitoring for safety. As a result, the risks and probabilities can be well understood. For MMR, the data reveals 97% effectiveness in protecting against measles, a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. On the other hand, the risk of a serious allergic reaction to the vaccine is less than one in a million.\n\nStringent standards are enforced, even for the recent vaccines developed relatively quickly to curtail the devastating COVID-19 epidemic. This particular vaccine timeline was accelerated in part by manufacturing doses concurrently with testing to prepare for rapid dissemination if approved. This created a financial risk (since if the vaccine failed to meet the standards, the prepared doses would be destroyed), but without cutting corners on safety testing.\n\nEven after the multi-stage approval process, adverse vaccine reactions do still happen. These range from the minor and temporary (like aches and mild fevers) to severe and potentially long-lasting. In the US, these reactions\u2014whether known to be caused by the vaccine or not\u2014are tracked by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and monitored by the CDC, FDA, and World Health Organization. VAERS data is freely available to anyone, and tracking reports apart from the pharmaceutical companies ensures there are no profit motives to skew reporting. Across the board, the risks of vaccination are substantially lower than the risks associated with getting the infection itself. For example, one very rare risk associated with the flu vaccine is the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. However, the flu itself causes Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome 17 times more frequently than does the flu vaccine.", "opengraph": {"title": "Should Christians Get Vaccinated? - Common Question - BioLogos", "description": "We seek to help Christians make wise decisions that are both true to our faith and based on accurate science.
