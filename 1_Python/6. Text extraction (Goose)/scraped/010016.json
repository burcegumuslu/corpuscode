The shot itself took 1 minute. The other 14 minutes was just waiting for the staff. There was no line. The shot was completely painless.\n\n24 hours later I feel no different than normal. I have a little soreness in my arm where I got the shot. No mark or scar. The needle they use is so tiny you don\u2019t even feel it go in.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s so easy. Go get your vaccine today. Don\u2019t let people fearmonger to you with conspiracy theories and fake news. Your odds of dying from Covid are hundreds of times higher than having a complication from the vaccine. So you\u2019d be a fool not get vaccinated. Not to even mention the collective social costs of not getting vaccinated for the global economy and the people you could kill by being an unwitting carrier for the virus.\n\nNeither the Pfizer nor the Moderna vaccines contain heavy metals like old fashioned vaccines do, eliminating even that minor risk factor.\n\nMy Mom and brother both got both doses of the Moderna vaccine and they had no significant side-effects.\n\nThe vaccine is also FREE! If you\u2019re in the USA, you can schedule a free appointment via the Walgreens website. Or your favorite pharmacy center.\n\nDon\u2019t doubt, don\u2019t delay, go get vaccinated today! And be thankful that such a painless, healthy, and effective vaccine exists at all. The fearmongering and lack of gratitude has gotten way out of hand. Yet another example of the madness of crowds.\n\nClick Here to see ALL of Leo's juicy insights.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A//www.actualized.org/insights/got-my-covid-vaccine&media=", "mailto:?subject=&body=Check this out: %0A%0A https://www.actualized.org/insights/got-my-covid-vaccine %0A", "/insights"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
