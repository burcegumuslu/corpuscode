Therefore, from July 1, 2022, it will no longer be possible for children and adolescents under the age of 18 to get the 1st [shot], and from September 1, 2022, it will no longer be possible to get the 2nd [shot],\u201d reads a government statement. [translated from Danish]\n\nWhile many are likely relieved because it means that vaccine mandates won\u2019t be coming back to school, few have followed Denmark\u2019s lead, and if the science is universal, it\u2019s a wonder why they haven\u2019t.\n\nFor example, despite this decision from Denmark, babies are now eligible to receive three rounds of Moderna\u2019s Covid vaccine in Canada, even though COVID poses no greater threat to babies than the flu does, and Health Canada admits they lack long-term safety data.\n\nMoreover, various health authorities have recently highlighted the risks of adverse effects that exist from the COVID vaccines.\n\nGermany\u2019s ministry of health recently tweeted there\u2019s a 1 in 5,000 chance people receive a \u201cserious adverse effect\u201d from the vaccines.\n\nThis came just days after Ontario\u2019s CMHO refused to say healthy people \u201cshould\u201d get boosted with what he referred to as a \u201ctherapeutic\u201d due to the risk of myocarditis being 1 in 5,000.\n\nWhile it seems that more and more authorities are warning of the risks of vaccines \u2014 which, according to Denmark, are greater than the risk of COVID for the young and healthy \u2014 few countries are willing to say outright that the risks outweigh the benefits.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Denmark Bans COVID Vaccine for Youth Under 18 - Europe Reloaded", "description": "ER Editor: See also this by Dr. Paul Alexander \u2013 Denmark: it is over!
