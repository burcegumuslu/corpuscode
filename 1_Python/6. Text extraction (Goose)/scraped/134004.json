What we are witnessing is a crime against humanity on an unprecedented scale, affecting the lives of the entire population of our planet\u201d. This morning I received an interesting document: Pfizer 2022 Full Year Financial Report, which in my mind as an economist trained in correlation analysis raises some important issues. There are two Pfizer reports One deals with Money, the other which is \u201cconfidential\u201d deals with Mortality and Morbidity resulting from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. The Full Year Revenues Report is a public document. It assesses Pfizer\u2019s impressive \u201cfinancial performance\u201d. It is also intended to be consulted by potential investors, reported by financial analysts and the media. The second is Pfizer\u2019s \u201cConfidential\u201d Report which gives you a glimpse of the \u201cperformance\u201d of Pfizers\u2019s Covid-19 Vaccine: i.e. mortality and morbidity. Released in October 2021 under Freedom of Information. You were not supposed to see it. And it is not reported by the media. It is nonetheless in the public domaine. Is there a causal relationship between Pfizer\u2019s record of $100.3 billion revenues (full year 2022) and the mRNA vaccine\u2019s upward trend in adverse events and mortality Worldwide, affecting 8 billion people. Is there a relationship? Is there a correlation. It\u2019s statistics 101. This upward trend in mortality and morbidity is the source of tremendous profit resulting from the enforcement of the mRNA vaccine by national governments all over the World. The evidence is overwhelming. It is the largest vaccine program in World history targeting the entire World population of 8 billion people.\n\nThis interview of Michel Chossudovsky with Caroline Mailloux of Lux Media was conducted on February 24, 2023\n\nTo leave a comment or to share the video (Twitter, Facebook, etc. click rumble on the lower right hand corner\n\nThe Pfizer Full Year 2022 Financial Report does not provide details on the global marketing of the Pfizer\u2019s Vaccine.\n\nBelow is an analysis of the Worldwide marketing of the Covid vaccine by Big Pharma, with Pfizer in the lead. From the outset in November 2020, the objective was to fully vaccinate (with several doses) every single person on the planet: a population of 8 billion people.\n\nIn numerous countries, pressured unduly by Big Pharma, corrupt national governments implemented policies of social enforcement and acceptance. Moreover, the devastating health impacts of the Covid-19 vaccine have been the object of systematic denial by the heath authorities as well as the media.\n\nThis whole process is \u201cprofit driven\u201d in the billions, sustained by scientific fraud and disinformation.\n\nThe US federal government over a two year period (December 2020- December 2022 purchased 1.2 billion doses of Pfizer and Moderna Covid Vaccine doses for a US population of 339 million people, at a cost of $25.3 billion, i.e at a purchase price of $20.69 per dose.\u201d By far Pfizer-BioNTech is the largest distributor in both the US and the EU, followed by Moderna, which operates in a de facto partnership with Pfizer. The population of the European Union is of the order of 450 Million. Pfizer/Moderna already account for the sale of 818.28 million doses (almost twice the population of the EU, i.e. 1.8 doses per person). (see graph below). The total number of doses in the EU is 908, 66 million (twice the population of the EU) And another big contract is now being negotiated with EU government officials who are fully aware that the Covid-19 vaccine has resulted in an upward trend of mortality and morbidity. The price of each vaccine dose has been negotiated directly with the President of the EU Commission, Ursula von Der Leyen, who\u2019s is known to be corrupt. The broader objective of Pfizer\u2019s CEO Dr. Bourla is to negotiate a 4.5 billion vaccine doses contract for a EU population of 450 million, In other words, 10 doses per person. These are additional doses to those already purchased by the EU (In excess of 800 million) Mislav Kolakusic, a Croatian member of parliament (MEP) in October 2022 denounced the planned purchase of 4.5 billion doses of the Covid-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d negotiated with EU President Ursula von Der Leyen for 450 million EU residents. 10 doses per person. i.e. \u201cthe biggest corruption scandal in the history of mankind.\u201d \u201cKolakusic jokingly called European Commission (EC) President Ursula von der Leyen \u201cMrs. 4.5 Billion Doses\u201d because she is the one responsible for this massive fraud on the European people, many of whom are none the wiser that it even happened.\u201d And now what Pfizer wants is to increase the price per dose to between $110 and $130. Pfizer Moderna have: \u201csignalled likely ranges that are three to four times greater than the pre-purchased [US] federal price for the bivalent booster\u201d. This increase in the price of the Covid-19 vaccine relies on a sustained fear campaign. Will it result in a renewed multibillion dollar bonanza for Big Pharma? What would be the likely impacts on Covid-19 vaccine related Excess Mortality? (See Part II below)\n\nSpecific details on the revenues resulting from this sale of billions of doses of the vaccine are not outlined in Pfizer\u2019s Financial Report.\n\nAccording to David Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Pfizer Executive Vice President:\n\nThis is an internal confidential document which provides data on deaths and adverse events recorded by Pfizer from the outset of the vaccine project in December 2020 to the end of February 2021, namely a very short period (at most two and a half months). A relatively large sample from numerous countries. Record of deaths and adverse events, categorized. Read it carefully. It\u2019s an internal document which has been declassified to the detriment of Pfizer. The report confirms extensive adverse effects (morbidity). It also confirms countless deaths, namely mortality. he longer term impacts of the vaccine. A recent UKHSA Report confirms that \u201cCovid vaccines significantly i Bear in mind that the data derived from Pfizer\u2019s sample was collected over a short period of two and a half months. It does not assess tA recent UKHSA Report confirms that \u201cCovid vaccines significantly i ncrease the risk of hospitalization in months 7-9 after vaccination\u201d The data from mid-December 2020 to the end of February 2021 unequivocally confirms \u201cManslaughter\u201d. Based on the evidence, Pfizer had the responsibility to cancel and withdraw the \u201cvaccine\u201d on March 1, 2021, upon review of the results of its own confidential report (Mortality and Adverse Events). The report is in the public domaine. And you can consult it. Both national governments and the media have failed to inform the public regarding this Confidential Pfizer report which comes straight from the \u201cHorse\u2019s Mouth\u201d. The data is irrefutable. This document provides an integrated analysis of the cumulative post-authorization safety data, including U.S. and foreign post-authorization adverse event reports received through 28 February 2021. Cumulatively, through 28 February 2021 [in less than three months], there was a total of 42,086 case reports (25,379 medically confirmed and 16,707 non-medically confirmed) containing 158,893 events. Most cases (34,762) were received from United States (13,739), United Kingdom (13,404) Italy (2,578), Germany (1913), France (1506), Portugal (866) and Spain (756); the remaining 7,324 were distributed among 56 other countries. As shown in Figure 1 [see below], the System Organ Classes (SOCs) that contained the greatest number (\u22652%) of events, in the overall dataset, were General disorders and administration site conditions (51,335 AEs), Nervous system disorders (25,957), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (17,283), Gastrointestinal disorders (14,096), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (8,476), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (8,848), Infections and infestations (4,610), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (5,590), and Investigations (3,693)\n\nPfizer had the choice of withdrawing and cancelling the roll-out of their deadly vaccine on March 1st, 2021. Profits in the billions of dollars were the driving-force behind this diabolical agenda. \u201cKilling is Good Business\u201d. What we are witnessing is a crime against humanity on an unprecedented scale, affecting the lives of the entire population of our planet. The WHO as well as some 190 national governments are complicit in the Covid vaccine roll-out. They had the responsibility of canceling the vaccine. The Pfizer confidential report amply confirms that it is a \u201ckiller vaccine\u201d. I suggest you browse through this Confidential Report which was released under Freedom of Information.\n\nPfizer\u2019s Worldwide marketing of the Covid-19 Vaccine beyond February 28th, 2021, is no longer an \u201cAct of Manslaughter\u201d or \u201cInvoluntary Homocide\u201d. Once the decision was taken by Pfizer to implement the vaccine without taking into account the results of their \u201cConfidential Report\u201d, we are no longer dealing with \u201cInvoluntary Homicide\u201d. \u201cMurder as opposed to Manslaughter\u201d implies \u201cCriminal Intent\u201d. From a legal standpoint it is an \u201cAct of Murder\u201d. Applied Worldwide to a target population of 8 billion people, it is Genocide. What is contained in Pfizer\u2019s \u201cconfidential\u201d report (based on a large sample conducted internally, with compiled data from numerous countries) constitutes detailed evidence of the health impacts of Pfizer BioNTech\u2019s \u201cvaccine\u201d pertaining to adverse events and mortality, including , numerous studies and peer reviewed reports, estimates of excess mortality resulting from the vaccine as well as from official sources: EudraVigilance (EU, EEA, Switzerland), MHRA (UK), VAERS (USA) J\u2019Accuse! The Gene-based \u201cVaccines\u201d Are Killing People. Governments Worldwide Are Lying to You the People, to the Populations They Purportedly Serve The \u201creliable data\u201d contained in Pfizer Secret Report which emanates straight from the \u201cHorse\u2019s Mouth\u201d can now be used to confront as well formulate legal procedures against Big Pharma, the governments, the WHO and the media. Pfizer\u2019s decision to distribute its Vaccine Worldwide was largely based on maximizing profit rather than minimizing mortality and morbidity, which is ultimately the object of vaccination. Did You Know? Pfizer Has a Criminal Record Of significance, never mentioned by the media or acknowledged by our governments, Pfizer is the only Pharmaceutical Company which has a criminal record with the US Department of Justice. To consult the Department of Justice\u2019 historic decision click screenshot below How on earth can we trust a Big Pharma vaccine conglomerate which pleaded guilty to criminal charges by the US Department of Justice including \u201cfraudulent marketing\u201d and \u201cfelony violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act\u201d? People were never informed. Both the media and the governments \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d. Today, we are not dealing with an issue of \u201cfraudulent marketing\u201d: The roll out of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine in December 2o2o is beyond criminality, it\u2019s genocide. Michel Chossudovsky reviews in detail how this insidious project \u201cdestroys people\u2019s lives\u201d. He provides a comprehensive analysis of everything you need to know about the \u201cpandemic\u201d \u2014 from the medical dimensions to the economic and social repercussions, political underpinnings, and mental and psychological impacts. \u201cMy objective as an author is to inform people worldwide and refute the official narrative which has been used as a justification to destabilize the economic and social fabric of entire countries, followed by the imposition of the \u201cdeadly\u201d COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d.
