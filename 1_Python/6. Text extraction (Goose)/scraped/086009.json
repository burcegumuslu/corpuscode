Various therapeutic and preventive measures have been introduced, with vaccination considered the primary preventive measure. This study aims to assess the perceptions and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nWe conducted an analytical cross-sectional study on HCWs\u00a0in hospitals located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study included physicians, nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, and radiologists who work in the Ministry of Health's general hospitals. A total of 394 participants were included in the study. Data were analyzed using SPSS v26, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nA majority of the participants (72.6%) were female, aged between 31-40 years (55.3%), and married (59.6%). More than half of the participants (55.6%) had received training on dealing with COVID-19. The mean scores for COVID-19 vaccine refusal, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination were 18.36 \u00b1 7.02, 14.48 \u00b1 3.62, 11.51 \u00b1 2.99, 12.39 \u00b1 3.5, 8.25 \u00b1 2.35, and 8.40 \u00b1 2.46, respectively. Age was found to be correlated with the perceived severity of COVID-19 in non-vaccination (p=0.048), while gender was associated with the perceived severity of COVID-19 (p=0.015). Marital status (p=0.001), years of experience (p=0.009), profession (p=0.019), and education (p=0.028) were found to be correlated with perceived susceptibility. Education levels were found to be correlated with the perceived benefits of vaccination (p=0.007), perceived barriers to vaccines (p=0.002), and vaccine views (p=0.002). Years of experience (p=0.017) were found to be correlated with perceived severity of COVID-19, while profession type was significantly associated with perceived severity of COVID-19 (p=0.016) and vaccine view (p=0.008)\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe study found that participants had a positive perception and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. The results also indicated that various sociodemographic factors were associated with the perception and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines among HCWs. These findings could help in formulating effective strategies to improve vaccination uptake rates among HCWs, thereby reducing\u00a0transmission and mortality among Health Care Workers due to COVID-19.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/141526-perception-and-acceptance-of-covid-19-vaccine-among-healthcare-workers-in-jeddah-saudi-arabia", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "Perception and Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccine Among Healthcare Workers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
