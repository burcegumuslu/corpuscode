Bush \n\n Date: Tue, September 12, 2006 8:05 am\n\n To: Editor\n\nI am sending you a link to an interesting article entitled \"The Secret Covenant,\" author unknown.\n\nArticle as is it originally appeared on the Bankindex.com web site on 21 June 2002:\n\nAn illusion it will be, so large, so vast it will escape their perception.\n\nThose who will see it will be thought of as insane.\n\nWe will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us.\n\nWe will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur.\n\nWe will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute.\n\nWe will work together always and will remain bound by blood and secrecy. Death will come to he who speaks.\n\nWe will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite.\n\nWe will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening.\n\nWe will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air.\n\nThey will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn.\n\nThe soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison.\n\nThe poisons will be absorbed trough their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.\n\nFrom all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this information.\n\nThe poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear.\n\nWe must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far.\n\nWe will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones.\n\nThose they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons.\n\nThey will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect.\n\nWhen they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them its for their help.\n\nWe will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things.\n\nWhen their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future.\n\nWhen their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine.\n\nWe will render them docile and weak before us by our power.\n\nThey will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison.\n\nWe will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all.\n\nTheir minds will belong to us and they will do as we say. If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives. We will use fear as our weapon.\n\nWe will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides.\n\nWe will always hide our objective but carry out our plan.\n\nThey will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil.\n\nOur families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way.\n\nWe will make them kill each other when it suits us.\n\nWe will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion.\n\nWe will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how.\n\nWe will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves.\n\nWe will foment animosity between them through our factions.\n\nWhen a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best.\n\nWe will make them rip each other's hearts apart and kill their own children.\n\nWe will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.\n\nThe hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other.\n\nThey will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit.\n\nWe will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us.\n\nWe will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths.\n\nWe shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished.\n\nWe will continue to make them live in fear and anger though images and sounds.\n\nWe will use all the tools we have to accomplish this.\n\nThe tools will be provided by their labor.\n\nWe will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.\n\nWe will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know!\n\nThey must never know that color is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal.\n\nDrop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal.\n\nWe will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them.\n\nWe will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have.\n\nWe will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt.\n\nWhen they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media.\n\nWe will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor.\n\nWhen they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that.\n\nThey will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons.\n\nWe will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us.\n\nThe recruits will be called \"initiates\" and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth. They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us.\n\nFor their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars.\n\nThey will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment. This they will never know.\n\nThe truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late.\n\nOh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.\n\nWhen all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion.\n\nWhen our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin.\n\nTheir minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.\n\nBut if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW.\n\nIf they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action.\n\nThey must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter.\n\nThis is the secret covenant by which we shall live the rest of our present and future lives, for this reality will transcend many generations and life spans.\n\nThis covenant is sealed by blood, our blood. We, the ones who from heaven to earth came.\n\nThis covenant must NEVER, EVER be known to exist. It must NEVER, EVER be written or spoken of for if it is, the consciousness it will spawn will release the fury of the PRIME CREATOR upon us and we shall be cast to the depths from whence we came and remain there until the end time of infinity itself.\n\n\n\nThe Bankindex editorial staff thanks you for all your e-mails regarding this piece, but we do NOT know who he or she is.
