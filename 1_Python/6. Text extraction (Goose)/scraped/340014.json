He continued his research by inducing Beriberi in another 29 prisoners. The experiments resulted in fatalities.\n\nIndiana passed the world's first law authorizing the state to force the sterilization of those it deemed unfit to reproduce. In Germany, Adolph Hitler was 10 years old.\n\nA doctor in Mississippi produced Pellagra in twelve Mississippi inmates in an attempt to discover a cure for the disease.\n\nCarrie Buck of Charlottesville was legally sterilized against her will at the Virginia Colony Home for the Mentally Infirm. Carrie Buck was the mentally normal daughter of a mentally retarded mother, but under the Virginia law, she was declared potentially capable of having a \"less than normal child\" after having one normal child (by rape) and was forcibly sterilized.\n\nThe settlement of Poe v. Lynchburg Training School and Hospital (same institution as above using a different name) in 1981 brought to an end the Virginia law. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 perfectly normal women were forcibly sterilized for \"legal\" reasons including alcoholism, prostitution, and criminal behavior in general.\n\nThe Puerto Rican Cancer Experiment was undertaken by Dr. Cornelius Rhoads. Under the auspices of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Investigations, Rhoads purposely infected his subjects with cancer cells. Thirteen of the subjects died. When the experiment was uncovered, and in spite of Rhoads' written opinions that the Puerto Rican population should be completely eradicated, Rhoads went on to establish the U.S. Army Biological Warfare facilities in Maryland, Utah, and Panama. He later was named to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and was at the heart of the recently revealed radiation experiments on prisoners, hospital patients, and soldiers (these are covered in the ACHE report. http://www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive/radiation/)\n\nSeventeen U.S. states had laws permitting forced sterilization. German officials cited those United States laws as precedent for the forced sterilization of people under Nazi rule.\n\nThe Tuskegee Syphilis Study began. Two hundred poor black men with syphilis began a long term experiment in which those men were to be studied. They were never told of their illness, and treatment was denied them even AFTER the availability of a cure made the study's objectives worthless. As many as 100 of the original 200 died as a direct or indirect result of the illness. The wives and children of the subjects also suffered as a result of the disease. (The government office supervising the study was the predecessor to today's Centers for Disease Control (CDC)).\n\nMargaret Sanger. the founder of Planned Parenthood, wrote in \"A Plan For Peace\" that her aims were, \"To give certain dysgenic groups in our population their choice of segregation [concentration camps] or sterilization\". Between 2000-4000 forced sterilizations per year were taking place in the United States. The following year, when Ernst Rudin's forced sterilization of Jews by irradiation with X-rays was revealed, Margaret Sanger refused to denounce him.\n\nVeterans from WW1, made homeless by the stock market crash of 1929, built a tent city near Washington D.C. while they tried to collect on a promised combat bonus which the government has failed to pay (a situation the US troops in Bosnia can identify with). Rather than pay the money, the government ordered US Cavalry to destroy the tent city. The troops attacked the camp on horseback with drawn sabers, against unarmed men, woman, & children.\n\nIf anyone doubts that our government would use it's own weapons against it's own troops, gaze upon this atrocity. These were not deserters. They were honorable soldiers, who had won the World War, been refused their promised pay, made homeless by the government's economic policies, then cut down.\n\nLeon Whitley, of the American Eugenics Society, received a letter requesting a copy of her recent book, \"The Case for Sterilization\". She mailed the book off, and soon after received a personal letter of praise and gratitude from the recipient, Adolph Hitler.\n\nIn his letter of thanks for American writer Madison Grant, Hitler declares Grant's book, \"The Great Race\" to be his \"bible\".\n\nIn a crash program to develop new drugs to fight Malaria during World War II, doctors in the Chicago area infected nearly 400 prisoners with the disease. Although the Chicago inmates were given general information that they were helping with the war effort, they were not provided adequate information in accordance with the later standards set by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. Nazi doctors on trial at Nuremberg cited the Chicago studies as precedents to defend their own behavior in aiding the German war effort.\n\nOperation Crossroads. The occupants of Bikini Atoll were told they must leave their island home for a \"short while\" during which atomic bombs are tested by blowing up captured Japanese and German naval vessels filled with livestock. The Bikinians are never allowed to return, although the area is now operated as a sport diving attraction.\n\nThe Atomic Energy Commission authorized a series of experiments in which radioactive materials are given to individuals in many cases without being informed they were the subject of an experiment, and in some cases without any expectation of a positive benefit to the subjects, who were selected from vulnerable populations such as the poor, elderly, and mentally retarded children (who were fed radioactive oatmeal without the consent of their parents), and also from students at UC-San Francisco. In 1993, the experiments were uncovered and made public. In 1996, the United States settled with the survivors for 4.9 million dollars.\n\nThe U.S. Navy sprayed a cloud of bacteria over San Francisco. The Navy claimed that the bacteria were harmless, and used only to track a simulated attack, but many San Francisco residents became ill with pneumonia-like symptoms, and one is known to have died.\n\nAn array of germ warfare weapons was allegedly used against North Korea. Accounts claim that there were releases of feathers infected with anthrax, fleas and mosquitoes dosed with Plague and Yellow Fever, and rodents infected with a variety of diseases. These were precisely the same techniques developed by Japan scientists during WW2. Japanese biowar scientists were granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for the results of that research. The Eisenhower administration later pressed Sedition Charges against three Americans who published reports of these activities. However, none of those charged were convicted.\n\nOperation Buster Jangle - Nevada. An atomic bomb was detonated with troops in trenches just 5 miles away as an exercise designed to see how well troops could secure a breach opened in enemy lines with a tactical nuclear weapon. The only special protection given to troops were sunglasses, the origin of the \"Rayban\" trademark. The troops spent the rest of their lives fighting assorted cancers and leukemia. The US Congress voted itself not financially liable for their illnesses.\n\nOperation Upshot/Knothole - Nevada tests that exposed 18,000 personnel to high levels of radiation resulting in various cancers later in life. Downwind exposures for local civilian residents outside the test area are far worse, triggering an epidemic of thyroid cancers in some 28,000 people leading to 1400 deaths. Again, the US Congress voted itself not financially liable for their illnesses.\n\nOperation Castle - testing of H-bombs at Bikini Atoll. Despite a last minute change in wind direction, the government refused to postpone one of the H-bomb tests, which produced a far greater yield than expected. The wind born radiation resulted in the worst radiation disaster in US history by poisoning several Marshall Islands and forcing their evacuation. In addition, a Japanese fishing vessel, the Daigo Fukuryu Maru was hit with radioactive fallout. The crew of 23 came down with radiation sickness, and one man died. Worse, the US government failed to inform the Japanese of what had happened and the radioactive cargo of fish was sold in Japanese markets, causing an epidemic of health problems.\n\nIn another series of experiments, the U.S. military released clouds of \"harmless\" gases over six (6) U.S. and Canadian cities to observe the potential for similar releases under chemical and germ warfare scenarios. A follow-up report by the military noted the occurrence of respiratory problems in the unwitting civilian populations.\n\nThe Tampa Bay area of Florida experienced a sharp rise in Whooping Cough cases, including 12 deaths, after a CIA test where a bacteria withdrawn from the Army's Chemical and Biological Warfare arsenal was released into the environment. Details of the test are still classified.\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia and Avon Park, Florida, the Army carried out field tests in which mosquitoes were released into residential neighborhoods from both ground level and from aircraft. Many people were swarmed by Mosquitoes, and fell ill, some even died. After each test, U.S. Army personnel posing as public health officials photographed and tested the victims. It is theorized that the mosquitoes were infected with a strain of Yellow Fever. However, details of the testing remain classified.\n\nIn a three year study, 70 volunteer prisoners at the Holmesburg State Prison in Philadelphia were subjected to tests of dioxin, the highly toxic chemical contaminant in Agent Orange. Lesions which the men developed were not treated and remained for up to seven months. None of the subjects was informed that they would later be studied for the development of cancer. This was the second such experiment which Dow Chemical undertook on \"volunteers\" who did not receive the information which the world proclaimed was necessary for \"informed consent\" at Nuremberg.\n\nNote: Dow/Corning manufactured and sold artificial breast implants even after the health risks of the implants became known. The massive class action lawsuit was only recently settled.\n\nThe U.S. Army dispensed a bacillus, Serratia Marcescens, throughout the New York City subway system. Materials available on the incident noted the Army's justification for the experiment was the fact that there are many subways in the (former) Soviet Union, Europe, and South America. Serratia Marcescens was banned in 1970 as being too hazardous to use on \"friendly\" populations.\n\nThe CIA experimented with the possibility of poisoning drinking water by injecting a chemical substance into the water supply of the Food And Drug Administration in Washington, D.C. There were no harmful effects noted from this experiment. However, none of the human subjects in the building were ever asked for their permission, nor was anyone provided with information on the nature or effects of the chemical used.\n\nOn June 9, 1969, Dr. D.M. McArtor, then Deputy Director of Research and Technology for the Department of Defense, appeared before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations to request funding for a project to produce a synthetic biological agent for which humans have not yet acquired a natural immunity. Dr. McArtor asked for $10 million dollars to produce this agent over the next 5-10 years. The Congressional Record reveals that according to the plan for the development of this germ agent, the most important characteristic of the new disease would be \"that it might be refractory [resistant] to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease\". AIDS first appeared as a public health risk ten years later, appearing first in a population of gay men who had been subjects in a test of a new Hepatitis vaccine. In 1989, work by Alan Cantwell Jr., M.D. linking AIDS to the hepatitis B viral vaccine experiments was suppressed at the 1989 AIDS International Conference by officials of the World Health Organization.\n\nPresident Nixon announced a ban on the production and use of biological (but not chemical) warfare agents. However, as the Army's own experts reveal, this ban is meaningless because the studies required to protect against biological warfare weapons are generally indistinguishable from those to develop biological weapons. Research on offensive bio-war continues to the present day under the justification that such research was a necessary pre-cursor to defensive bio-war.\n\nLess publicized was National Security Study memorandum 200, signed by Henry Kissenger. This document declared that overpopulation of the world posed a grave threat to the nation and urged the imposition of population control measures wherever possible. While the media have reported the forced sterilizations in China, Canada, and Sweden, the abuses of the sterilization programs here in the United States remain concealed from public view. A class action suit in Los Angeles revealed that Chicano women were being sterilized immediately after giving birth. The non-English speaking women had been given sterilization consent forms in English and were told the operation was to deal with the after-affects of the pregnancy. Similar abuses were reported on Native American reservations, with estimates of coerced or covert sterilization running as high as one woman out of every four. Yet another lawsuit in New York and a scandal in Puerto Rico led to the passage of laws requiring a standardized consent form printed in multiple languages in 1979.\n\nMore can be found in... \n\nMichael Parenti. [book] \"Democracy for the Few\" \n\n (St. Martin's Press 1995)\n\nSince 1979, population control in accordance with NSS 200 has become more covert. An organization in Belgium called the \"World Federation Of Doctors who value life\" claims to have discovered a sterilizing agent in the tetanus vaccines being used in third world nations by the World Health Organization. The claim is supported by the fact that only women were given the multi-injection tetanus shots over several weeks (normal tetanus shots only require a single injection).\n\nVillagers in India were offered cash payments on the condition that 75 percent of all men in the village submit to vasectomy. In another Indian village, \"100 percent of the eligible couples\" were reported to have accepted family planning, mostly by means of vasectomy, in exchange for a new village well.\n\nAccording to the June 1975 Report to the President by the Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, chaired by Nelson Rockefeller, the CIA's human experimentation program was carried out from 1953 to 1967. (pp. 226-8). At least one person in a CIA program died directly after having been administered LSD without his knowledge, an action the Commission termed \"clearly illegal.\" The Rockefeller Commission reported that \"All the records concerning the program were ordered destroyed in 1973.\"\n\nRay Ravenhott, director of the population program of the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), publicly announced the agency's goal to sterilize one quarter of the world's women. In reports by the St Louis Post-Dispatch, Ravenhott in essence cited the reasoning for this being U.S. corporate interests in avoiding the threat of revolutions which might be spawned by chronic unemployment. Since then, allegations have surfaced that free vaccinations being given by the World Health Organization include a \"pregnancy anti-body\" which fools a woman's body into treating a pregnancy as an infection.\n\nWithin months of their incarceration in detention centers in Miami and Puerto Rico, many male Haitian refugees developed an unusual condition called \"gynecomasia\". This is a condition in which males develop full female breasts. A number of the internees at Ft. Allen in Puerto Rico claimed that they were forced to undergo a series of injections which they believed to be hormones. When \"Inside Investigations\" showed a prison video of serial killer Richard Speck engaging in drugs and sex, the female breasts were clearly visible on the man.\n\nMore than 300,000 Cubans were stricken with dengue hemorrhagic fever. An investigation by the magazine 'Covert Action Information Bulletin', which tracks the workings of various intelligence agencies around the world, suggested that this outbreak was the result of a release of mosquitoes by Cuban counterrevolutionaries. The magazine tracked the activities of one CIA operative from a facility in Panama to the alleged Cuban connections. During the last 30 years, Cuba has been subjected to an enormous number of outbreaks of human and crop diseases which are difficult to attribute to purely natural causes.\n\nEl Salvadoran trade unionists claimed that epidemics of many previously unknown diseases had cropped up in areas immediately after U.S. directed aerial bombings.\n\nAn outbreak of Dengue fever struck Managua Nicaragua shortly after an increase of U.S. aerial reconnaissance missions. Nearly half of the capital city's population was stricken with the disease, and several deaths were attributed to the outbreak. It was the first such epidemic in the country and the outbreak was nearly identical to that which struck Cuba a few years earlier (1981). Dengue fever variations were the focus of much experimentation at the Army's Biological Warfare test facility at Ft. Detrick, Maryland prior to the 'ban' on such research in 1972.\n\nIn ruling on a case in which a former U.S. Army sergeant attempted to bring a lawsuit against the Army for using experimental drugs on him, without his knowledge, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that allowing such an action against the military would disrupt the chain of command. Thus, nearly all potential actions against the military for past, or future, misdeeds have been barred as have actions aimed at the release of classified documents on the subject.\n\nIn short, no matter what they do to you, nothing will happen to them. Dr. Mengala would have loved it here!\n\nAs the result of a lawsuit by a public interest group, the Department of Defense was forced to reveal the fact that it still operated Chemical and Biological Warfare (CBW) research programs at 127 sites around the United States.\n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the state court has the right to order sterilizations \"for the good of the ward\".\n\nAbuses of American sponsored population control agendas started to surface around the world.\n\nMr. Leanardo Casco, a member of the Honduran delegation to the 1994 United Nations World Population Conference in Cairo said, \"In our hospitals and in our health care system, we have a lot of problems getting basic medicines -- things like penicillin and antibiotics. There is a terrible shortage of basic medicines, but you can find the cabinets full of condoms, pills and IUDs.\"\n\nDr. Stephen K. Karanja, an obstetrician/gynecologist from Kenya, wrote, \"[Thousands of the Kenyan people will die of Malaria whose treatment costs a few cents, in health facilities whose stores are stalked [sic] to the roof with millions of dollars worth of pills, IUDs, Norplant, Depo-provera, most of which are supplied with American money.\"\n\nUnder pressure from Congress and the public, after a 60 Minutes segment, the U.S. Department of Defense finally admitted that at least 20,000 U.S. servicemen \"may\" have been exposed to chemical weapons during operation 'Desert Storm'. This exposure is claimed to be the result of the destruction of a Iraqi weapons bunker. Similar illnesses of other troops, who were not in this area, suggest other means of exposure not yet admitted to. Veterans groups have released information that many of the problems may be a result of experimental vaccines and inoculations which were provided troops during the military buildup.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June 1996, Christine de Vollmer, president of the Latin America Alliance for the Family, said that Latin America perceives Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State and top official in charge of U.S. population control policy, as \"a ruthless population controller, unashamed of coercive measures and disrespectful\" of the human rights of people, particularly women, in developing countries.\n\nBrazilian senator Rosiska Darcy de Olivera condemned the United States for its population programs, which force Brazilian women to undergo sterilization, saying: \"To say that women from the South who have many babies are responsible for the environmental crisis -- it's a scandal.\"\n\nThe city of Minneapolis was sprayed with chemicals used to test germ warfare techniques over a period of several months, in 61 separate operations. It was assumed that the chemicals were harmless, but there was an increase in the rates for respiratory illness in the sprayed areas.\n\nStudents and faculty at the Jasper School in Arkansas were struck down by a mysterious malady on Jan 31st that sent many of them to the hospital. Some of the paramedics and emergency workers who arrived at the school later become ill, with the primary symptom being an incapacitating headache, which took several weeks to subside. Despite constant monitoring of the kids by health workers, no cause was ever announced.\n\nThe United States is engaged in biological warfare in Iraq. Hoof-and-Mouth disease has either killed or crippled more than one million sheep and cattle in Iraq in the last seven weeks. The destruction of Iraq's livestock will have a catastrophic impact on the protein intake of the Iraqi people who are already malnourished from eight years of economic sanctions. Nearly all of Iraq's eighteen provinces have been hit by outbreaks of the viral disease, according to United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) officials who were interviewed by Associated Press reporter Vijay Joshi. The Hoof-and-Mouth outbreak was reported just seven weeks ago, according to the UN official. Since then 982,000 sheep and 50,000 cattle have been infected. More than 50,000 new-born lambs and calves have died. Unless the disease is quickly contained it may well become a full-blown epidemic that is likely to infect Iraq's other seven million farm animals. Did the United States cause this disease outbreak? The answer to this question is yes! Did the CIA actually implant the virus into Iraq's livestock herds? That is still unknown. But the UN weapons inspectors (UNSCOM), who were thoroughly penetrated by the CIA, purposely destroyed Iraq's vaccine laboratory in 1993. This laboratory, located in Baghdad, had produced the vaccine that wiped out Hoof-and-Mouth disease in Iraq. This laboratory was so effective that it produced enough vaccine so that Iraqi farmers were able to vaccinate their animals three times a year, 50% more than the minimum requirement. Thus, Hoof-and-Mouth disease was completely eradicated in Iraq. The Iraqi-produced vaccine was manufactured in such large quantities that it was even exported throughout the Middle East. But this facility was destroyed in 1993 because the United States insisted that the facility could potentially be used to produce biological and chemical weapons. If the United States government did not insist on destroying this vaccine facility there would be no Hoof-and Mouth disease in Iraq. It is as simple as that. Isn't the destruction of this facility an act of biological warfare? That Hoof-and-Mouth disease would return, absent the vaccine, was entirely predictable. Iraq allowed this facility to be destroyed in 1993 for only one reason: They were promised that eventually sanctions would be lifted, that commerce would begin again, that oil sales would allow them to begin rebuilding their industrial, scientific and healthcare infrastructure. Five years later, after 9,000 \"weapons inspections,\" after Iraq has been crippled economically, the U.S. is still insisting that economic sanctions must be maintained. Because the United States has not been able to overthrow the current Iraqi government and replace it with a Kuwaiti-style puppet regime, a new strategy has evolved in the recent months. New massive bombings like the Dec. 16-19, 1998, raids in which more than 1,000 bombs and missiles were dropped have been coupled with an intensified CIA covert operation - funded by Congress to the tune of $97 million. This is the full-court press to destabilize and overthrow the current government of Iraq. The U.S. wants to act quickly because world public opinion is turning against the economic sanctions that have killed more than 1.7 million Iraqis from hunger and disease in the last eight years. Is it possible that the United States government has actually introduced the virus into Iraq's livestock? An independent investigation of this possibility needs to be urgently undertaken. It is certainly not out of the question given the biological warfare resources and strategic thinking current in the Pentagon. \"Biological warfare can include the use of bacteria, rickettsia, viruses, and toxins to induce illness or death in humans, animals, and plants,\" wrote United States Air Force Lt. Colonel Robert P. Kadlec, in a recent document for the Air Force. Lt. Col. Kadlec cites Winston Churchill's 1925 vision of the use of Biological Weapons when he wrote \"pestilence's methodically prepared and deliberately launched upon man and beast. Blight to destroy cattle,_ Anthrax to slay horses and cattle _\" This document, entitled \"Biological Weapons for Waging Economic Warfare,\" speaks of how biological weapons could affect the economies of targeted Third World countries. \"Lesser developed or developing countries are in a much more precarious position. If the target commodity was a principal cash crop or food sources, using Biological Warfare weapons may inflict a grave blow to that nation's economy or society and possibly result in some political impact. History has recorded the chaos and instability created by such natural catastrophes as famines and epidemics. Using Biological Weapons in this fashion would have applications to waging low intensity warfare with strategic outcomes,\" concluded this recently written document. This document couches the biological weapons scenarios in the language of \"defense,\" but the U.S. has both an offensive and defensive orientation in the use of these weapons. The U.S. has the largest stockpile of biological weapons in the world. It has used biological weapons against Cuba's sugar in the twentieth century; the same methods were used in the war against Indian peoples in North America in the 19th century. Is it impossible that the U.S. war to destabilize Iraq would include the introduction of viral diseases among Iraq's livestock? Even if the CIA didn't implant this virus into Iraq's farm animals, Washington's strategic planners knew full well that Hoof-and-Mouth disease would certainly come back to haunt Iraq once its capacity to vaccinate its animals was destroyed.\n\nSo, do you trust the guys holding those needles full of government mandated whatever it is?\n\nReturn to top of What Really Happened", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.vaccinationnews.com/DailyNews/November%202001/EnforcMandSmallVaxNec.htm", "http://www.vaccinationnews.com/DailyNews/November%202001/BushMayOrderSmallVaxAll.htm", "http://www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive/radiation/", "http://www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive/radiation/", "http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/speck.html", "http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/", "http://www.statcounter.com/drupal/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
