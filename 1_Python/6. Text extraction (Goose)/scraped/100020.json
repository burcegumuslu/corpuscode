It\u2019s thanks to a key component called monolaurin. This is also one of the reasons why breast milk offers so many immune-boosting benefits to babies.\n\nIs monolaurin an antiviral? Yes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s used to prevent as well as treat viral health concerns, including herpes, shingles, the common cold and the flu. Overall, it\u2019s known to be an excellent booster to the immune system, and it can be found in some foods you may already enjoy on a regular basis.\n\nMonolaurin is an organic compound made from lauric acid. Its chemical formula is C15H30O4. Other names for it include glycerol monolaurate, glyceryl laurate or 1-lauroyl-glycerol.\n\nIn nature, lauric acid is a precursor to monolaurin, which is an even more powerful antimicrobial agent than lauric acid. When your body digests lauric acid, certain enzymes within the digestive tract form this beneficial monoglyceride known as monolaurin.\n\nIs monolaurin a coconut oil? No, but it is found in coconut oil as well as breast milk. As a 2016 scientific article points out:\n\nWhat are the benefits of monolaurin? Monolaurin benefits may offer help for many common health concerns, including:\n\nAccording to a scientific article, titled \u201cA Review of Monolaurin and Lauric Acid: Natural Virucidal and Bactericidal Agents,\u201d the ability of monolaurin to kill viruses has been reported since 1966. In general, it is a potent antimicrobial. This means it is a substance that kills microorganisms or stops their growth.\n\nA research paper published in 2011 in the journal Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine highlights monolaurin as a potential complementary and alternative medicine for the H1N1 flu (swine flu). In general, viruses like the flu are challenging to treat and contain because they spread and mutate extremely quickly. This paper points out the specific reason why monolaurin can be so helpful to so many virus-based health problems, including colds and flus. It actually can make the fatty envelope of a pathogenic organism like a virus soluble, thereby disintegrating its outer membrane and ultimately killing off the virus and preventing replication.\n\nThe reason why you often see coconut oil recommended in natural flu and cold remedies is due to its lauric acid and monolaurin content. Viruses cause colds so the antiviral effects may be able to help you prevent and recover better from a cold. Whether you have a sore throat due to a cold or the flu, you can skip those sugary, often artificially flavored and colored store-bought lozenges and swallow a half to one teaspoon of coconut oil up to three times daily to ease a sore throat or cough and promote healing.\n\nMonolaurin is said to inactivate other viruses to some degree as well, including herpes simplex-1, HIV, measles, vesicular stomatitis, visna virus and cytomegalovirus.\n\nFor the virus-killing reasons described above, monolaurin is often used to treat cold sores that are caused by a strain of the the herpes simplex virus.\n\nAn easy monolaurin herpes remedy is to apply coconut oil to the area(s) of concern. If you experience cold sores, try applying coconut oil several times per day to reduce healing time and pain. Not only can the coconut oil help kill off the virus causing the cold sore, but it also offers moisture that promotes better healing. This means developing scars or discoloration left in the area of the sore is less likely.\n\nFor genital herpes, the Weston A. Price Foundation recommends taking a monolaurin supplement. It points out that one dose of a standardized supplement, such as lauricidin, is equal to taking many tablespoons of coconut oil per day, and the results can be very impressive for suppressing herpes outbreaks as well as fighting off candida infections.\n\nAccording to the foundation:\n\nA study published in 2016 took a look at the antifungal effects of monolaurin (also known as glycerol monolaurate) on candida albicans biofilms. People with candida symptoms can have overgrowth of this fungal pathogen in their guts, mouths, genito-urinary tracts and/0r skin. This in vitro study demonstrated how glycerol monolaurate can inhibit fungal growth of C. albicans.\n\nAs antibiotic resistance continues to pose a severe health threat around the entire globe, we need natural alternatives to antibiotics more and more. The awesome thing is that monolaurin and lauric acid derived from coconut oil demonstrate the ability to inactivate pathogenic bacteria while not affecting beneficial probiotics.\n\nAn in vitro study published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology tested glycerol monolaurate along with six common antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, erythromycin and vancomycin) against several organisms known to cause skin infections. Overall, the researchers conclude that glycerol monolaurate has \u201cstatistically significant in vitro broad-spectrum sensitivity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates from superficial skin infections.\u201d Additionally, most of the bacteria did not exhibit resistance to it.\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome is a chronic illness that\u2019s main symptom is extreme fatigue that lasts for over six months. Without treatment, chronic fatigue syndrome may decrease memory, concentration and stamina. Some experts believe that certain viruses can trigger the syndrome, such as the Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6 and mouse leukemia viruses. Given its ability to attack a broad range of viruses, monolaurin has been helpful in some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nIs monolaurin antibacterial? Yes, in addition to being antiviral, it\u2019s also antibacterial. It has demonstrated its ability to kill infection causing bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, which causes staph infections. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies point toward glycerol monolaurate\u2019s ability to act as both a preventative and therapeutic agent to fight staph infections. In its pure form, it has been shown to fight staph bacteria while coconut oils alone are not as effective.\n\nDue to its antibacterial abilities, the food industry sometimes uses monolaurin as a preservative. Research shows that glycerol monolaurate can also inhibit the activity of other harmful varieties of bacteria, like E. coli. (15)\n\nMonolaurin is an organic compound made from lauric acid and can be found in :\n\u2022 Coconut oil, which is the second best source after breast milk\n\u2022 Cow and goat milk (both have small amounts with goat milk containing more lauric acid than cow\u2019s milk)\n\nWhat is monolaurin supplement used for? If you read monolaurin reviews, you can see that people also use it for various health concerns, including genital herpes. Are there monolaurin weight loss benefits? Studies show that long-term consumption of MCTs (like those found in coconut oil) can boost weight loss efforts. However, there are no clinical studies specifically involving glycerol monolaurate intake and weight loss benefits to date.\n\nLauricidin is a supplement that mixes coconut oil\u2019s lauric acid with a plant-based glycerol to create a purified ester of monolaurin. You can also find monolaurin as part of multi-ingredient antiviral supplements.\n\nCurrently, there are no standard dosing recommendation for this supplement. Always follow monolaurin dosage recommendations on product packaging carefully. Typically, recommendations encourage starting with a smaller dosage and gradually increasing over time.\n\nTalk to your health care provider if you feel unsure about the right dosage fro you.\n\nHow to Obtain Monolaurin (Plus Recipes) If you\u2019re wondering where to buy monolaurin, you can find supplements in health stores or online. You can also purchase coconut products that contain lauric acid, which your body then converts into monolaurin. Here are some healthy and delicious recipes that include coconut-based ingredients: Lauric acid was first discovered by microbiologists when they were studying the breast milk of humans to figure out what antiviral substances it contains that provide infants protection from microbial infections. Other than health concerns, what is monolaurin used for? The producers of some food products, including margarine, ice cream and pasta, use it \u2014 as do some detergent and cosmetic manufacturers. The \u201coriginal proponent\u201d and discoverer of monolaurin, Dr. Jon J. Kabara conducted many of the initial studies in the 1960s and 1970s that reveal this organic compound\u2019s potent antimicrobial ability.\n\nResearchers continue to look at medicinal use and safety, but so far there aren\u2019t any commonly occurring monolaurin side effects.\n\nSpeak with your health care provider before taking supplements containing this compound if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have a medical condition or currently take any medication.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Most Beneficial Compound in Coconut Oil?", "description": "Found naturally in breast milk and coconut products, this compound possesses immune-boosting, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties.", "url": "https://draxe.com/nutrition/monolaurin/", "site_name": "Dr. Axe", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DrJoshAxe", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-12T14:10:21+00:00", "image": "https://draxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Facebook_CoconutOil.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#What_Is_Monolaurin", "#Benefits_and_Uses", "#1_Cold_and_Flu", "#2_Herpes", "#3_Candida", "#4_Antibiotic_Resistance", "#5_Chronic_Fatigue", "#6_Staph_Bacteria", "#Food_Sources", "#Supplements_and_Dosage", "#How_to_Obtain_Monolaurin_Plus_Recipes", "#Interesting_Facts", "#Risks_and_Side_Effects", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/coconut-oil-benefits/", "https://draxe.com/health/how-to-boost-your-immune-system/", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/lauric-acid/", "https://draxe.com/health/breast-milk/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044790/", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/coconut-benefits/", "https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/act.2006.12.310", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2957173/", "https://draxe.com/health/natural-cold-remedies/", "http://www.cocoscience.com/pdf/a_review_of_monolaurin_and_lauric_acid.pdf", "https://draxe.com/health/cold-sores/", "https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/ask-the-doctor/herpes/", "https://draxe.com/health/candida-symptoms/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924139/", "https://draxe.com/health/antibiotic-resistance/", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244889608_A_Review_of_Monolaurin_and_Lauric_Acid_Natural_Virucidal_and_Bactericidal_Agents", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/probiotics-benefits-foods-supplements/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17966176", "https://draxe.com/health/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/", "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360490", "https://www.selfhacked.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/natural-bactericidal.pdf", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25182634", "https://draxe.com/health/staph-infection/", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40728593_Effects_of_Essential_Oils_and_Monolaurin_on_Staphylococcus_aureus_In_Vitro_and_In_Vivo_Studies", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23767861", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19895490", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19895490", "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/monolaurin-a-wonder-immune-boosting-component-207501061.html", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/coconut-milk-nutrition/", "http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/39464/InTech-The_effect_of_fatty_acids_in_goat_milk_on_health.pdf", "https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientreview-1149-MONOLAURIN", "https://draxe.com/health/genital-herpes/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12532160", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/mct-oil/", "https://draxe.com/recipes/thai-coconut-chicken-soup/", "https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/recipe/milk-kefir/coconut-milk-kefir-recipe/", "https://draxe.com/recipes/moringa-tea/", "http://sinotradethai.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/monolaurin.pdf", "https://www.selfhacked.com/blog/monolaurin-benefits/#Monolaurin_Drug_Interactions", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/goat-milk/", "https://draxe.com/nutrition/ribose/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
