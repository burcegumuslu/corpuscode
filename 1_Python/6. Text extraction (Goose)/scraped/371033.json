It is caused by Morbillivirus. This contagious disease is also known as Rubeola. The coughing or sneezing of a person suffering from measles can release the virus into air and this virus can live into air for several hours. Now, as the infected particles enter the air, person within close proximity can become infected due to this virus. Due to immunization, nowadays, the number of cases of measles has dropped to a great extent, but this disease has not been completely eliminated.\n\nCommon symptoms of the measles are cough, fever, red eyes, running nose, muscle aches, sore throat, and light sensitivity. These symptoms of measles appear within 2 weeks of exposure to the virus. A skin rash is another classic symptom of this disease. This rash may last for seven days and appears within three days of exposure to the virus. This rash commonly develops at the head and then slowly spreads to the other parts of the body.\n\nWho are at Risk for Measles?\n\nMeasles commonly occurs in unvaccinated children. Most of the children and adults who receive vaccination for measles do not experience any side effects but in rare cases, the vaccine for measles has been linked to various problems such as deafness, brain damage, seizures and coma as well. Deficiency of vitamin A is also a great risk factor for this problem. Person with low intake of vitamin A in their diets is at higher risk for measles.\n\nMeasles can lead to some serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and sometimes it may even lead to the death of a child. Ear infection, bronchitis, decrease in blood platelets, blindness and miscarriage are some other complications of this disease.\n\nMeasles is known as \"Romantika\" in Ayurveda. In general, Ayurveda describes the three doshas (Vata, Pitta and Kapha dosha) of the body as the forces of the body. Measles occurs due to the vitiation of the Kapha and pitta dosha of the body. This disease is extremely contagious as chickenpox.\n\nHealthy diet is needed for a patient suffering from measles. A person should be given fresh fruits and fruit juices for the first three days of the treatment. Measles causes dehydration in the body and hence these juices are required for hydration. After three days, a patient should be given soft diet. Soft diet include fruits, whole grain cereals and soups. A diet should be low in sodium as well as spice. Foods rich in vitamin A, B complex and C should be included in the diet. Greasy foods, fatty foods, and processed food items should be avoided.
