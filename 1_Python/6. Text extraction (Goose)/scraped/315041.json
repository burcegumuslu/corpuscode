The symptoms for both viruses can range from mild to severe and, in the case of COVID-19, can be transmitted without obvious symptoms. Common symptoms of both include:\n\u2022 Fever or feeling feverish and having chills.\n\nBecause of the similarities between COVID-19 and influenza, coupled with the renewed focus on preventing viral illnesses, more people are getting their flu vaccinations than in previous years. Recently reported data from health IT firm IQVIA show 23.5 million Americans received their vaccination between August 7 and October 2, compared to just 12.6 million for that same time period last year.\n\nYet, despite the increased number of people getting the flu vaccine, there are still millions of Americans who won\u2019t receive one this year.

During the pandemic, it\u2019s even more important to protect your health and ensure the limited resources of hospitals and urgent care centers are available to those impacted by COVID-19.\n\u2022 Flu vaccination can reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalization for children, working age adults and older adults.\n\u2022 While it is still possible to contract the flu when you are vaccinated, the severity of illness will likely be reduced.\n\u2022 Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, such as those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, including young children, older people and people with certain chronic health conditions.\n\nLast year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that nearly 35.5 million Americans contracted the flu, resulting in upwards of 500,000 hospitalizations and 34,000 deaths. Influenza is a serious virus that can have deadly consequences, and the simple act of receiving flu vaccination is the best way to prevent you and your family from catching it.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "It\u2019s National Influenza Vaccination Week - Thrive Global", "description": "As the December 1-7 commemoration of National Influenza Vaccination Week comes to a close, nurse practitioners are urging patients to get their annual flu vaccination.
