Lansing, MI-based company responsible for the software used in managing elections in several states that stored personal information of over 1 million Americans in its database.\n\nKonnech, much like Dominion, almost immediately sued True the Vote as a way to silence them and keep them from speaking out about the bombshell information they provided to reporters at The Pit related to Konnech and the unlawful transfer of information from America to China.\n\nKanekoa The Great, a spectacular investigative journalist and blogger, reported about the findings of The Pit on September 8, 2022- In January 2021, Phillips said that the cyber analyst he had been working with encountered an \u201coddity in some of the URLs\u201d such as vote4la.com, vote4detroit.com, and vote4boston.com, which Konnech\u2019s \u201cPollChief\u201d software application used to gather personally-identifying information about poll workers.\n\nUsing Binary Edge, a software product companies use to identify and assess the risk of cyber breaches, \u201cWe began to look at where these URLs actually resolve to. We found that most of them resolve to one IP address and that IP address \u2014 the URL resolved in China,\u201d Phillips said.\n\n\u201cWhat we also learned in our review, apps.konnech.com [.net], resolved into this same URL in China, meaning that the application itself was residing in China,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIn Binary Edge, you can figure out what type of database they are using, their database port, and all the different services offered by ports in this particular application living in China. It turned out that not only did it live there, but they left the database open.\u201d\n\nThis database \u201cstored the personally identifying information of over a million Americans,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nEngelbrecht and Phillips decided that \u201cthis was a major national security risk\u201d and immediately took the information to the FBI.\n\nAccording to True the Vote investigator Gregg Phillips, the FBI had already been investigating Konnech.\n\n\u201cThese were legitimate people who believed that this software posed a national security risk to the United States of America, and they were working with us closely to try to stop this from being in place during the midterms,\u201d Phillips said.\n\n\u201cThe focus point was always we needed to remove this software from the election, but taking a step further, there were a lot of other concerns that the bureau had.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Breaking: Election software CEO arrested for storing data in China is deemed \u201csignificant flight risk\u201d caught with luggage on way to MI airport\u2026 left his cell phone behind\u2026 has \u201csubstantial ties to China\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2022-10-09-election-software-ceo-arrested-for-storing-data.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "On September 8, a reporter from 100 Percent Fed Up attended \u201cThe Pit,\u201d where True the Votes\u2019 Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips dropped a bombshell about the arrest of Eugene Yu, CEO of Konnech, an E.
