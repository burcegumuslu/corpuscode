But now, a major change is afoot at CVS\u2019s all over the U.S. in regards to the COVID vaccine.\n\nCVS Health is getting rid of Johnson&Johnson\u2019s single-dose COVID vaccine in most of its locations, CNBC first reported on Aug. 4. Customers can still get the Johnson&Johnson vaccine at almost 1,000 of the drug chain\u2019s MinuteClinic locations in 25 states and Washington, D.C. But with more than 9,900 retail locations and around 1,100 MinuteClinics, this means the shot is only available in around 10 percent of CVS locations.\n\nCVS says pharmacies have stopped offering the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine\n\n eminetra.co.uk/cvs-says-pharmacies-have-stopped-offering-the-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine/628150/\n\nCVS says it has STOPPED offering the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine in its pharmacies \u2013 but will continue Pfizer and Moderna shots\n\n www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9865463/CVS-says-STOPPED-offering-Johnson-Johnson-Covid-vaccine-pharmacies.html\n\nCVS says pharmacies have stopped offering the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine\n\n texasnewstoday.com/cvs-says-pharmacies-have-stopped-offering-the-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine/400481/", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "CVS suspends dispensing Johnson and Johnson jab"}, "tags": ["dispensing", "suspends", "johnson"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fcvs-suspends-dispensing-johnson-and-johnson-jab%2F&text=CVS%20suspends%20dispensing%20Johnson%20and%20Johnson%20jab", "https://gab.com/compose?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fcvs-suspends-dispensing-johnson-and-johnson-jab%2F&text=CVS%20suspends%20dispensing%20Johnson%20and%20Johnson%20jab", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/cvs-suspends-dispensing-johnson-and-johnson-jab/", "https://gettr.com/share?text=CVS%20suspends%20dispensing%20Johnson%20and%20Johnson%20jab&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fcvs-suspends-dispensing-johnson-and-johnson-jab%2F", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/cvs-suspends-dispensing-johnson-and-johnson-jab/", "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cvs-getting-rid-90-percent-174805744.html", "https://eminetra.co.uk/cvs-says-pharmacies-have-stopped-offering-the-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine/628150/", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9865463/CVS-says-STOPPED-offering-Johnson-Johnson-Covid-vaccine-pharmacies.html", "https://texasnewstoday.com/cvs-says-pharmacies-have-stopped-offering-the-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine/400481/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/food-supply-three-states-to-recall-61k-pounds-of-ready-to-eat-sausage-poultry-company-recalls-over-11k-pounds-of-frozen-turkey-patties/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/costco-reports-50-price-hikes-on-thousands-of-different-items-as-ceo-warns-of-difficult-times/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/why-did-fox-news-fire-tucker-carlson/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/big-corporations-out-of-nowhere-kroger-owned-frys-food-stores-kay-jewelers-hallmark-and-now-door-dash-have-all-sent-opt-out-of-mothers-day/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/meet-the-team-that-killed-bud-light/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/ray-epps-daughter-confirms-he-is-a-pedophile/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/world-bank-whistleblower-karen-hudes-lost-her-life-soon-after-a-series-of-interviews-like-this-can-you-guess-why/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/fda-vaccines-do-not-require-demonstration-of-the-prevention-of-infection-or-transmission/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/bed-bath-beyond-files-for-bankruptcy-reddit-leftists-freaking-out-after-buying-stock-in-get-rich-quick-scheme-feel-sick/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/the-dragon-is-on-fire/"], "authors": ["IWB"], "publish_date": "2021-08-06T09:54:33-04:00"}
