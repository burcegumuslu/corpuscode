And many people \u2013 including healthcare providers in select French hospitals \u2013 aren\u2019t willing to risk their health by lining up for a jab.\n\nNon merci: French healthcare providers say \u201cNo, thank you\u201d to AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine due to high rate of side effects\n\nAs was the case in other countries, healthcare workers were in the first wave of people in France to receive the investigational, non-FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine by AstraZeneca. Anticipating the high rate of COVID vaccine side effects from the drugs, many healthcare facilities (including hundreds here in the United States) employed a \u201cstaggered\u201d vaccination schedule to prevent entire departments from getting sick at once.\n\nBut for many hospitals, even that \u201cprecaution\u201d didn\u2019t work.\n\nOne report indicates that the university hospital of Brest in Brittany, Western France saw up to 25 percent of its vaccine recipients call out of work due to severe symptoms like headaches, muscle aches, and high fever. Another report notes that the Hygiene and Safety Committee at the hospital in P\u00e9rigueux, France reported serious adverse effects occurring in up to 70 percent of their recently-vaccinated healthcare workers.\n\nAffected staff members include critical employees like intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and physical therapists. Aside from threatening the staff members\u2019 own comfort and safety, these mass call-outs also led to potentially dangerous staff shortages on ICU and COVID-19 units.\n\nIn other news: FDA authorizes emergency use of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine despite lack of evidence that it prevents spread of coronavirus\n\nThe world is taking a big risk on these investigational drugs \u2013 drugs that aren\u2019t even proven to work, per the FDA\u2019s own admission.\n\nIn their recent news release detailing the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine (aka Janssen vaccine), the FDA states, \u201cAt this time, data are not available to determine how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.\u201d The same warnings were included in the FDA\u2019s news releases about the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence, it\u2019s no wonder Dr. Anthony Fauci and other public health officials continue to demand that even vaccinated citizens continue to abide by pandemic policies, including social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\nSuch admission from the FDA is doubly concerning given the alarming news that participants from the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials are dropping out in order to get the vaccine \u2013 meaning these studies are no longer truly \u201cplacebo-controlled\u201d and that the ability of these trials to accurately assess long-term vaccine safety outcomes is now seriously threatened.\n\nOf course, these (now-jeopardized) trials are already rife with conflicts of interest. In their official disclosure forms provided by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, authors of the phase 3 Moderna trial endorse funding from the likes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fauci-run National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Gates Foundation, and several pharmaceutical companies \u2013 including Moderna itself.\n\nHow far will public officials go with these unproven, mass-administered drugs \u2013 and how easily will the public accept continually restrictive policies, including vaccine passports? Time will tell, although in a glimmer of hope more people are asking questions, seeking answers, and speaking out.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID Vaccine Side Effects Slow Vaccine Rollout | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Healthcare workers of multiple hospitals in France suffer COVID vaccine side effects, slowing vaccine rollout.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/france-slows-covid-vaccine-rollout-3751.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2021-03-05T06:11:10+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-03-04T11:34:58+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iStock-1211115025.jpg", "image:width": "1365", "image:height": "768", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/france-considers-slowing-vaccine-rollout-for-hospital-staff-with-many-unable-to-work-following-jab", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/covid-vaccine-side-effects-3746.html", "https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/dordogne/trop-d-effets-indesirables-les-hospitaliers-de-dordogne-ne-veulent-pas-se-faire-vacciner-par-astra-zeneca-1958278.html", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/france-considers-slowing-vaccine-rollout-for-hospital-staff-with-many-unable-to-work-following-jab", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/travel-vaccines.html", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-third-covid-19-vaccine", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389/suppl_file/nejmoa2035389_disclosures.pdf", "https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/makers-successful-covid-19-vaccine-wrestle-options-many-thousands-who-received-placebos"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2021-03-05T06:11:10+00:00"}
