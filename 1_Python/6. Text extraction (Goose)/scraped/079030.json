Congratulations and thanks for having the fortitude to work on a much-needed investigation of vaccines, vaccinations and environmental issues relative to ever-increasing autism, also must be given to Lothar Moll, Executive Producer; Lucy Martens, Director of Photography; Simon Modery, Editor; and David Hason, Music Composer.\n\nAccording to the movie\u2019s webpage:\n\nFilmmaker Natalie Beer sets off on a journey around the world speaking to leading doctors, scientists and families to find out the truth about the autism epidemic and whether or not vaccines have a role to play. The film explores the common misconception that autism is solely genetic and looks into scientists concerns over recent years about environmental factors such as medication and pesticides which continue to leave our children with physical and neurological damage. [1]\n\nAsk your local movie theater to show Man Made Epidemic on their movie screens as soon as possible, since it will be an excellent cinematic companion to VAXXED thereby putting much needed pressure on the U.S. HHS, CDC, FDA, the World Health Organization, and others who indiscriminately push vaccines based upon fraudulent, consensus vaccine pseudoscience!\n\nFraudulent is not to be used lightly, as there are various incidences that have exposed fraud:\n\u2022 The Simpsonwood Meeting in June 2000 to rework the CDC epidemiologist Verstraeten\u2019s [2] finding that vaccines cause autism. Here\u2019s the transcript of that infamous clandestine meeting.\n\u2022 Two Merck & Company employee whistleblowers lawsuit in federal court in Philadelphia, PA, regarding Merck\u2019s fudging for ten years the efficacy ratings of the mumps active in its MMR vaccine. Here\u2019s The Wall Street Journal\u2019s report on that.\n\u2022 CDC epidemiologist-whistleblower William Thompson, PhD, proved that the CDC trashed documented study evidence that the MMR vaccine caused autism in young black boys less than three years of age, and handed over copies of those \u2018trashed\u2019 documents to a member of the U.S. Congress asking for a congressional investigation, which has not happened YET. The movieVAXXED documents that embarrassing, conniving and fraudulent vaccine science story.\n\nProbably NOTHING explains more why there should be an investigation into vaccines and vaccinology\u2018science\u2019 than the candid remarks made by the \u201cfather of American vaccines,\u201d Dr Maurice Hilleman, MD, the Merck & Company head vaccine maker for years, discussing on video the very real problems with vaccines, their growth mediums\u2014animals and their tissues, cancer viruses, etc. However, now we have to factor in, since Hilleman\u2019s time, newly-added neurotoxic chemicals and nanoparticles [3]. See Dr Hilleman\u2019s nonchalant disclosure, plus how cavalierly colleagues treated the information, to realize why you really have to question vaccine ingredients.\n\n\n\n Personally, I can\u2019t wait to see the movie Man Made Epidemic and to review it.\n\n See you at the movies!\n\nCatherine J Frompovich (website) is a retired natural nutritionist who earned advanced degrees in Nutrition and Holistic Health Sciences, Certification in Orthomolecular Theory and Practice plus Paralegal Studies.
