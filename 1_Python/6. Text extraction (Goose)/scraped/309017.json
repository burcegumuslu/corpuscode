Do you believe that?\n\nOf course, not, but that will probably not undermine your trust in vaccines because\u2013as you know\u2013 not trusting vaccines is tantamount to putting on a tinfoil hat and blabbering conspiracy theories about pedophile rings in the basement of pizza parlors. It\u2019s absolute lunacy. One must never question the unshakable integrity of the big pharmaceutical companies who only produce these miracle drugs for purely philanthropic reasons. It\u2019s inconceivable that these experimental concoctions \u2013which have never been tested on animals or undergone long-term trials\u2013 might have been created for political purposes rather than medicinal. Is that even remotely possible?\n\nYes, it is possible, but it\u2019s also another crackpot conspiracy theory, so shut up and take the jab, right?\n\nWrong, because everything about the Covid vaccine is wrong, just like everything about Covid-mania is wrong. It\u2019s all unprecedented, suspicious and, frankly, weird. None of it passes the smell test, none of it. When have we ever locked down the entire country to slow the spread of a virus? When have we ever quarantined 300 million healthy people, ordered everyone to wear masks, shut down businesses, bars and schools, and pushed the economy off a cliff?\n\nWhen have public health experts and their Democrat allies usurped emergency powers and ruled by executive fiat essentially short-circuiting the constitutional powers of the state legislatures?\n\nWhen have the media and the Tech Giants removed scientists, epidemiologists, virologists and statisticians from their platforms because their professional views conflicted with the nonsensical \u201cofficial narrative\u201d of white-coat phonies like Tony Fauci?\n\nWhen have state agencies actively taken part in the purging of the accounts of individuals whose opinions do not support the mass vaccination of millions of people with a toxic cocktail that may-or-may-not impact long-term health, fertility and, yes, life itself?\n\nWhen has a giant media organization, like AP, launched a full-page attack on \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d whose views on the shadowy origins of the Covid infection do not match their own? (\u201cThe superspreaders behind top COVID-19 conspiracy theories\u201c, The Seattle Times) And why does it matter to them? Is the MSM so insecure that they feel they must viciously belittle those people with whom they disagree rather that provide objective in-depth reporting? And how does this spiteful behavior affect the public? Do people want to see their media act as enforcers of state doctrine by targeting and crushing anyone who doesn\u2019t parrot the party doctrine? Do they like it when journalists become attack dogs for the political establishment and big pharma? Is that why we have a First Amendment?\n\nBut\u2013media aside\u2013 the experience of the last year has been completely weird, hasn\u2019t it? And, yet, if one simply speculates on what they think might be driving the weirdness, they are immediately smeared, censored and dragged through the mud by an army of trolls. So much for free speech, eh?\n\nIs that normal or is someone very afraid that they are losing their control over the \u201cspinning\u201d of information? This is the reaction that one would expect from someone who is accustomed to monopolizing information and is determined not to share that power with anyone else. It\u2019s also the behavior of someone who is not being completely straightforward about their objectives, someone who has something to hide.\n\nSo, what are they hiding? Who is pulling the media\u2019s strings? Who gives Fauci and the Democrat Governors their marching orders? Who\u2019s calling the shots in this pandemic fiasco or aren\u2019t you the slightest bit curious?\n\nImagine for a minute that everything we are currently experiencing is not the random response of a government that is trying to muddle through a thorny and stressful crisis, but part of a broader plan to generate as much hysteria as possible in order to create a submissive public that clicks its heels and follows orders without question? Is that too far-fetched?\n\nAnd let\u2019s say, that at the very peak of the hysteria, a bolt of lightning appears in the night sky and suddenly there is a miracle drug, a vaccine, that promises to deliver the people from their collective misery and return them safely to normal life. Doesn\u2019t that strike you as a bit coincidental? Oh yeah, and let\u2019s not forget that this life-saving vaccine was invented just days after the presidential election. (Nothing to see here, move along.) It almost seems like it was part of a script, but that couldn\u2019t be true, because that would mean that our leaders are scheming dishonest miscreants who can\u2019t be trusted. Perish the thought.\n\nBut ask yourself this: Who is touting this new wonder drug and insisting that all 7 billion people on the planet get inoculated? Is it the scientists, virologists and epidemiologists who have no dog in the fight and who\u2019s judgements are based on the science alone, or is it the conflicted state bureaucrats, the public health toadies and do-goodie billionaires who seek access to the personal biology of all humanity in order to effect the changes they believe will trim the world\u2019s population and reverse the projected acceleration of climate change? Which is it?\n\nAnd why\u2013 you may ask\u2013 have these do-goodie-billionaire climate activists settled on public health when their real passion is depopulation and global warming?\n\nIsn\u2019t it because they have identified vaccines as the access-point they need to achieve their ambitions? Isn\u2019t that why they have spent decades creating the critical infrastructure for the global public health organizations, not to improve the lives and health of impoverish mothers and children in Africa and India, but to expand and reinforce the tentacles of this new international vaccine-deployment hydra that can reach across the earth and draw every human being into its oily grip.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a conspiracy theory. This infrastructure actually exists and it has been greatly expanded and strengthened in the last decade. But, why?\n\nI would argue that this infrastructure was not painstakingly assembled to save humanity from the \u201ckiller virus\u201d, but to implement a strategy for inserting needles in the arms of 7 billion people. This is not philanthropy. This is something else altogether. Something calculating, underhanded, and sinister. But that is just my opinion.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s all a crazy conspiracy theory and even if it is happening it\u2019s not really happening because our real owners and our new Reality Czar have already decided that it\u2019s not happening. In fact, they are reaching out across the Internet to \u201cdisappear\u201d anyone who dares to mention what they think is actually going on. That said, we still must reconcile all the inconsistencies, half-truths and outright lies with the fact that people are dying after taking the jab. That\u2019s the one fact that cannot be denied.\n\nSo, how do we resolve these inconsistencies? How do we explain the permanent state of emergency that only serves to strengthen the power of tyrants and their lackeys, how do we reconcile the lockdowns, the masks, the school closures, and the deliberate obliteration of our civilization for a virus that kills just 1 in every 400 infected people?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible. It can\u2019t be done. When the government goes crazy and loses the confidence of the people, skeptics will come up with theories that explain what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s only natural. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now.\n\nAs for the vaccines, well, we know that reputable professionals have warned us that these zombie injections could impact fertility health and mortality, but is that probable? After all, the experts, celebrities and media are promoting these mRNA vaccines with more exuberance than any Madison Avenue product-launch in history. Maybe we should set aside our concerns and just go with the flow. After all, what could go wrong?. Check out this except from an interview with Dr. Chris Shaw, Ph.D, Specialist in Neuroplasticity and Neuropathology. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cThe mRNA lipid-coated PEG-construct\u2013 by Moderna\u2019s own study\u2013does not stay localized but spreads throughout the body including the brain. Found in animal studies in bone marrow, brain, lymph nodes, heart, kidneys liver, lungs etc Doctors are saying that the vaccine does NOT cross the blood-brain barrier, but that is NOT true. \u2026If it reaches the brain there will be an auto immune response that will cause inflammation What characterizes virtually all neuro-degenerative diseases is this misfolded protein that is characteristic to Lou Gerrigs disease, to Alzheimer\u2019s, to Parkinsons to Huntington\u2019s etc. They are different proteins, but they tend to form these sheets of misfolded proteins called Beta Sheets. Now you are asking cells in various parts of the body\u2013including the brain\u2013 to make alot of these proteins and release them to the outside, and , are we sure that\u2019s what\u2019 it\u2019s all doing? Are you getting clusters of misfolded proteins inside neurons? That would be a bad thing to do.. So you\u2019d like to know where it is, how much of it there is, and which groups of neuronal groups its targeted. .and those are the kinds of questions you like the companies to have solved long before they got authorization and discovered some years later that they have a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a vast experiment that should have been done in the lab on animals and now it is being done on people ..The potential is that you are going to harm alot of people while you do this experiment.\u201d (\u201cNEUROSCIENTIST\u2019S CONCERNS ABOUT COVID VACCINES\u201d, Chris Shaw, Ph.D, Specialist in Neuroplasticity and Neuropathology)\n\nIt does to me. Frankly, I\u2019d rather not have synthetic toxins from an experimental vaccine floating around in my brain, but that\u2019s just me.\n\nNow check out this clip from an interview with Robert F Kennedy Jr for a bit of background on these mRNA vaccines:\n\n\u201cWhat we know about coronavirus from 30 years of experience is that a coronavirus vaccine has a unique peculiarity, which is any attempted making of the vaccine has resulted in the creation of a class of antibodies that actually make vaccinated people sicker when they ultimately suffer exposure to the wild virus. Following the SARS epidemic that began in 2002, China launched a concerted effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine. They succeeded in developing 30 promising models, and they chose the four \u201cbest in class\u201d to fabricate and then test on ferrets, the animal most analogous to human beings when it comes to upper respiratory infections.\n\nThe ferrets all developed admirable, robust, and durable antibody responses, and the scientists believed they had hit the jackpot. But then, when the animals suffered exposure to the wild virus, something frightening happened. The vaccinated animals sickened and died with body-wide inflammation. The vaccine had created a condition known as paradoxical inherent immune response, which amplified the injury caused by the illness rather than preventing it.\n\nThe scientists at that time recalled a similar occurrence from the 1960s where the NIH had conducted studies on a vaccine for RSV, an upper respiratory illness very similar to coronavirus. The 35 children in that study had developed a strong antibody response but had become terribly ill upon exposure to wild RSV. Two of the children died. Remembering this incident, the scientists in 2012 abandoned their efforts to create that vaccine. And that is why today you are hearing dire warnings from unexpected quarters\u2026 who have all warned that a coronavirus vaccine may end up making people sicker from coronavirus rather than avoiding the disease.\u201d (\u201cInterview with Robert F Kennedy J\u201d, Children\u2019s Health Defense)\n\nRepeat: \u201cwhen the animals suffered exposure to the wild virus, something frightening happened. The vaccinated animals sickened and died with body-wide inflammation.\u201d\n\nThis is recurrent theme when one reads alternate literature on the mRNA vaccine. It may also explain why the vaccine manufacturers skipped animal trials before seeking approval from the FDA. We should also note, that none of the current crop of vaccines have concluded their Phase 3 trials which will not be finished for two years from today. Readers should not find that reassuring.\n\nLet\u2019s take a minute and dig a little deeper into this idea that vaccines can actually make you sicker and perhaps die. Here\u2019s a blurb from a research paper published in Nature in July 2020 on the condition called Antibody-dependent Enhancement:\n\n\u201cAntibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology. This possibility requires careful consideration at this critical point in the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u2026\n\nThe implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Second, because ADE of disease cannot be reliably predicted after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies\u2014regardless of what virus is the causative agent\u2014it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 move forward\u2026.\n\nIt is clear that after many years, and considerable attention, the understanding of ADE of disease after either vaccination or administration of antiviral antibodies is insufficient to confidently predict that a given immune intervention for a viral infection will have negative outcomes in humans\u2026\n\nAdditional mechanism-focused studies are needed to determine whether small-animal and NHP models of virus infection, including for SARS-CoV-2, can predict the probable benefits or risks of vaccines or passive-antibody interventions in humans\u2026.\n\nIn the meantime, it will be necessary to directly test safety and define correlates of protection conferred by vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens in human clinical trials.\u201d (\u201cA perspective on potential antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2\u201c, Nature)\n\u2022 You could get sick and die. (Quote\u2013 \u201cAntibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) creates the \u201cpotential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology.\u201d)\n\u2022 We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. (Quote\u2013\u201c\u2026ADE of disease cannot be reliably predicted after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies\u2026 it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 move forward\u2026.\u201d)\n\u2022 We are flying blind and hoping for the best. (Quote\u2013 \u201cAdditional mechanism-focused studies are needed to determine whether small-animal and NHP models of virus infection, including for SARS-CoV-2, can predict the probable benefits or risks of vaccines or passive-antibody interventions in humans\u2026.\u201d)\n\u2022 Let\u2019s keep testing because we have no idea if what we are doing is safe. (Quote\u2013 \u201cIn the meantime, it will be necessary to directly test safety and define correlates of protection conferred by vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens in human clinical trials.\u201d)\n\nSo, while Shaw sees one set of potential problems, Kennedy sees others altogether different. But these are just the tip of the iceberg because Dr. J. Patrick Whelan, a pediatric rheumatologist, believes the mRNA vaccines could cause microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys in ways not assessed in safety trials. In fact, he even wrote a detailed letter to the FDA in December warning them explicitly about these potential dangers. Here\u2019s an excerpt from an article at Global Research that provides the details:\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the possibility that the new vaccines aimed at creating immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have the potential to cause microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys in a way that does not currently appear to be assessed in safety trials of these potential drugs.\u201d\n\nWhelan was referring to the fact that mRNA vaccines work by incorporating the genetic blueprint for the key spike protein on the virus surface into a formula that \u2014 when injected into humans \u2014 instructs our own cells to make the spike protein\u2026.\n\nBased on the research conducted to date, it is very likely that some recipients of the spike protein mRNA vaccines will experience the same symptoms and injuries associated with the virus.\n\nAgain, according to Whelan, \u201cthe potential to cause microvascular injury (inflammation and small blood clots called microthrombi) to the brain, heart, liver and kidney \u2026 were not assessed in the safety trials.\u201d..\n\nIgnoring these valid and scientifically supported warnings may result in hundreds of millions of people suffering potentially deadly injuries or permanent damage following vaccination. It will also further erode the dwindling confidence that our country has in our federal regulatory agencies to protect the health of all Americans\n\nUnfortunately, Whelan\u2019s concerns were not acknowledged, and the agency instead relied on the limited clinical trial data. The VRBPAC endorsed the use of the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 10. The following day, the FDA issued the first COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization allowing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to be widely distributed in individuals 16 and older without calling for the additional studies that Whelan felt were critical to assure safety of the vaccine, especially in children.\u201d (\u201cCould Spike Protein in Moderna, Pfizer Vaccines Cause Blood Clots, Brain Inflammation and Heart Attacks?\u201d Global Research)\n\nThese are just a few of the many warnings that medical professionals have issued publicly. They reflect the growing concerns about this new regime of dodgy vaccines. Needless to say, their warnings have either fallen on deaf ears or been lost in the celebratory din surrounding the new wonder drug. As we speak, millions of people around the world are being injected with an experimental nanoparticle that may-or-may-not impact their health and well-being for the rest of their lives. They have based their decision not on sound science and long-term outcomes, but on relentless fearmongering followed by a garish and overpowering media blitz. This crass manipulation of public perceptions precludes what any reasonable person would call \u201cinformed consent\u201d. We are being led like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the million-dollar question: Are the Covid vaccines safe or not?\n\nHow could they be? They were not sufficiently tested, the technology is new and experimental, Phase 3 Trials have not been completed, thorough animal trials were never conducted, there is no data on long-term adverse side effects, and the final product was ramrodded through the \u201crubber stamp\u201d FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) provision. On top of that, medical professionals are now warning us that the vaccines could \u201ccause microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys.\u201d\n\nThe American people need to consider these things before they make their decision.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Race", "Predictions: from the past or for the future", "Coronavirus", "Health", "Commentary", "Israel, 'Anti-Semitism', Zionism and US-UK allies", "Health and the New World Order", "Essential Reading", "Hidden and Revisionist History"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/doctor-dies-second-dose-covid-vaccine/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/national-media-vaccine-misinformation-hank-aaron/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/46-residents-in-spanish-nursing-home-die-after-receiving-covid-19-vaccine", "https://www.seattletimes.com/business/the-superspreaders-behind-top-covid-19-conspiracy-theories/", "https://rumble.com/vctu59-neuroscientists-concerns-about-covid-vaccines.html", "https://insidethevatican.com/magazine/robert-f-kennedy-jr-on-coming-covid-vaccines/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/could-spike-protein-moderna-pfizer-vaccines-cause-blood-clots-brain-inflammation-heart-attacks/5737069", "https://www.unz.com/mwhitney/coronapocalypse-big-pharmas-doomsday-vaccine-666/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
