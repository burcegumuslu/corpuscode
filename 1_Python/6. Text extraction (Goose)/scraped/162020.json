VAERS is co-administered by the CDC and FDA.\n\nICAN wanted to confirm that Pfizer and Moderna in fact followed up on VAERS reports of children dying after receiving one of their COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, ICAN, through its attorneys, submitted a FOIA request to the FDA for documents produced or transmitted to Pfizer and Moderna concerning VAERS reports of children dying after receiving one of their COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe FDA responded to ICAN\u2019s request and stated:\n\nAfter ICAN\u2019s attorneys followed up with the FDA regarding this response, the FDA again confirmed in an email that it did not provide any documents to Pfizer or Moderna concerning any of the listed VAERS reports of children dying after receiving one of their COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIt is troubling that Pfizer and Moderna do not even bother to investigate VAERS reports of children dying following receipt of their COVID-19 vaccine products. Then again, since they cannot be held financially liable for any of these injuries, there is only a financial downside for these companies to investigate these deaths. This moral hazard could explain why they cover their eyes and ears to these serious adverse reactions.\n\nIt is also why everyone must have a choice when it comes to these products. As always, ICAN will continue to fight for improved safety surveillance of all COVID-19 vaccines and for everyone to have the right to informed consent.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "PFIZER AND MODERNA FAIL TO FOLLOW-UP ON REPORTS OF CHILDREN DYING FROM THEIR COVID VACCINES - ICAN - Informed Consent Action Network", "description": "ICAN wanted to confirm that Pfizer and Moderna in fact followed up on VAERS reports of children dying after receiving one of their COVID-19 vaccines.
