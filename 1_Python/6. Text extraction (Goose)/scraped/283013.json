The Technocrats/Transhumans who are running this global human reset must be stopped. \u2043 TN Editor\n\nThe European database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, which also tracks reports of injuries and deaths following the experimental COVID-19 \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nA subscriber from Europe recently emailed us and reminded us that this database maintained at EudraVigilance is only for countries in Europe who are part of the European Union (EU), which comprises 27 countries.\n\nThe total number of countries in Europe is much higher, almost twice as many, numbering around 50, although there are some differences of opinion as to which countries are technically part of Europe.\n\nSo as high as these numbers are, they do NOT reflect all of Europe. The actual number in Europe who are reported dead or injured due to COVID-19 shots would be much higher than what we are reporting here.\n\nThe EudraVigilance database reports that through June 19, 2021 there are 15,472 deaths and 1,509,266 injuries reported following injections of four experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, half of them (753,657) are serious injuries.\n\n\u201cSeriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as \u2018serious\u2019 if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.\u201d\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here. This subscriber has volunteered to do this, and it is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nSince we have started publishing this, others from Europe have also calculated the numbers and confirmed the totals.[1]\n\nHere is the summary data through June 19, 2021.\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (code BNT162b2,Comirnaty) from BioNTech/ Pfizer: 7,420 deaths and 560,256 injuries to 19/06/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273 (CX-024414) from Moderna: 4,147 deaths and 122,643 injuries to 19/06/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental vaccine AZD1222/VAXZEVRIA (CHADOX1 NCOV-19) from Oxford/ AstraZeneca: 3,364 deaths and 793,036 injuries to 19/06/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental COVID-19 vaccine JANSSEN (AD26.COV2.S) from Johnson & Johnson: 541 deaths and 33, 331 injuries to 19/06/2021", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Shock: European Union Reports 1.5 Million Vaccine Injuries, 15,472 Deaths", "description": "It is inconceivable that all of these gene therapy \"vaccines\" are not summarily terminated by every nation on earth.
