First, will States obtain it? Second, will they use it? The first answer has generally been affirmative, given the vaccine\u2019s ease of storage and relative cheapness. The second is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nOrders have been made and supplies \u2013 some of them anyway \u2013 furnished, but vials and batches are not being used. Countries are either restricting or suspending the jab. AstraZeneca finds itself mounting what can only be a round-the-clock communications battle trying to dissuade officials not to put the brakes on.\n\nVarious artillery pieces have been marshalled against it. In late January, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed disappointment with the vaccine a mere few hours before the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved its use on all adults. \u201cThe real problem on AstraZeneca is that it doesn\u2019t work the way we were expecting it to,\u201d he told press members. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the EMA results, but today everything points to thinking it is quasi-effective on people older than 65, some say those 60 years or older.\u201d\n\nEven before any rollout, the vaccine\u2019s name was already being blackened, if not smudged. The EMA\u2019s words of approval (\u201cas there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMA\u2019s scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults\u201d) seemed lost in the noisy scepticism being promoted by such outlets as the . In late January this year, the finance paper claimed that the vaccine \u201capparently has an effectiveness of only 8% in the elderly\u201d, an assertion drawn from an \u201canonymous government source\u201d. A follow-up story did not allay any doubts, with the paper insisting it had the words of an unnamed health ministry bureaucrat. \u201cConfusion is out of the question. According to data available to us so far, effectiveness in people over 60 is less than 10%.\u201d\n\nThe falseness of the claim did little to trouble the paper\u2019s political correspondent, Gregor Waschinski. \u201cI understand that some would like to see the story substantiated with actual data,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHowever, this is not an academic preprint but a sourced piece of political reporting.\u201d This reduction of scientific accuracy to political, sloppy expediency prompted Markus Lehmkuhl, a science communications academic based at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, to despair. \u201cPrecise scientific information\u201d had been attributed to one \u201cunsuitable source, who, to make matters worse, did not want to be quoted by name.\u201d\n\nRecommendations from various countries advocating not using AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine for the elderly subsequently proliferated. STIKO, the German Standing Committee on Vaccination, was quick in recommending against using the vaccine for those aged 65 and over. The Committee head, Thomas Mertens, tried to clear the air of confusion induced by the \u2019s reporting. The recommendation was \u201cnot about critique of the vaccine, but of the lack of data,\u201d he told the . \u201cWhen there is more and better data, STIKO will change its recommendation.\u201d\n\nFrance followed. \u201cThis recommendation will be re-examined in the light of availability of additional data,\u201d promised France\u2019s national health authority HAS. Sweden\u2019s Public Health Agency also revealed it was waiting for data \u201cfrom an ongoing and large US clinical trial in Phase 3\u201d that \u201cwill include a sufficient number of older participants to be able to draw more certain conclusions regarding the protective effort.\u201d\n\nIn South Africa, a more drastic step was taken. Use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was totally suspended, with fears about efficacy, notably against the South African COVID-19 variant. The February 10 announcement from the Health Minister Zweli Mkhize showed a tilting of the government towards the Johnson & Johnson candidate. \u201cGiven the outcome of the efficacy studies [the government] will continue with the planned phase one vaccination using the Johnson & Johnson vaccines instead of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe latest round of concerns centre on whether the vaccine, or certain batches of it, have encouraged the forming of blood clots. Italy\u2019s medicines authority AIFA took what it called a \u201cprecautionary\u201d measure to ban the ABV2856 batch after the deaths of two men in Sicily following inoculation. The agency added that no link had yet been established between the vaccine and subsequent \u201cserious adverse events.\u201d Austria\u2019s own decision to suspend use was directed at the company\u2019s ABV5300 batch after a woman died 10 days after inoculation due to \u201csevere blood coagulation problems\u201d (multiple thrombosis).\n\nBatch ABV5300, delivered to 17 EU countries, compromises 1 million doses. Of those, suspensions as precautionary approaches have taken place in several countries, including Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Luxembourg.\n\nRumbles have also been registered in Scandinavia after Denmark recorded the death of a 60-year-old woman from a blood clot after receiving a dose from the ABV5300 batch. A two-week suspension of shots was imposed. \u201cIt is currently not possible to conclude whether there is a link,\u201d wrote Health Minister Magnus Heunicke on Twitter. \u201cWe are acting early, it needs to be thoroughly investigated.\u201d\n\nNorway did not wish to be out of step. \u201cThis is a cautionary decision,\u201d chorused the director of infection prevention and control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI). The duration of the suspension was not clarified. \u201cWe \u2026 await information to see if there is a link between the vaccination and this case with a blood clot.\u201d And just to make the picture complete, Iceland joined the vaccine suspension family.\n\nOn March 11, the EMA tried to stem any prospect of panic. \u201cThere is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine.\u201d It added that the benefits of the vaccine \u201ccontinue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered while investigation of cases of thromboembolic events is ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) called the measure by Iceland, Denmark and Norway merely \u201cprecautionary\u201d. \u201cIt has not been confirmed that the report of a blood clot was caused by the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. People should still go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so.\u201d\n\nSpeaking for the MHRA, Dr Phil Bryan stated that, \u201cBlood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca have now been administrated across the UK.\u201d The reported blood clot cases were \u201cnot greater than the number that would have occurred naturally in the vaccinated population.\u201d\n\nThe medical wisdom on this remains consistent: certain adverse events will happen; comorbidities can play a distracting role. To quote Dr Peter English, till recently Chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, the introduction of a new vaccine with \u201creports of adverse events such as this\u201d was far from \u201cunusual\u201d. On the contrary, it showed \u201cthat adverse reaction monitoring systems are working\u201d rather than indicating a causal link between the reaction and the vaccination.\n\nA meaningful strategy against pandemic suppression is not merely whether successful vaccines can be made, let alone successfully delivered, but whether the communications work. Unfortunately for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the patchy reputations of pharmaceutical giants, and the specific way reports on the efficacy of the product have gotten traction, have damaged it. The risks of being Handelsblatted are never far away.\n\nDr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He lectures at RMIT University, Melbourne.
