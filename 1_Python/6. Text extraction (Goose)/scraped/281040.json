The effectiveness of DNA adenovector vaccines like AstraZeneca is likely already below 60% (against infections).\n\n(Update: By July, vaccine protection against infection dropped below 20%).\n\nIn a particularly remarkable case, a vaccinated Israeli caught the Indian variant in London, infected another vaccinated person in Israel, who infected another vaccinated person, who infected about 80 students at a high school party. In all likelihood, most of these transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically, i.e. without people knowing they were infected and infectious.\n\nAs the above map shows, many US states have already banned \u201cvaccine passports\u201d, though people may still require them for international travel. In the UK, the situation remains somewhat uncertain, whereas the EU and several Asian countries remain determined to implement their \u201cvaccine passport\u201d schemes. Israel phased out its \u201cgreen pass\u201d in June, but there are talks of \u201creactivating\u201d it.\n\nAfter face masks, lockdowns and \u201ccontact tracing apps\u201d (inserted into three billion mobile phones by Google and Apple), \u201cvaccine passports\u201d are yet another major \u201cfailure\u201d in the international response to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the goal should be to achieve vaccine protection against severe disease in the high-risk group, avoid vaccine casualties in the low-risk group, and make progress in the research and use of effective and affordable early treatment options.\n\nSee also: The global \u201cvaccine passport\u201d agenda (February 2021)", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The failure of \"vaccine passports\"", "description": "With vaccine effectiveness down to just 60%, the case for \"vaccine passports\" implodes.", "url": "https://swprs.org/the-failure-of-vaccine-passports/", "site_name": "Swiss Policy Research", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-21T10:38:40+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/usa-vaccine-passports-july-2021.png?fit=1261%2C879&ssl=1", "image:width": "1261", "image:height": "879", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/usa-vaccine-passports-july-2021.png?ssl=1", "https://swprs.org/the-vaccine-passport-agenda/", "https://www.biometricupdate.com/201909/id2020-and-partners-launch-program-to-provide-digital-id-with-vaccines", "https://swprs.org/coronavirus-variants-what-next/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-05/israel-sees-decline-in-pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-rate-ynet-says", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/", "https://www.timesofisrael.com/officials-to-weigh-reimposing-some-virus-restrictions-as-delta-variant-spreads/", "https://swprs.org/pre-symptomatic-transmission-is-very-real/", "https://swprs.org/vaccine-passport-update/", "https://www.jpost.com/health-science/israel-surpasses-100000-teens-vaccinated-against-covid-19-672805", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/apple-google-bring-covid-19-contact-tracing-to-3-billion-people", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccine-adverse-events/", "https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/", "https://swprs.org/the-vaccine-passport-agenda/", "https://nltimes.nl/2021/07/29/one-person-responsible-180-coronavirus-cases-one-night-enschede-club", "https://nltimes.nl/2021/07/29/130-attendees-utrecht-festival-already-coronavirus-event-july-super-spreader", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9805411/Anthony-Hess-spreads-Delta-Covid-strain-sixty-people-single-weekend-Los-Angeles.html", "#see-also", "https://swprs.org/covid19-facts/", "https://swprs.org/covid-19-mortality-overview/", "https://swprs.org/why-covid-19-is-a-strange-pandemic/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
