It is not meant to be a diagnosis for healing or treating any specific disease, symptoms, or side effects.\n\nAll jokes aside (no, 2021 wasn\u2019t the easiest year to do dry January), cleaning up my diet, exercise, and even thought patterns last month left me feeling energized, healthier, and\u2014believe it or not\u2014wanting more. I\u2019m extending this focus further, through the full first quarter.\n\nA little background: I had COVID-19 early on, and it left me with some long-tail fatigue and brain fog. In January, I had some tests done that showed really high levels of inflammation in my body. So I turned to one of the smartest experts I know in this space, the functional medicine practitioner Dr. Will Cole. After he saw all my labs, he explained that this was a case where the road to healing was going to be longer than usual.\n\nSo we\u2019ve been doing a version of a protocol he outlines in his forthcoming book, Intuitive Fasting. It\u2019s keto and plant-based but flexible (I\u2019ve been having fish and a few other meats), and I fast until 11 a.m. every day. Now, I\u2019m accustomed to cleanses\u2014like the straight-up six-day bone broth cleanse from OWL Venice I did in January\u2014but something that\u2019s more freewheeling like Will\u2019s plan has definitely been more of an adjustment. So I\u2019ve been cooking a lot, and some of it is really delicious: I made scallops with crispy capers and sage the other day, asparagus with bacon vinaigrette, and some little artichokes with stuffed herbs and garlic. I\u2019ve even found a great sugar-free kimchi (Madge\u2019s vegan daikon kimchi\u2014it\u2019s amazing) and a sugar-free kombucha, and I\u2019ve been using lots of coconut aminos in my recipes. Will gives you the guidelines and lots of recipes, but you do steer yourself a bit more, and I\u2019m hoping that helps me form some lasting habits.\n\nThere\u2019s no sugar, and of course no alcohol, so I\u2019ve been doing major research and finding some great stuff to support what I\u2019m doing. One of my favorites is Seedlip\u2014the incredible herbal nonalcoholic cocktails really scratch that end-of-day itch (or the I-need-something-sophisticated-with-dinner itch, or the something-in-front-of-a-roaring fire one, or the laughing-with-girlfriends one) for me. There are three flavors (I especially love Garden 108), and all are sugar-free with no calories. I like it in a diamond-patterned double old-fashioned glass, with lemon and a splash of sparkling water. It\u2019s so good.\n\u2022 In partnership with our friends at Seedlip\n\nWill\u2019s also got me on supplements, most of them in service of a healthier gut: There\u2019s butyrate, which Will says supports a healthy microbiome, and then in my daily Madame Ovary supplement, I get fish oil, B vitamins, some vitamin D3 (I add more, but there\u2019s 500 IU in there to start), selenium, and zinc, all of which Will says are critical for me right now. I get even more zinc and selenium, along with the antioxidants vitamin C and resveratrol, in my G.Tox Detoxifying Superpowder, which I mix with water. Will has me taking the G.Tox morning and night.\n\u2022 Everything I\u2019m doing feels good, like a gift to my body. I have energy, I\u2019m working out in the mornings, and I\u2019m doing an infrared sauna as often as I can, all in service of healing. A side benefit is my skin, which makes me happy\u2014and makes me want to double down on skin care even more. Let\u2019s make 2021 the year of never needing makeup, people!\n\u2022 I see a real difference when I use vitamin C serum in the mornings\u2014a difference in glow. It\u2019s noticeable enough that people have asked me what I\u2019m using, and this is over Zoom!\n\u2022 The secret formula\u2014for my skin, anyway\u2014is to combine the vitamin C (smooth it in, then wait a beat) with our new face oil. I\u2019ve always been into oils, but this one\u2019s got amazing clinical results: You see fewer wrinkles, firmer skin, softer skin. But layer it on over the vitamin C serum and I\u2019m telling you, the glow is next-level. Do that every morning and your skin is going to look great no matter what.\n\u2022 Then the foundation that makes it all work\u2014always\u2014is my super powerful once-a-week (I do it on Sunday nights) 15% glycolic acid peel. And right now it\u2019s even more important, in the absence of being able to get to the dermatologist or the facialist. You swipe the peel onto clean skin and go to bed, and you\u2019ve taken care of your skin for a whole week\u2014you wake up, wash your face, and check out your skin in the mirror. Worth it!\n\u2022 Moving your body and sweating out toxins makes an enormous difference, of course. But beyond the benefits of a sauna and even my favorite workouts, when I go for a hike, I know I\u2019m getting something different\u2014stimulating my brain and body in ways I can\u2019t get otherwise. Nature heals, really! I\u2019m obsessed with Hoka boots, especially this pair.\n\u2022 I love to wear something that\u2019s easily layerable and (important) can transition to a Zoom call if I end up spending more time hiking than originally planned (guilty), like this sleek tank.\n\u2022 The necklace is just me. I can\u2019t go out without a necklace. I love to wear several at once, but for a hike, just this one is perfect. And it gives me a little bit of polish for that Zoom call I\u2019m late for.\n\u2022 This T-shirt is my favorite thing. I dress it up, dress it down\u2014I wear it all the time\n\u2022 Last of all, I\u2019m reaching out to the people I\u2019m not seeing every day. It\u2019s almost been a year; we all need some encouragement to keep going\u2014and to keep going on a healthier path. This wellness care package has liposomal vitamin C, herbal tea, and manuka honey, along with one of the more incredible memoirs you\u2019ll ever read and some fantastic essential oil blends. I\u2019ve been sending it off to just about everybody I can think of\u2014it\u2019s such a nice present to unwrap.\n\u2022 If a full care package doesn\u2019t work with the budget, this bath is another of my favorite presents to send with a similar sentiment.\n\u2022 Bonus: What\u2019s Back in Stock on goop \n\n(That I Could Not Be More Excited About)\n\u2022 These babies really work\u2014that\u2019s all I can say. And they taste like the best chocolate mint ever. I can start having them when I begin easing up on the protocol, and I cannot wait. goop Wellness Knock Me Out goop, $55 for 60 chews/$30 for 30 chews\n\u2022 This is magic for your pores. I use it in the shower every morning: It\u2019s a foamy, fresh combination of malachite and fruit acids that sweeps everything away and leaves my skin baby-soft and\u2014not kidding\u2014practically poreless.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the products recommended here.
