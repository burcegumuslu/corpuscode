If you\u2019ve followed any of our earlier work, you may already know that it has to do with those long, white trails of fake clouds that are emitted from airplanes on a regular basis.\n\nThese artificial clouds, we now know, are laced with harmful chemicals that, combined with other chemicals in our food and water, are highly toxic to the human body. And what\u2019s worse is that everyday humans have no control over whether or not they breathe air that\u2019s contaminated with these chemicals.\n\n\u201cI fight the fluoride issue as well, the GMO issue, the mercury in the vaccines issue,\u201d says Pallen.\n\n\u201cWe can control the water we drink, we control the food we eat, we can control if we take vaccines or not, but we cannot control the air that we breathe. And through tests of water, soil, snow, and air, we have found very, very high quantities of aluminum, barium, strontium, we found arsenic, mercury, lead, and this is nano-particulate form metals that bypass the blood-brain barrier.\u201d\n\nBe sure to watch the full InfoWars segment with Greg Pallen at Brighteon.com below:\n\nChemtrail chemicals are combining with fluoride in water to completely destroy people\u2019s brains\n\nWith all that he already knows about fluoride, Pallen decided to investigate further the potential interactions between this known neurotoxin that\u2019s deliberately added to many municipal water supplies, and the various chemicals that are emitted from airplanes as part of chemtrailing endeavors. And what he found is nothing short of shocking.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine aluminum with fluoride, you get a 10,000 percent increase in toxicity,\u201d Pallen warns. \u201cSo the people who are drinking fluoridated water, and then breathing this nano-particulate aluminum, that alone should be a huge cause for concern \u2026 We have to get the spraying stopped.\u201d\n\nBesides renting out billboards, often on his own dime, and spreading the message wherever he goes, Pallen believes that another useful tool is to get out in front of the buildings where propaganda is being spread \u2013 in this case The Weather Channel, which is perhaps the nation\u2019s most well-known purveyor of weather-related news.\n\n\u201cThis is the belly of this beast,\u201d says Pallen about The Weather Channel.\n\n\u201cThis is the propaganda machine that helps sell the polar vortexes and the new types of cloud formations that are clearly not normal. I\u2019ve watched the sky, they start spraying at approximately, a lot of days, 12 noon \u2026 and by late afternoon, it starts out as a criss-cross pattern, and if you watch those trails dissipate, it forms a milky haze. It goes from a perfectly blue sky to a totally hazed over white sky over a period of hours.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGregPallen4Congress\u201d Facebook page is still up and running if you\u2019re interested in learning more about his agenda.\n\nYou can also read more geoengineering-related news at Geoengineering.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Activists stage protest at Weather Channel headquarters over geoengineering cover-up", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2018-10-31-activists-stage-protest-weather-channel-headquarters-over-geoengineering-coverup.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "A few years ago in 2015, Georgia congressional candidate Greg Pallen and a sizable group of truth-seekers and truth-tellers congregated in front of The Weather Channel headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, to protest a phenomenon that\u2019s been taking place for a number of years now, but that most people still don\u2019t even know exists: chemtrails.
