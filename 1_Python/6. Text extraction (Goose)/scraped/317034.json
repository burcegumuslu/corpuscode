(Related: Thomas Renz is suing the globalists who perpetrated the COVID-19 pandemic by using their own words against them.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go through all the details, we\u2019re going to answer the questions about gain-of-function [research], and we\u2019re going to shed the light of truth on some very dark places in the government,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the evidence, we\u2019ve got witnesses, we\u2019ve been building this [case] all summer long,\u201d said Renz. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be pretty monumental, and I think that people are going to have to ask themselves, \u2018If they\u2019ve lied about this, what else have they lied about?\u2019 And the answer is everything, of course.\u201d\n\nBoth Renz and Adams agree that it isn\u2019t just Fauci who needs to be taken to court. They both believe that all of the perpetrators of the COVID-19 pandemic, and everyone else who has violated the Nuremberg Code \u2013 a set of ethical principles for conducting human experimentation \u2013 should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.

Fauci added that while he is resigning from government work, he does not plan to retire.\n\n\u201cI plan to pursue the next phase of my career while I still have so much energy and passion for my field,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to use what I have learned as NIAID director to continue to advance science and public health and to inspire and mentor the next generation of scientific leaders as they help prepare the world to face future infectious diseases.\u201d\n\nAdams and Renz will certainly not miss Fauci.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to scoot out of town before he can be investigated,\u201d noted Adams. \u201cYou have now members of Congress and senators even calling for investigations into Fauci.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going away,\u201d said Renz. \u201c[But] I\u2019m still going to be fighting and all these guys are gonna go away.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Fauci at FauciTruth.com.\n\nWatch attorney Thomas Renz\u2019s full interview with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, on this episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report.\u201d\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nFauci to resign from government after more than five decades of murdering people in the name of \u201cscience.\u201d\n\nOld video resurfaces of Fauci admitting that the best \u201cvaccine\u201d is to simply get infected and develop natural immunity.\n\nTop 8 GUILTY ADMISSIONS by the CDC, FDA, Fauci, top immunologists about how ineffective, experimental and unsafe COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d really are.\n\nThomas Renz to Americans affected by COVID pandemic lies: We need to hold them accountable \u2013 Brighteon.TV.", "opengraph": {"title": "Health Ranger Report with Mike Adams: Thomas Renz preparing to expose Fauci for CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2022-08-26-thomas-renz-sue-fauci-crimes-against-humanity.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "Attorney Thomas Renz is preparing to file a lawsuit against White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci.
