If the vaccine is not injected right into the body with a needle, it might be safer to injest it this way. I don't think I would get the cytokine storm from consuming the vaccine, but I am also allergic to milk to start with...not lactose intolerant..I get a pretty high fever if I drink three glasses of it and a headache from hell unless I take a proteinase with it. \n\n \n\n I cannot tell you if it will be safer than injecting the vaccine or a nasal spray. I have not seen the research on it or tested on myself and I gave up taking vaccines since I have had problems with them.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats4.jpg", "title": "Food Vax: Study confirms development of oral MRNA vaccine thats produced in-cows milk, page 1", "description": "Food Vax: Study confirms development of oral MRNA vaccine thats produced in-cows milk, page 1", "site_name": "AboveTopSecret.com"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
