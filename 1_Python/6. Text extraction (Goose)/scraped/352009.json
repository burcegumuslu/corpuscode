For most of the past summer, inflation hovered at just over 5% before once again increasing over the last few months.\n\u2022 Prices rose for goods and services across the board, but they are being led by massive increases in used car prices and the cost of energy. Used car prices have increased by a staggering 40.5% since last year, while energy prices rose by 27%.

Judicial Watch, the organization founded to promote transparency in government, has sued to make the allegations against her public.\n\u2022 The draft indictments relate to allegations that Clinton provided false information and withheld evidence from federal investigators to conceal her involvement with the defunct Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, the collapse of which lead to multiple criminal convictions. Clinton provided legal representation to Madison Guaranty as an attorney at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas. Clinton\u2019s Rose Law Firm billing records, long sought by prosecutors, were found in the private quarters of the White House shortly after an important statute of limitations had expired.\n\u2022 But the National Archives argues that Clinton\u2019s privacy must be protected in this instance.
