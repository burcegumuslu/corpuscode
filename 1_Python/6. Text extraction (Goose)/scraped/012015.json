I like her. She's from Massachusetts and about my age, even attended a rival prep school. She interviews people from both sides of the aisle. Yesterday, she had on Senator Tim Kaine, from Virginia, and they discussed rescinding the Covid vaccine mandate for our military. Many of our readers and some of those close to us had to deal with the military mandate. It was difficult.

The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote later this week to rescind the Pentagon\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, after Republican lawmakers threatened to withhold votes for the $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) unless the bill included removal of the mandate. The news was confirmed Tuesday night, according to The Washington Post, which also reported that Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said the removal of the vaccination requirement \u201cwas essential for the defense policy bill to move forward.\u201d\n\nThe legislation must pass the U.S. Senate before heading to President Biden. Biden, who along with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin opposes repealing the mandate, has not indicated that he will veto the bill, Politico reported. The Pentagon would have 30 days to rescind the mandate of the bill passes as is. Thousands of active duty service members have been discharged for refusing the shots since the Pentagon instituted the mandate in August 2021. The proposed legislation will not reinstate discharged service members or compensate those who lost benefits for refusing vaccination. According to The Hill\u2019s \u201cRising,\u201d Tulsi Gabbard, a politician and U.S. Army Reserve officer, slammed the mandate: \u201cI know people personally who have been kicked out of the military, some who have served 10 years, 20 years, 25 years, all because of this mandate that makes no sense and frankly is based on a lie that [Dr. Anthony] Fauci and others continue to propagate as they have throughout this whole thing, which is these vaccines will prevent you from catching COVID, that it will prevent you from spreading COVID. \u201cThe fact that it is even a question at this point whether or not to lift this DOD [Department of Defense] mandate, and that Secretary Austin is opposing it is just absolute madness.\u201d Read more at The Defender HERE.\n\n\n\nFrom Skyhorse Publishing:\n\n\n\nThe Wuhan Cover-Up pulls back the curtain on how the US government's increase in biosecurity spending after the 2001 terror attacks\u2014facilitated by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\u2014set in motion a plan to transform the NIAID into a de facto Defense Department agency.
