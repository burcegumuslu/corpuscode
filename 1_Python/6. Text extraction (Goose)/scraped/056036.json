Sinbad: from an ordeal to a new home.\n\nWhen the Anti-Cruelty Society in Chicago saved Sinbad the Persian cat, it took them 2 sittings and more than 4 hours to trim his fur. After the cat lost almost 5 pounds of fur, he had to learn how to walk on his back legs again. Elliott Serrano took the cat from the shelter, initially planning to foster him until he finds its new home, but he ended up falling in love with Sinbad and in the end, he adopted the cat himself.\n\nGregory was scheduled to be euthanized at the local shelter when Joe came to his rescue. He brought the beagle to HOUND Rescue and Sanctuary where dogs can live without the threat of euthanasia. The dog seems to be very happy and appreciative as he hugs his savior during his freedom ride.\n\n3. Roux: before and after the animal shelter.\n\nThis stray kitten was found by a family who already had 5 male ferrets at home. The ferrets were really happy about their new sister and accepted her immediately. Komari grew up believing she is a ferret and she enjoys sleeping with and hugging her brothers even though she is a bit bigger in size now.\n\n5. From a trash bin to a new home\n\n6. Charlie: from a shelter dog to an Instagram inspiration.\n\n7. Patches: from a shelter dog to the pride of his family.\n\n8. Silas: from an abandoned kitten to a huge and fluffy cat.\n\nSilas was found on the side of the road, looking very ill and miserable and truly on the verge of death. When his new owners cleaned him up, they realized how fluffy he is. Now the cat is the part of the family and even has his own Instagram page.\n\nThese pictures were shared by Reddit user portatardis. He volunteered at the shelter and befriended the dog. He felt sad when the dog was adopted since he had to depart from her, but was really pleased to see how loved and happy she looked in her new home.\n\n10. Magoo: from an orphan alone in the fields to a happy kitten.\n\nTucker and his parents were found wandering the roads in South Carolina just before it was too late to save them. When he was brought to his future owners, he weighed only 8 lb, while for his breed mix he should have been around 15 lb. Now he is loved and, according to his owner, is constantly smiling. His parents found their new homes, as well.\n\n12. From an unwanted dog to a lovable mini-werewolf.\n\nNorwegian tourists were traveling in Greece when they found Leia, a very sick, starving, and bleeding cat. They brought her to the vet and tried for several months to find a local home for her through social media and local shelters. When they found out that nobody took her, they arranged for all vaccines and brought Leia to Norway, proving the truth in the saying that you remain forever responsible for the life you save.\n\nBella's owner first met her in the shelter where he learned that she had been brought in at the age of 2 months by a man whose daughter had abandoned the dog. He adopted the dog and she now lives with him and his girlfriend in their apartment.\n\nWhen Benny's owner had passed away, he and his siblings were left alone. It was difficult to find new owners for Benny, as the cat was blind and had hydrocephalus, a special brain condition. Milo's Sanctuary took Benny in and gave him all the love he needed. Unfortunately, his condition got worse with time and he died at the age of 5.", "opengraph": {"description": "According to recent statistics, 68% of families in the US have pets at home, and half of these pets were taken from shelters or from the streets. 4 million cats and dogs were adopted from shelters in 2014 and this number continues to grow each year, meaning that more and more animals are finding their homes.", "site_name": "Bright Side \u2014 Inspiration.
