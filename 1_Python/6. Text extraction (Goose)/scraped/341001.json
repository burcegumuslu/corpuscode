Jenkins Jr. released his open letter last week entitled \u201cThe Delta Variant Is A Reality Test\u201d, wherein he first states: \u201cAmericans haven\u2019t wanted to understand what it means for a virus to be endemic\u201d, then sees him truthfully revealing: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t had Covid yet, you will\u2026If you\u2019ve had it once, you\u2019ll have it again\u2026If you\u2019re vaccinated or were infected previously\u2014which will one day be most people except the very young\u2014your symptoms will likely be mild or nonexistent, but it\u2019s not guaranteed...Nobody is surprised when they get the flu for the second, the third, the eighth time in their lives\u2026This is what epidemiologists meant when, for the last 15 months, they said the new coronavirus was likely to evolve and become endemic\u201d.\n\nJust like Russia, this report details, Sweden also knows that COVID-19 is endemic, which is why they refused to place their citizens under draconian masked-up lockdowns\u2014and while refusing to lockdown their citizens, Swedish scientists continue examining Covid-19 vaccines that work for the known strains of this virus that have evolved, with them finding the best two being Russia\u2019s Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s, both of which are based on the dead virus vaccine model used for decades to create vaccines for influenza virus strains that mutate yearly\u2014as opposed to the experimental mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 being forced on most Westerners by their socialist governments.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members being astonished over the insane reaction by these socialist controlled Western nations to an endemic virus\u2014a reaction never seen in history with common cold and/or flu outbreaks\u2014today sees these socialist Western nations forcing their citizens with threats of social and job destruction to submit to experimental vaccinations\u2014the lunacy of which is exposed when knowing the truth that whatever Covid-19 vaccines work today will be ineffective next year\u2014but whose greatest failing of these socialist Western nations is them forgetting that their citizens aren\u2019t as stupid as they thought they were\u2014which is why, for the third week in a row, tens-of-thousands took to the streets around France to protest the government\u2019s health pass law, which was passed by Parliament recently but still needs a final greenlight from a top constitutional council, expected next week, before it can be fully enforced\u2014anti-lockdown protests that have now erupted in Germany, whose police forces beat protesters yesterday and arrested over 600 of them\u2014while in Australia, it sees it socialist government having placed armed military troops in their cities to keep their citizens locked in their homes, and further saw this week leftist tech giant YouTube banning their nation\u2019s top news outlet Sky News Australia for daring to tell the truth about Covid madness.\n\nIn the , this report continues, yesterday it saw Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden\u2019s top Covid advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci grimly warning: \u201cThings are going to get worse\u201d\u2014a warning joined by leftist tech giant Twitter suspending the account of a science writer because he posted the scientific results Pfizer published about a clinical test of their experimental Covid-19 vaccine\u2014then saw leftist tech giant Apple removing a dating app for unvaccinated people\u2014hysterical socialist lunacy coming at the same time it was revealed that less than 0.1% of vaccinated Americans tested positive for COVID-19 and resistance to vaccinations appears to have solidified, with a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll finding 29% of Americans say they are unlikely to get the shots, an increase from April, when 24% said the same, and in some corners, hesitancy to get inoculated has transformed into outright hostility.\n\nAdding to this socialist scamdemic lunacy, this report notes, is the leftist Washington Post reporting in their article \u201cTo Fight Vaccine Lies, Authorities Recruit An \u2018Influencer Army\u2019\u201d that \u201cthe White House has teamed up with TikTok stars for pro-vaccine campaigns\u201d, and then states: \u201cFewer than half of all Americans age 18 to 39 are fully vaccinated, compared with more than two-thirds of those over 50, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And about 58 percent of those age 12 through 17 have yet to receive a shot at all\u201d\u2014after which they published their article \u201cVaccine Mandates Will backfire. People Will Resist Even More\u201d, wherein it warns: \u201cIf this rhetoric and these efforts lead to a de facto national vaccine mandate, it will backfire\u2026Americans from all walks of life resist being told what to put into their bodies, and many will resent any politician or institution that makes them get vaccinated, creating a crisis of legitimacy for any government, university or business that forces constituents, students or employees to get vaccinated\u2026Indeed, the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association has already said, \u201cThere will be a lot of pushback\u201d from members of his organization against the federal employee mandate\u201d.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript note that the vile game socialist leader Biden and his leftist propaganda media lapdogs are playing is one of blatant deception using Covid-19 case numbers, instead of telling the truth about how many are really sick from this disease\u2014a vile game of socialist deception that explains why the New York Post just published their truthful article \u201cIgnore The Hysteria: It's Time To Move Past COVID, America\u201d, wherein it states:\n\n\u201cTeam Biden sure threw the nation into a state of confusion last week with its scary, flip-flopping COVID rhetoric, but Americans should rest assured: America\u2019s pandemic is over, slain by Operation Warp Speed.\n\nYes, COVID will still take lives, but it\u2019s simply not a major threat to people with immunity, whether natural or from a vaccine. Despite the new alarms from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the Delta variant\u2019s dangers, and the media hype amplifying them, the bottom line remains: Only a tiny fraction of those who are vaxxed have been infected and hospitalized, as The Post reported last week. An even smaller fraction have died.\n\nFact is, as a society, we have to move on \u2014 and not be paralyzed by the vax-resistant or those demanding zero risk.\n\nThe good news: Most of us are moving back to normalcy already.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: The CDC and its public-health peers have been disaster shows all pandemic long (recall the test it insisted was the only acceptable one, until it turned out to not work?), but the failing has reached the level that the only rational thing to do is to not take its hopeless advice as gospel.\n\nBe sensible, but don\u2019t let the scaremongering stop you living your life.\n\nThe coronavirus may be here to stay, but the menace is gone.\n\nFrom 1918 through 1920, the Spanish flu infected roughly a third of the world population, killing tens of millions. The distant descendants of that virus still kill tens of thousands of people globally each year \u2014 but life goes on.\n\nThat\u2019s the inevitable future of COVID because evolution favors strains that are more contagious but far less deadly, since killing your host is a losing \u201cstrategy.\u201d\n\nIn the decade after the Spanish flu, the nation saw an explosion of social, economic and cultural exuberance. Something like that is our own future, too, once our elites get past their hysteria.\n\nIt\u2019s now time to move on \u2014 and let the good times roll.\u201d\n\nAs to if \u201cthe good times roll\u201d after this scamdemic hysteria ends, however, this might not what happens, because in the conclusion section of this transcript, it sees Security Council Members reviewing a document prepared for them by the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)\u2014an SVR document containing information about American national security investigative journalist Brandon Smith, best known for his investigation of TransDigm for cornering the market on proprietary parts for US military aircraft\u2014and contains information about former US Army Green Beret combat veteran John Moore, who is best known for releasing to the public, in 2010, the shocking news that the Gulf Stream had stopped flowing\u2014for releasing this secret information Moore said was given to him by top US military officials saw it being said: \u201cIn 2010 he claimed that the Gulf Stream stopped and that the government isn't telling you this, and that we civilians are told that everything is working as intended\u2026Of course this isn't true and the Gulf Stream is actually working exactly as we are being told and Mr. Moore is the one being full of himself\u201d\u2014but in 2015, it saw world renowned climate scientist James E. Kamis publishing his scientific paper \u201cGulf Stream Shut Down Caused By Geological Heat Flow\u201d, wherein it confirms everything Moore first revealed in 2010.\n\nAs to why Security Council Members were reviewing this SVR information about national security investigative journalist Brandon Smith, this transcript shows it\u2019s because of his just published article \u201cWhy Are Globalists And Governments So Desperate For 100% Vaccination Rates?\u201d, wherein he asserts as being true:\n\n\u201cThe stage is being set for a mass infertility event, and covid will be blamed in place of the experimental vaccines.\n\nThis is why the establishment needs a 100% vaccination rate; unvaccinated people would stand as evidence of their crime.\n\nIf a large population of millions of people remain unvaccinated after the next couple of years, then they will represent a sizable and undeniable control group.\n\nA control group is a group of subjects that act as a pure sample untouched by a drug or vaccine experiment.\n\nIf the vaccinated group becomes ill or dies from specific conditions and the control group does not have those same conditions, then that is a pretty good sign that your vaccine or drug is poison.\u201d\n\nAnd as to why Security Council Members were reviewing this SVR information about former Green Beret combat veteran John Moore, this transcript shows it\u2019s because of the just published article \u201cJohn Moore Reveals Military Knowledge Of Civilization-Ending Global Event\u201d, wherein it beyond shockingly reveals:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering why corrupt, criminal governments of the world seem to be in such a hurry to mass \u201cvaccinate\u201d everybody with a deadly, experimental, non-approved gene therapy injection, one of the most shocking answers may be simpler than you think. According to analyst and radio host John Moore (The Man), who has many contacts with high level Navy officers and scientists, a global extinction level event is approaching and the globalists are desperately trying to cull the human population before people figure out what\u2019s about to happen.\n\nIf 7+ billion people were told the truth about the coming cosmic event that may devastate human civilization, they would all stop working, causing a near-instant collapse of the entire global infrastructure of manufacturing, transportation, food production, government, military and so on.\n\nThe globalists are still buying up loads of supplies such as food, electronics, firearms, ammunition, communications gear, etc., and they need the masses to keep on working until the very end.\n\nOtherwise, they can\u2019t acquire more supplies for themselves, even as these globalists are now hiding out on remote islands, moving into underground tunnel systems and cities, or planning to be off-planet when it all comes down.\n\nThe event that John Moore refers to is a \u201ctenth planet\u201d fly-by where a, dark large planetary mass (that can only be seen with infra-red telescopes) passes near Earth\u2019s orbital plane around the sun.\n\nThe gravitational effects alone, warned former top Navy scientists, will cause cataclysmic Earth changes consisting of unprecedented earthquakes, volcanoes and even a \u201cpole shift\u201d that will reportedly reorient the physical polar axis of the planet (not just the magnetic poles), thereby shifting the equator and unleashing unimaginable ocean \u201cslosh\u201d that will inundate coastal areas on every continent.\u201d\n\n[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAugust 2, 2021 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
