They want to take away a lot of our freedoms.\u201d \u2013 Scientist Tom Harris\n\nNothing is what it appears to be.\n\nThat heatwave that hit Europe this past summer? Twenty years ago, it was just a heatwave. Now, you\u2019d be led to believe that it\u2019s all part of the climate emergency that mankind has brought upon itself.\n\nA recent World Climate Declaration, signed by 1,100 scientists, has made the rounds on social media, claiming that there is no climate emergency. But a 2019 Cornell University study found that 99.9 percent of studies agree that humans have caused climate change.\n\nHowever, more and more scientists are speaking out to declare that the whole climate change narrative is based upon faulty science and incorrect modeling. Tom Harris, the executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition, based in Ottawa, is one of them. He describes himself as changing \u201cfrom a climate alarmist to a climate realist.\u201d He recently gave a wide-ranging interview to RAIR Foundation USA.\n\nAs a good starting point, Harris recommends the non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change publication that focuses on physical science. It\u2019s nearly 1,000 pages long and has 1000s of peer-reviewed papers. \u201cThis one specifically shows that there\u2019s no climate emergency. This is the kind of information that is actually being censored by government and by media,\u201d says Harris. \u201cI met with Catherine McKenna, who, of course, was the previous environment minister, and I gave her a copy of this and other documents, and her main comment was that it was heavy to carry back to her car. And within a week, she was attacking us as climate change deniers.\u201d\n\nHarris asserts that the 1.2-degree temperature rise and the change in carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide levels worldwide since 1880 are minor and do not represent a threat to the planet. But the City of Ottawa used these measures to declare a climate emergency. All but two council members have voted to do away with Ottawa\u2019s existing energy structure and replace it with wind and solar power. It\u2019s the climate change master plan and energy evolution. \u201cWhat most people in Ottawa don\u2019t realize is that according to the city itself, and their estimates are probably lowball, they say it\u2019s going to cost $57.4 billion. That\u2019s almost $60,000 for every man, woman, and child in Ottawa,\u201d says Harris. \u201cTo do this, they\u2019re going to actually start charging us, for example, to drive into the downtown core, anybody who drives into the core will have to pay a $20 fee, you\u2019ll have yearly fees, you\u2019ll have massive increases in property tax, and of course, electricity prices will go through the roof because they want to replace our natural gas, which is a very clean burning effective fuel. They want to replace it with wind and solar power.\u201d\n\nThe plan indicates an intention to build 710 industrial wind turbines taller than the Peace Tower and install 36 square kilometers of solar photovoltaics. That\u2019s bigger than the Experimental Farm in Ottawa. Batteries will provide backup power when solar power is weak, such as the many months of limited sunlight in winter and when snow covers the panels.\n\n\u201cAnd they want to do this supposedly, to save the planet?\u201d says Harris. \u201cThe trouble is, not only is this going to cost an absolute fortune, but these batteries are highly destructive to the environment. These batteries use cobalt. And cobalt is mined by Chinese companies employing child labor in the Congo, breathing in radioactive dust in horrible working conditions. And then the cobalt is shipped to China, where again, with terrible environmental controls, the batteries are manufactured for Western green virtue signalers. \u201cYou have to ask, well, what would this sacrifice actually accomplish in the real world?\u201d\n\nThe answer is not much. Wind turbines kill birds and bats in huge numbers. With Ontario\u2019s growth and wind turbines, some bat species will be entirely driven to extinction. In California, thousands of golden eagles have been killed at one wind farm alone. And they\u2019re not very reliable, producing power only about 30 percent of the time.\n\nBut the net result? You have to ask, how much of humanity\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions does Ottawa produce? \u201cIt turns out; it\u2019s point 0.014 percent. That\u2019s around 100th of one percent. The actual change in temperature if Ottawa were to maintain this incredibly expensive plan all the way to the year 2100 would be one, one-thousandth of a degree Celsius for $60 billion,\u201d according to Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s way less than we\u2019d ever be able to detect. It\u2019s going to cost $60,000 for every man, woman, and child in the city; it\u2019s going to make us very vulnerable to extreme weather, and we\u2019ll have a very fragile energy system dependent on intermittent wind and solar power. Why would Ottawa do that?\u201d\n\nApparently, the City of Ottawa aspires to set an example to lead the world. If the world followed Ottawa\u2019s lead, what would it cost? \u201cIf you do just simple math, that would be $600 trillion, for one degree,\u201d says Harris, \u201cbut the environmental activists want to avoid five degrees of warming. So, the actual number is 3000 trillion dollars. And I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s enough money in the whole world. We have to hope that countries do not follow Ottawa\u2019s lead.\u201d\n\nChina, which produces twice as much emissions as the U.S., continues to build coal-fired power stations. Their overall priority is poverty alleviation and development. The cheapest way to achieve these goals is by using coal power. In 2030, China will use this as a get-out clause to the Paris Treaty. \u201cAnd so, we in the West will be handicapping ourselves, crippling ourselves, making our energy infrastructure weak, our economic system weak for nothing,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBecause even if you believe the science of the U.N., the situation is like we\u2019re puncturing this life raft with a pin. And China\u2019s using a chainsaw. And we\u2019re just ignoring the chainsaw and criticizing people in Ottawa for the pin.\u201d\n\nWith this City of Ottawa plan, backup power provided by natural gas would be essential. But like a car engine that produces less emissions if it runs at a consistent speed, neither breaking nor accelerating, the on-again, off-again nature of gas or coal backup power would, in fact, produce more greenhouse emissions, according to Harris.\n\nShould we even be concerned about reducing greenhouse gases? Climate alarmists are talking about carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. How much climate change do these gases cause? According to Harris, at very low concentrations, they cause quite a lot of warming. But by the time you get to the kind of levels that we\u2019re at now, these gases cause minimal additional warming. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like painting a barn red,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cThe first coat of paint pretty well covers the barn; when you put more coats on, there\u2019s almost no change in the actual color of your barn because most of it has already been covered with paint. It just doesn\u2019t do much.\u201d\n\nPresently the level is 420 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is 0.042 percent. Nitrogen is 60 percent of the atmosphere. Harris and his team interviewed Professor William Happer, a leading physicist from Princeton University who studies the radiation effects of increasing carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. \u201cWhat he shows is that at today\u2019s level of those three gases, the additional warming that would occur due to a doubling, for example, of carbon dioxide is negligible, less than one degree Celsius.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if we went from 420 parts per million to 840, climate activists will tell you that this will be a disaster. But Professor Happer says, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of obvious,\u201d says Harris, \u201cbecause since 1880, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 50%, and the temperature has gone up by 1.2 degrees. That\u2019s a rise so small that if you didn\u2019t have meteorologists and climatologists to tell you about it, you wouldn\u2019t even know it happened.\u201d\n\nA look back through geologic history reveals times when carbon dioxide was 840 parts per million, or much higher. We are presently at one of the lowest levels of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s history, says Harris. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen times in the past when carbon dioxide was 13 times today\u2019s levels. And it\u2019s interesting because at that time, 440 million years ago, the Earth was in its coldest period in the last half billion years. So the fact that there\u2019s been a recent increase in temperature and a recent increase in CO2 is only a recent phenomenon. But there is no correlation that shows that CO2 drives warming.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris and many of his colleagues, carbon dioxide is not driving dangerous climate change but a massive increase in crop productivity. Forests are getting denser, and we are seeing a greening of the earth. \u201cEven NASA \u2013 many of them are climate alarmists \u2013 says that our use of fossil fuels is greening the earth.\u201d It is also driving productivity and helping to feed the world. The more carbon dioxide pumped into a greenhouse, the taller and faster plants grow, consuming less water.\n\nNitrous oxide is the next bone of contention. Countries like Holland have recently brought in all kinds of rigid regulations on nitrous oxide reduction, which effectively means a 30 percent reduction in fertilizer use. Similar rules will be coming to Canada soon. Experts say this will cause about a third of all Dutch farms to close. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re doing this double whammy, reducing aerial fertilizer, which is carbon dioxide, and you\u2019re reducing fertilizer, you\u2019re going to have a massive reduction in crop yield. This is a really big problem. Both of these actions are being driven by the climate scare,\u201d says Harris.\n\nHarris encourages anyone interested in the subject of climate change to visit a website called climatechangereconsidered.org . There, you will find information that supports the idea that fossil fuels have, in fact, been a good thing for society. Not only have they massively increased our standards of living \u2013 there can be no denying this from any side of the argument \u2013 but they have also aided our protection of the environment by preventing the complete destruction of Britain\u2019s forests, for example, once coal became the energy source for the country. He also recommends that readers watch documentary maker Michael Moore\u2019s film Planet of the Humans. \u201cPeople were quite shocked when he actually revealed the incredible damage that\u2019s being caused by wind and solar power.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris, we should focus on reducing energy where it\u2019s scarce; we should focus on reducing pollution where it\u2019s a problem, and carbon dioxide is not this. \u201cWe learned in elementary school that this is plant food. So the whole idea that it\u2019s carbon pollution, I always say to them, what\u2019s this carbon you\u2019re talking about?\n\nOn the subject of electric cars, Harris has plenty to say.\n\n\u201cIf you feel that it is important to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, then stay with your gas-powered car.\u201d Ron Stein, a California engineer and the author of Clean Energy Exploitations, nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 2022, has performed a lifecycle analysis to show how much greenhouse gas is produced when you mine the cobalt and the various materials that are needed in electric vehicles, then ship them to China, then charge your car, then dispose of these highly toxic materials at the end of their life. \u201cHe found that the lifecycle analysis shows clearly that it increases greenhouse gases if you move over to electric vehicles. This is just one of the many scams that are out there. They\u2019re saying they\u2019re saving the planet, while actually, they\u2019re causing far more environmental damage,\u201d says Harris.\n\nFrom the Texas power failure in February 2021 that killed 700 people to the rolling power outages that a cold city like Ottawa can expect if the green plan is implemented, life will shortly become infinitely less comfortable. \u201cCatherine McKenney, who\u2019s a councillor right now and is the promoter of the fossil fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, endorsed energy evolution and the other plans. Ottawa at minus 30, you\u2019re going to see thousands of people die if we have a major power failure like they did. We\u2019re going to get a preview of it in Europe this winter because Europe has done two things, which are really going to make a lot of people very cold and hungry. Europe closed many of its most dependable power sources, nuclear, coal, oil.\u201d\n\nHarris endorses nuclear energy as clean and safe. \u201cYou have to realize that in the overall scheme of things, when you compare nuclear with coal or natural gas, there are actually far less accidents and far less people that are killed from anything to do with nuclear power. Nuclear power is probably the safest energy source on the planet.\n\n\u201cAll of this doom and gloom, we hear from the city, there\u2019s a climate emergency; where is it? Not here now? Do you know what it\u2019s based on? It\u2019s based on computer models.\u201d That\u2019s all it\u2019s based on.\n\nClimate scientists use computer models to forecast what they think the climate will be in 50 or 100 years. The climate scare is not based on what\u2019s happening in the real world. So, what is it that\u2019s driving the climate scare? \u201cThere are a lot of vested interests,\u201d says Harris. \u201cWorld government, they want to have massive profits for the wind and solar sector. They want to take away a lot of our freedoms.\u201d\n\nHow good are the models at forecasting climate if we use what we already know? Pretty poor is the answer. \u201cIf we go 30 years into the past, and we plug in the conditions that we know existed, temperature, density, pressure, all that sort of thing, and we run computer models to the present, do we get today\u2019s conditions?\u201d Not so much.\n\nThey call it hindcasting, in contrast to forecasting. Hindcasting shows the temperature rise in the last 30 years should be three times higher than it actually is. \u201cThey\u2019re off by 200 percent,\u201d says Harris. \u201cAnd yet, those are the models that are being used by the UN, by the climate activists by the governments, by the City of Ottawa, they\u2019re relying on these models that have massively failed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris, not one of the scientists\u2019 ideas about climate change is right. Which begs the question \u2013 where are all the scientists who disagree with this? \u201cThey\u2019re all over the place; at Ottawa University, we have Ian Clark, and at Carleton University, my mentor Tim Patterson and Fred Michael. These people are local, but they\u2019re not covered by the media.\n\nWe\u2019re not government funded, so we\u2019re allowed to deal with the truth.\u201d\n\nFrom global warming to alternative energy sources, it\u2019s all one big hoax, says Harris. \u201cIf you really want to kill this, you know, you must go after the science. Because if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s death by 1000 cuts.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Deadly globalist scam: \u2018Global warming to alternative energy sources, it\u2019s all one big hoax\u2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pollution.news/2022-10-06-global-warming-alternative-energy-sources-big-hoax.html", "site_name": "Pollution News", "description": "\u201cWorld government wants massive profits for the wind and solar sector.
