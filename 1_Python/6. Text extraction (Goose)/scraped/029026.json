Then, in 12th-century Moorish Spain the Arabic physician, surgeon, and poet Ibn Zuhr (Latin: Avenzoar) practiced dissection and surgical procedures on animals before applying them to human patients.\n\nAgain, in Spain, researchers from the Murcia Catholic University (UCAM) and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (SIBS) in the US (founded in 1960 by Jonas Salk, the developer of the polio vaccine) \u201c genetically modified monkey embryos\u201d and have successfully created a HUMAN-MONKEY embryo.\n\nA report in RT says the team of scientists, led by Juan Carlos Izpis\u00faa, relocated to China to conduct the experiment because it was \u201cin violation of Spanish law\u201d. These modern Dr. Frankensteins tinkered with the very building blocks of organic life and firstly they \u201cdeactivated specific genes used in the formation of organs\u201d before injecting \u201c human stem cells into the embryo\u201d.\n\nScientists injected human stem cells into the monkey embryo to create the animal-human hybrid. ( freshidea / Adobe Stock)\n\nIf left to evolve \u2018naturally\u2019 the embryo would quickly have grown into a monkey with human cells ; but adhering to \u2018ethical standards\u2019 the plug was pulled on the whole process long before the embryo began developing a central nervous system . The Spanish daily El Pais quoted Estrella N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who collaborated on the project, as saying \u201cthe results are very promising\u2026 a necessary first step towards developing human organs in animals that could be used in transplants\u201d.\n\nIt seems like only yesterday scientists at Scotland\u2019s Roslin Institute created their \u2018specialized\u2019 cell and made a whole new animal, but it was way back in the 5th of July 1996 that \u2018 Dolly the Sheep \u2019 was born. This Roslin Institute report details the work of Professor Sir Ian Wilmut and his team who cloned Dolly from a \u2018 mammary gland cell\u2019 taken from a six-year-old Finn Dorset sheep and an egg cell taken from a Scottish Blackface sheep. Incidentally, the report discloses that because Dolly\u2019s DNA had come from a mammary gland cell this is why she was named \u201cafter the country singer Dolly Parton\u201d.\n\nThe cloning process that produced Dolly the Sheep. (Magnus Manske / Public Domain )\n\nSince Dolly\u2019s first bahh, the world has been divided on the ethical issues associated with animal testing and in researching these arguments one quickly realizes that both factions readily throw scientific studies and contradictory \u2018hard\u2019 facts back and forth. But as a base-line to help you understand the perimeters of this problem a May 2017 article published on animal testing on ProCon says \u201can estimated 26 million animals are \u2018used\u2019 every year in the United States for scientific and commercial testing\u201d mostly to determine the toxicity of developing medical treatments for humans.\n\nProponents of animal testing often say research on living animals has been practiced since at least 500 BC and gives us life-saving treatments and that there is no viable alternative to studying complete living organisms. They might throw down this 2017 California Biomedical Research Association paper that states \u201cnearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals\u201d.\n\u2022 1,400-year-old medicinal treatise of Galen found hidden under hymns in ancient manuscript\n\nOpponents of animal testing say that it\u2019s inhumane and cruel to experiment on animals and that alternative methods \u2018are\u2019 available to researchers. Their academic armory might fire off this extensive 2012 Humane Society International study that demonstrated animals were commonly subjected to \u201cforce feeding, forced inhalation, food and water deprivation, prolonged periods of physical restraint, the infliction of burns and other wounds to study the healing process, the infliction of pain to study its effects and remedies, and killing by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, neck-breaking, decapitation, or other means\u201d.\n\nWhere Exactly Are \u2018We\u2019 With Creating Hybrid Animal-Humans?\n\nIn 2017 the same team that have now produced a human-monkey embryo attempted to brew-up a \u201c human and pig chimera \u201d and when this experiment failed they subsequently succeeded in creating hybrid chimeras between a rat and a mouse. An example of an answer as to \u2018why\u2019 scientists are making human-monkey chimera\u2019s might be Dr. Douglas Munoz of Queen\u2019s University\u2019s breakthrough study on the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans, derived from data gathered by injecting monkeys with proteins.\n\nBut a good argument for the danger of \u2018uncontrolled\u2019 tests of this kind, and why this could all go terribly wrong, is discussed in this Earth.com article that refers to \u201ca resource guide on the ethics of chimeras\u201d written by Yale University researchers suggesting \u201cthat it is time to \u2018cautiously\u2019 explore the creation of human-monkey chimeras\u201d. Dr. Munoz himself told the National Post in July that the \u201cprospect of humanizing animal brains is disturbing to him\u201d and he concluded \u201cfor us to start to manipulate life functions in this kind of way without fully knowing how to turn it off, or stop it if something goes awry really scares me\u201d. \n\nDoesn\u2019t Dr. Munoz sound like a computational scientist speculating about the potential catastrophes of uncontrolled testing of AI? It seems like we humans are destined, possibly hell-bound to create something that is part us, but much more than us, whether we want to or not.\n\nTop image: On Left - Young chimpanzee.
