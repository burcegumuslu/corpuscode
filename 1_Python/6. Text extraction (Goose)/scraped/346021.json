I don\u2019t think there will be any reason to introduce Dr. Malone to most of us here. Uh, uh, especially after the Joe Rogan podcast where I, my latest figure was something like 50 million listeners. [00:00:57] Um, that was a wonderful event, um, and reached an amazing amount of people. A man with a great mind, a deep scientific knowledge and an open heart. Dr. Robert Malone is the inventor of the nine original mRNA vaccine patents, which were originally filed in 1989, including both the idea of mRNA vaccines and the original proof of principle experience and RNA transfaction. [00:01:20] Dr. Malone has close to a hundred peer reviewed publications, which have been cited over 12,000 times. Since January 2020, Dr. Malone has been leading a large team focused on clinical research, design, drug development, computer modeling, and mechanisms of action for repurpose drugs of the treatment of COVID-19. [00:01:40] There are lots of things to add, but, um, as we are shorten on time as always, um, I\u2019ll hand over to you, Dr. Malone, and thank you very much for joining us tonight. [00:01:52] Dr. Robert Malone: Thank you very much for the opportunity. An honor to present here to your growing, amazing organization. I know you have a big dreams of, for supplanting, some other non-governmental organizations that have become dysfunctional, and we\u2019ll just leave it at that. [00:02:08] I\u2019m really heartened to see the growth in professionalism of the team that you guys have put together and in the broader community. So thank you for the opportunity to share this with you. The goal here is not to, uh, uh, uh, I come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him. Uh, no, I, I come here to share information, which I hope will help people to get over some of the fear and trepidation that they often seem to have as they encounter this new technology. [00:02:43] So this is intended to be a non-biased presentation of, of the tech, so that folks can better understand what we\u2019re talking about and be less prone to fear and, um, misunderstandings, uh, regarding the technology, uh, in particular, I think that we all are, are best served if we understand what we\u2019re talking about, and we\u2019re not, uh, focusing on red herrings or other things that [00:03:15] can distract us from, from our mission. So if we can move to the, oh, I should say, I need to put in the caveats. I serve as the president of the global COVID summit. That\u2019s the international Alliance of physicians and medical scientists, where we have a validated list of members that\u2019s over 17,000, uh, uh, sorry, uh, Thompson writers. [00:03:39] And, I also serve as the chief medical and regulatory officer of the unity project based in California. Unity project can be found as I showed on that first slide: unityprojectonline.com and we\u2019re the mission of that organization is to block the imposition of these illegal mandates for children, uh, to, uh, be required to receive these experimental medical products. Illegal in my opinion, in any case. [00:04:08] So then moving to that first slide, the central dogma of biology. So it\u2019s a diverse audience and I apologize to the physician scientists here, that I\u2019m having to drag through this, but for the rest of us, the central dogma of biology is kind of at the root of understanding this technology. [00:04:26] And that is that DNA makes RNA and RNA makes protein. Simple stuff. And traditionally, we always thought, we often think, of the double stranded molecule DNA as the one that encodes the genetic information that makes us who we are. In the case of RNA viruses, their genome is encoded on RNA. And of course the SARS cov two is a RNA virus. [00:04:51] So there is an enzyme associated with retroviruses, which can enable RNA to be used to produce DNA. That\u2019s called reverse transcriptase. And that\u2019s a hot topic for people that are concerned about the potential mutagenic effects of delivering mRNA into their cells. But I\u2019m not going to talk further about that at this point. [00:05:17] So I\u2019m going to kind of work you from left to right. First off on the left-hand panel. What we\u2019re showing there left-hand panel in the far right panel is kind of an enlargement of that. There are many forms of RNA. RNA is ribonucleic acid that\u2019s, it\u2019s just an acronym. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid. There are various functional forms of RNA. [00:05:46] One of those is to serve as a message. You can think of it as akin to a ticker tape, if you\u2019re old as me, many people won\u2019t remember that. You can think of it as akin to a Pearl necklace with, uh, each bead having a bit of information, but unlike in computers that, we\u2019re familiar with binary computers, uh, instead of only zeros and ones, we have four different bases. [00:06:11] A UGC in the case of RNA. RNAs can be used for different things. And they\u2019re used by the cell for different things. One of them is to serve as a scaffold in a sense, uh, with some catalytic components for the ribosome, which is this little cellular machine that, uh, produces proteins. One of them is to the transfer RNA, [00:06:38] so that\u2019s ribosomal RNA, or R RNA. One is to serve as a movable scaffold. That carries amino acids into the ribosome, and allows through base pairing the linkage of the appropriate amino acid based on the code that\u2019s in the messenger RNA. So those are called transfer RNAs cause they transfer amino acids. [00:07:05] So that\u2019s tRNA. And then there is the ribonucleic acid that has a message that instructs this whole symphony as to how to make a protein. And that\u2019s the messenger RNA. So first off we don\u2019t need to be afraid of, of this acronym, mRNA. It\u2019s nothing spooky or mysterious. It\u2019s merely an acronym for messenger RNA, which is one of the various forms that RNA takes. [00:07:31] Now we\u2019re going to move on to the structure of the virus itself and a couple of key components. This is a very simplified schematic, but it\u2019s useful. We have here highlighted the spike protein, and many of us are familiar with this. And now Moderna in the United States, as of today, has a license for producing spike vax, a vaccine, a mRNA vaccine which causes your cells to make spike protein. [00:08:00] So spike protein, as you can see from the schematic has various structural elements, including the receptor binding domain, which is the business end that enables the virus to attach to Ace2. But it\u2019s not the only protein. There\u2019s many other proteins associated with the virus. Both in the viral particles, [00:08:20] and when expressed, is included in envelope matrix nuclear capsid, proteins. And so you can see in this schematic, you know, roughly where they set the viruses envelopes. So it acquires lipids, uh, fats from the surface of your cells when it\u2019s produced. And, it has the mRNA condensed. Here it\u2019s shown as, uh, akin to a helix, such as is formed with DNA. [00:08:51] That\u2019s a very inaccurate representation of, of what the mRNA looks like, when it\u2019s from the virus, when it\u2019s bound to nucleocapsid protein. But this is a rough approximation to help people understand the basics. Okay. This is the hardest of these slides to walk through and understand, but this is the real business part of the mRNA vaccine technology or mRNA delivery technology. [00:09:20] And so there\u2019s three panels here. And since I\u2019m speaking to Canadians, I want to give a shout out to university of British Columbia and that group there that has really led in the development of the specific lipid structures that have a nitrogen with three carbons on them. That\u2019s a tertiary mean as opposed to the ones that I used for the original inventions, and then subsequently developed further during the nineties, which are all quaternary amines. They have four different carbons on the nitrogen. [00:09:57] The significance of that nitrogen is that it carries a positive charge, depending in the case of the, um, Peter cholas UBC, uh, technology that is a pH sensitive, positive charge. So it changes from a neutral to positive, depending on the surrounding pH in which it\u2019s placed the, the diluid. Um, or the cellular fluid. In the case of the original work that I did, we used a quaternary amine [00:10:29] that\u2019s always positively charged. This seems to be a significant advance that\u2019s enabled the, uh, activity of these particles in animals. So what you see in this panel in the upper right, is a series of these various catatonic lipids, positively charged fats that are synthetic. They are not normally found in your body. [00:10:52] These are drugs, and, uh, they are membrane active. They insert themselves into your cellular membranes as part of the process that results in the RNA being transferred into your cells so that it can then be loaded onto ribosomes and used to produce protein, like we were just talking about in their prior slide. [00:11:16] So these are examples of these lipid structures. If you\u2019re not familiar with organic chemistry, it\u2019s probably kind of jibberish, but, uh, what matters is that these have been empirically designed. You can\u2019t go to a computer modeling program and punch in: I want a canonic lipid that will target the liver. [00:11:38] For instance, these are, are produced synthetically by organic chemists, purified and then formulated with RNA and tested in various ways. So these are the ionizable lipids. If you look at the left part of that panel, uh, in the schematic and they\u2019re either ionizable or in the original embodiment, they were, uh, always positively charged. [00:12:02] Now, you\u2019ll see in that left-hand panel of the helper. Phospholipid this is typically polyethylene glycol. Um, uh, I\u2019m sorry. Uh, this is a dialell, dialellell, Pollic D-O-P-E. Um, uh ethanolamine uh, and this is, these are lipids that when, when formulated with other lipids help form a lipids, uh, layer and are intrinsically fusogentic. That means that when the particles come in contact with your cells, the membranes from the particles will fuse with the membranes of your cells. [00:12:42] So, finally, I\u2019ve got it: dialale phosphatidyl ethanolamine, or D-O-P-E, is a typical helper phospholipid. Then in the left, you\u2019ll look below that. It says cholesterol. Cholesterol are often included in these formulations and in these ones that are being used for the vaccines, because it increases the fluidity of the membrane [00:13:03] that\u2019s used to wrap the RNA. Then you see in that schematic, the MRN, and then below that is a key component that often people are confused about, lipid polyethylene glycol. So what\u2019s happened here. Polyethylene glycol is used to create, basically, structure the water around these particles. So in a sense, it\u2019s a little bit more like ice, but it\u2019s a very slippery ice. That helps keep liposomes, uh, polyethylene glycol can be used to keep liposomes from being cleared in the liver so they can circulate for a long period of time. [00:13:43] But in the case of these formulations, we have a very short, uh, carbon side chain on the polyethylene glycol, such that it is able to anchor into the formulation but it becomes disassociated upon injections. So for those patients, that experience, uh, the, um, acute anaphylaxis associated with, uh, administration, sometimes that\u2019s associated with this polyethylene glycol component. [00:14:11] Some people are sensitive to that. It\u2019s used in many different foods. It\u2019s generally considered to be, uh, safe. It\u2019s used in other liposome formulations like Doxil, uh, for cancer treatments, et cetera. But in the case of these formulations, the reason it\u2019s in there is because these complexes will aggregate quickly upon addition of the diluent. [00:14:38] The way these are prepared is the vials are shipped in a form, uh, that they\u2019re not ready for injection. And then you have to add a saline mixture and then resuspend them, and then use them within a fairly short period of time. If you don\u2019t do that, they aggregate, which is not a good thing for your patients because they form a large complexes that are both less active in delivering the RNA and more inflamatory. [00:15:09] So they can cause more side effects. So the lipid peg is in there to stop that aggregation process, but it isn\u2019t firmly anchored into the particle. And so it can fall off and you can get aggregates. So that\u2019s the key components of the formulation. And you can see in the schematic as a rough approximation. What happens is the RNA is negatively charged. [00:15:35] Remember I used the metaphor, it\u2019s like a string of pearls and you can think of this, the rope in between each Pearl is negatively charged. And then these lipids are positively charged. So they\u2019re driven to associate with each other, just like magnets, uh, positive and negative pole. We call it, um, ionic interactions. [00:15:55] And so when you make these mixtures, the RNA gets coated with the positively charged molecules, lipids, fats, and then those become aggregated and associated into particles. And the size of those particles are controlled through the formulation process. You can use various technology, including basically pushing the mixture through a very small orifice, which is why there\u2019s pumps involved in producing these final formulations. [00:16:27] And that gives rise to the final product that\u2019s injected into yourself or your patients. In the lower left panel, there\u2019s some additional nuance here that some people, for instance, one of the scientists testifying at the recent Ron Johnson hearing, got a little crossed up over because he didn\u2019t understand some of these fundamentals. [00:16:46] So in the upper part of that left lower panel, you see a colored strand labeled mRNA, and it has various components, a cap, the five prime UTR, a coding region, or, or open reading frame, a three-prime UTR and the poly a tail. For those that are not, you know, haven\u2019t spent their life obsessing over these things, [00:17:09] this all seems rather mysterious. I\u2019m going to walk you through what it is so that you, that kind of mystery is, is demystified for you. The cap at one end of the RNA, that\u2019s the five-prime end of the RNA, is where the ribosome gets loaded. Remember we talked about ribosomes before. So the ribosome in order to get loaded onto the RNA or vice versa, depending on how you look at it, requires a, a special chemical modified nucleotide that we call the cap. [00:17:41] And that cap also protects that end of the RNA from, uh, enzymes that would chew it up, like Pac-Man from the end. That cap is followed by a stretch of RNA called the five prime untranslated region, which function is still not completely understood, but it\u2019s known empirically that these five prime untranslated regions are essential for efficient production of protein off of a mRNA. [00:18:09] And this was one of the things that I demonstrated in my original paper. This is followed by the coding region or open reading frame. And just to say it, although, uh, the Pfizer dossier, that Biram originally captured from the Japanese regulatory authority, uh, in codes, the luciferase protein, which is a protein that makes the Firefly tail glow. [00:18:36] It has nothing to do with the devil. In the case of the, in Pfizer was allowed to use that as a surrogate for the vaccine, uh, actual vaccine product. In the vaccine product the open reading frame is what we call code on ma optimized so that it is engineered to produce as efficiently as possible [00:19:00] the spike protein and it\u2019s actually a modified version of spike protein. We\u2019ll go into that in a minute. The three prime untranslated region is also important and seems to interact with the five prime untranslated region in ways that aren\u2019t completely understood, but in order to have efficient translation into protein of these mRNA sequences, optimized three prime untranslated region is necessary. [00:19:24] That\u2019s also involved in stabilizing the RNA. And then this is followed by the poly adenyla tail, poly (A) tail. The poly (A) tail is kind of like a fuse that controls how long the RNA stays in the cell. Now that\u2019s a caveat that\u2019s in the normal situation. In the case of the marketed vaccines that we have in north America, the, uh, use uricells or uridines that are present in the mRNA naturally have been substituted for modified chemical compound called pseudo uridine. [00:20:01] And we really don\u2019t know a whole lot about the stability of those in your own cells. So when you ask me the question, how long does the RNA stick around after it\u2019s been delivered? I have to give you the \u201cduh\u201d I don\u2019t know, because I haven\u2019t seen any papers that document that response. So now we\u2019ve walked through the structure of the RNA, and then below that, in that panel, you can see a schematic that\u2019s really, uh, quite crude, showing the RNA sitting within one of these lipids, uh, um, the secular complexes with polyethylene glycol and its surface. [00:20:37] That\u2019s really quite crude. On the lower right, is a better approximation in which we have the RNA coded by the positively charged lipids. And then those aggregates coated by more, uh, membrane lipids that include the polyethylene glycol on their surface. So that\u2019s a closer approximation, but these are, when you hear about the lipid nano particles, uh, this is what we\u2019re talking about, and yes, they are typically highly inflammatory. [00:21:05] And that\u2019s been known for decades. Actually when I first met Katie Carrico, it was at a meeting that I had organized where I first disclosed, uh, how highly inflammatory these complexes are. The next slide: Intended Biodistribution. So the nuance here is that in the literature, based on rodent studies, there was a belief that, remember I showed you those different lipid structures, that the different lipid structures would confer targeting to different tissue sites, um, bone marrow liver, uh, and draining lymph nodes, for example, and the lipids that were chosen for these formulations were believed to have characteristics not really understood, but functionally determined that led to the RNA complexes, moving to the draining lymph nodes and delivering the RNA into antigen presenting cells in those draining lymph nodes. [00:22:03] So it was believed that this was going to be a safe process where the mRNA vaccine composed of the, that we\u2019ve described the structure of, would be injected, and then it would drain to those lymph nodes. It would not go all over the body and it would elicit an immune response in those lymph nodes by educating B and T cells. [00:22:23] Unfortunately, that turns out not to be the case. And, we learned that through the, again, the Pfizer dossier, that Byron Bridle kindly shared with the world. So he\u2019s a hero as far as I\u2019m concerned. And another thing that Canadians should be proud of, uh, but that was the belief system when this was presented to the FDA and the regulatory authorities, but then the data, limited data, that was generated in road models demonstrated that that absolutely was not the case. [00:22:52] So that had been, uh, proposed to be a safety feature, but I wanted to help you to understand that, just because that things, these things empirically behave that way in mice doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to behave that way in humans. And that seems to be the case here. I hope you\u2019re all still with me and I haven\u2019t put you to sleep yet with this very academic presentation. [00:23:13] This panel shows the graphic of a very simplified version of what happens with these particles. The graphic kind of flows from the upper left and then in an arc through to the upper right and center. Starting at the upper left, you have a schematic, the simplified schematic of these RNA lipid complexes, and they\u2019re typically formulated so that they have an excess positive charge. [00:23:41] Remember I said, the fats, the synthetic fats are positively charged at, uh, the pH is that are, um, exist outside of a cell. And, uh, so what happens is that cell membranes are generally negative. These are generally positive. And so once again, they\u2019re driven to associate by ionic interactions like two magnets and they glom onto your cell membranes. [00:24:08] And once they do that, those fusogentic and lipids like the, uh, dialayolel phosphatidyl ethanolamine that I mentioned, uh, as well as the candidate Libin structures cause these to fuse and, um, become integrated into the cell membrane of the cell that the particle has, has hit. So then the synthetic lipids become part of that cell\u2019s outer membrane, and the RNA is, is released or disgorged through a process. It\u2019s not really fully understood. [00:24:40] It becomes unpacked from these lipids and then, uh, gets transported to the ribosome. I\u2019m not aware. There\u2019s discussion about, since some of the untranslated regions are derived from sequences are related to sequences involved in, um, mitochondria there\u2019s discussion that maybe they\u2019re being producing protein, spike protein in mitochondria. [00:25:04] I\u2019m not aware of mRNA targeting sequences that would cause that to happen. I think that\u2019s another red herring, but I, you know, I haven\u2019t seen the data one way or another about that. In any case, they do find their ways to the ribosomes that are typically arrayed along this structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. [00:25:26] And then are, as I mentioned before, they are used to produce proteins. Those proteins are spike protein that are inserted into the Lumina of the ER. And then that\u2019s processed through the golgi apparatus where, uh, sugars are added and other things. And then once it\u2019s produced in the golgi and processed, then those spike proteins have one of two pathways. [00:25:51] They can end up being inserted onto the membrane of the cell that is transfected as a whole protein. And then they become targets for immune response, potentially, and also can be involved in educating B and T-cells to do their business, or they can be cut up into fragments. There are, uh, proteases in the cell and virtually every protein that\u2019s produced in the cell gets cut up into little tiny pieces and displayed on class one and/or class two major histocompatibility complex molecules, which by the way, are highly variable in humans. [00:26:27] This is a good thing that we have diversity in humans and diversity in our immune response. Those that interact with T cells and are involved in the T education program that, that produces finally T affector cells like cytotoxic, T lymphocytes. There, we got through that, um, that was a mouthful of immunology. [00:26:49] This is just another, kind of, easier version. It\u2019s looking at the system at kind of a higher level. The cell with all of the little blebs and podocytes sticking out of it, is a crude approximation of an antigen presenting cell. There\u2019s various types of cells that produce antigen and present it in educate T and B cells. [00:27:12] Dendritic cells are among the more potent of those, uh, monocytes and other macrophage can also do this. And there are some more fibroblasts like cells in lymph nodes that do this. So the thesis for this mechanism of action is that the RNA lipid protein complexes, I shouldn\u2019t say, lipid nano particles interact with entered and presenting cells and transfect, or produce the protein, deliver the RNA and produce the protein and those cells. That is a gross over simplification. [00:27:44] That happens to some extent, but these particles also produce protein in a variety of other cells in your body. And we know that to be true, both from multiple research papers over the last 30 years, but also, uh, functionally with, again, the, uh, documents that Biram obtained from Pfizer. Uh, by the Japanese, but in theory, the protein is produced on these antigen presenting cells. [00:28:13] And then they educate both CD eight cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD four helpers and B cells, and activate those to differentiate in the case of B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. In the case of T-cells, they produce effector T cells that are able to kill infected cells. It\u2019s important to remember that this virus doesn\u2019t just spread in an extracellular fashion, but it also spreads directly from cell to cell by a membrane fusion event. [00:28:46] So once a single cell is infected in your body, then the virus spreads laterally across adjacent cells. It doesn\u2019t have to get outside of a cell and therefore when it\u2019s spreading laterally, it\u2019s really not so susceptible to antibody interactions and blocking. Important also is that this process of B and T activation results in a population of memory cells that get parked and are able to be reactivated [00:29:18] if you encounter a similar pathogen in the future. Now that\u2019s important. We\u2019ll talk about that in a minute. When we talk about original antigenic sin. So with this slide, I\u2019m just emphasizing that in addition to the mRNA technology, we have another technology that\u2019s licensed in various Western countries, and the former Soviet union Russia has its own version of this tech. [00:29:45] This is the use of a cold virus, which happens to be a DNA virus. It\u2019s called an adenovirus. We\u2019ve all been infected by adenoviruses previously. Just like we\u2019ve all had a common beta Corona viruses infecting us. Adenoviruses, as I mentioned, are DNA viruses and what\u2019s done is to, uh, cut out sequences from those DNA viruses replace the spike protein into that DNA, and then use these to infect your cells rather than the synthetic lipid nanoparticles. [00:30:21] What matters here is that since it\u2019s a DNA virus, the DNA does go into your nucleus. And this technology was designed originally for gene therapy purposes. And so it produces protein at a high level for a long period of time. Again, I haven\u2019t been aware of any regulatory documents that have defined exactly where these adenoviruses go and for how long they produce the protein and how much spike protein is produced. [00:30:50] But that\u2019s the tech. It\u2019s otherwise very similar. It\u2019s just a different platform for delivering the genetic information, encoding the modified spike protein. Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about what that spike protein is. I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of being fact-checked by Thomson Reuters repeatedly over these topics. [00:31:11] The spike protein that is produced in these vaccines is a modified spike protein. It has two proline amino acids substitutions. They\u2019re in the S2 region, which is down the lower part. If you think of that tail, that sticking at the bottom in the lower panel which anchors the spike protein into the membrane of cells and this two proline mutations, I\u2019m sorry Reuters, were not introduced to make this less toxic. [00:31:43] They were introduced to make it more immunogenic. And what those two proline mutations do is to make it so that the spike stays locked into a pre fusion confirmation. So it is not able in theory to trigger the fusion between cells that normally would happen with the viral infection or with the cell, the cell spread. [00:32:08] These were not introduced to make it less toxic. Various mechanisms are involved in the toxicity as spike protein. Again, I apologize Reuters, but, uh, the sciences, the science, um, and, uh, one of those mechanisms of action is that spike binds to this key regulatory protein called ACE two. It\u2019s involved in regulation of blood pressure and many other things. [00:32:35] Receptor binding domain of spike remains intact and the rest of the core component of spike, it\u2019s only two amino acid changes that are introduced. And, fairly large protein, globular protein, and the receptor binding domain remains intact, which means it\u2019s still as able to bind to ACE two, the vaccine spike as the native spike. [00:33:03] And so any of those toxicities that are associated with that binding to ACE two in triggering ACE two activation remain with the spike encoded from either the virus or the vaccine. An important topic, I\u2019m just going to give you a sidebar on this, in terms of people ask, well, if, if you\u2019re getting spike from the vaccine and you\u2019re getting spike from the virus, what\u2019s the difference. [00:33:30] One key difference is that when you\u2019re infected by the virus, it\u2019s typically infecting the cells lining your nose and your mouth initially. And then it may migrate down into your lower lungs, although much less so with Omicron. It stays in your upper airway predominantly, which is a good thing. But what happens is you\u2019re initially infected by a small number of particles and they gradually spread and you have a gradual increase in the level of spike protein that your body is experiencing. [00:34:01] And of course at the same time, your body is mounting an immune response and spinning up its capabilities. So there\u2019s kind of a dance occurring between your immune system and the virus that results in a gradual escalation of the level of spike with infection and a gradual escalation of your immune response. In the case of the mRNA or the Adenovirus vaccines, [00:34:26] what you\u2019re having is a large amount of this protein being produced in a tissue site that it normally would not be produced in. And then it\u2019s being released and circulating in your body. We know that because of the Harvard and Brigham and women\u2019s study and nurses early on in the outbreak, when the vaccines were first being tested, that showed that the cleaved free spike circulates in the blood for a very long period of time, upwards of a month in many patients that is detectable. [00:35:01] This requires a sensitive biomedical, uh, biochemical essay and it has limits of, of detection. So we\u2019ve talked a little bit about spike protein and its structure and the specific mutations that are incorporated for purposes of generating the vaccines. And then the last thing I want to mention about spike is, for those of you that are Fishermen or Fisher persons, I guess I should say, if you know the structure of a trouble hook, that you might use with the bass plug, I think I can talk to this with Canadians, or you\u2019re going and catching stripers, [00:35:39] you may be familiar with the trouble hook. Spike is a trimor of proteins and it assumes a similar formation. So in the lower right aspect of that lower panel that the arrow points to, you\u2019re looking at the top of the spike. You\u2019re looking down the barrel of spike and you can see it has these three lobes that stick out. [00:36:00] Those are akin to the three barbs on a trouble hook. And the difference between the kind of the, where the treble hook metaphor breaks down is that each of these three lobes that sticks out like that is actually on a hinge. It\u2019s flexible, and those are the receptor binding domain. So you can think of this as kind of a three lobed book structure that grabs onto the ACE two receptor when the virus hits your cells or when the free spike protein potentially hit SES two. [00:36:31] The thing I really like to emphasize with this panel is the size of the antibody relative to the size of the spike. And so if you look at that upper center panel, the part that\u2019s kind of pink and red, that\u2019s a space filling diagram of an antibody that is matched to the thing that it\u2019s touching, which is a space filling model of the spike protein. [00:36:56] So you can see that in terms of the size, if you\u2019re thinking that there\u2019s hundreds of antibodies that are binding to spike, that\u2019s just not possible because they\u2019re about the same size. So with any one spike protein, you might get one or a very small number of antibodies interacting with it. In the upper right panel, [00:37:16] what you see is a schematic that shows the receptor binding domain. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s highly colored with purple and yellow and green, and those are all identified antibody binding domains that will interfere with the ability of spike to bind to cells. There\u2019s another little antibody binding domain down near the bottom [00:37:36] that\u2019s in blue there. And that one is broadly neutralizing. So antibodies directed against that are likely to be active against Omicron or the original alpha variant, et cetera. Those are very difficult to generate. In many people they will not produce antibodies against that target because it\u2019s kind of hidden by the virus in terms of the structure. [00:38:00] In the left lower, we have a more colorized version showing, as we\u2019re looking down the barrel of spike or looking at it sideways. And in that middle lower panel, you can see what we call a ribbon diagram that shows that same thing. So we have these three lobes that stick out that include the receptor binding domains and this central channel that is associated with the triggering of the fusion events. [00:38:29] This I\u2019m getting now towards the end of the presentation, where it\u2019s slide 12 of 15 and here, we\u2019re talking a little bit about T cell immunity. What matters here. What I\u2019d like to emphasize is the schematic in the panel in the lower left, the immune response against associated the memory cells associated with people [00:38:56] that are not exposed to COVID, the SARS-CoV-2, but have been exposed to prior beta coronaviruses. So that\u2019s the virtually all of us, we all had preexisting immunity against various proteins that are listed here. Nonstructural spike in M proteins that are from an immune system basis. They\u2019re very similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. [00:39:23] And so we had memory cells from those prior infections. Remember I talked about memory cells. So those memory cells that were parked, when you first get exposed to COVID-19 virus, the SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease COVID-19, that causes those memory cells to expand and start producing effector cells. [00:39:46] And so initially in your infection, if you haven\u2019t been previously infected or have not received the vaccine, what you\u2019ll predominantly do is generate both B and T responses that are designed for a prior virus. And so they are partially effective, but really often act in a way that interferes with any new antibodies that might be more specific for SARS-CoV-2. [00:40:15] This is a phenomenon that\u2019s well-known in immunology and in your daily life, you all understand that the things that you\u2019ve been exposed to, the situations you\u2019ve been exposed to, will bias how you respond to new, um, new events. So for instance, just taking a slightly sardonic point of view, my having been exposed to a hostile press over the last two years has made it so that I\u2019m very wary about interacting with any reporters, for some reason. [00:40:46] And, uh, that might be a good thing, or it might be a bad thing. Maybe I would be interacting with a reporter that would have actually done a good job and been friendly. So our prior exposures can bias our future responses. And that\u2019s true of your immune system. If you understand that you now understand original antigenic sin, the antigens and viruses that you\u2019ve been exposed to previously will bias how you respond to things in the future. [00:41:16] And by the way, that\u2019s also true with a mismatched vaccine, which is what we have right now. You are immune to reporters now, uh, not completely free, but getting there. In the upper panel there, what you\u2019re seeing is an example, a schematic of the types of immune responses that are generated with natural immunity after exposure and infection by SARS-CoV-2. [00:41:40] And you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s demonstrating there that you get a broad immune response, both antibodies and effector T cells to a variety of different proteins. And this is one of the issues with the vaccines is that they\u2019re generating these genetic vaccines that we have will elicit both a T N N effector in antibody response, [00:42:03] but those responses are not mucosal because you\u2019re not encountering the antigen through your normal mucosal route. And, they are biased only towards the spike protein and they\u2019re biased towards the spike protein from a virus that\u2019s no longer circulating because they\u2019re mismatched vaccines. [00:42:26] So the combination of these effects and the problems with original antigenic sin, I believe are what\u2019s driving the poor durability of the vaccines. So that\u2019s a huge difference between the natural immunity and the vaccine induced immunity is the natural immunity as much broader, longer lasting and against many different antigens, as opposed to the single antigen. [00:42:50] Now I\u2019m trying to move quickly. I have just a couple more slides. The next slide emphasizes this point that the natural immunity is against up to fifty four different proteins, both nonstructural and structural. Whereas the vaccine immunity is against only one protein, the spike protein. Then the next panel is just kind of a wrap up of a key point that I believe strongly in. [00:43:18] And I believe there\u2019s over 140 references that support the thesis that natural immunity is more protective and more effective. And, you can find a very nice article about that in the brownstone Institute library of articles. I just wanted to emphasize here that, in my opinion, it is essential that we recognize that natural immunity is more effective, that we should give allowance for those that have recovered, which have better immune responses than those elicited by a mismatched vaccine. [00:43:55] They\u2019re more durable, more effective, less likely to be evaded by a viral evolution. And furthermore, those that have generated natural immunity are susceptible to greater numbers in a severity of adverse events if they are subjected to genetic vaccination after generating natural immunity. [00:44:18] So with that, I have sucked up, um, the better part of an hour, I guess. I apologize for that. Thank you for your time and attention. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to, uh, buzz out now. And I don\u2019t have time for questions because I have to go give testimony to a judge advocate general here, uh, on Hawaii about some of the issues associated with the licensure packages and the adverse events that have been observed with these vaccines. [00:44:45] But I hope this was helpful. And if, if it has resulted in you having less anxiety and about the technology and a better understanding, then I\u2019ve succeeded. [00:44:58] Dr. Kat Lindley: Thank you, Dr. Malone for your presentation. And if possible, we will email you some questions from you to maybe answer. We can send them over to affiliates and members to look over later. [00:45:10] Pierre Kory: Hi Kat, it\u2019s Pierre. [00:45:13] Dr. Kat Lindley: Hi Pierre, [00:45:13] thank you for coming in. [00:45:15] Pierre Kory: I\u2019m here on a Hawaii with Robert. We also have to give testimony. So I just wanted to, to just pop in and say a couple of words, is that okay? [00:45:24] Dr. Kat Lindley: Yes, please. Go ahead. [00:45:27] Pierre Kory: So I think I was asked to just talk about what\u2019s going on in Canada and the trucker\u2019s, um, I cannot believe what is going on. [00:45:38] I mean, I just love it. The truckers are showing up. They\u2019re making a splash. People are paying attention, but at the same time, the world has gone mad. The truckers are saving Canada, the collapsed, failed totalitarian state of Canada, and the truckers are showing up. I just love it. I think there\u2019s, there\u2019s, there\u2019s some plans to get a convoy of American truckers to meet them at the border. [00:45:59] And I hope that happens. Um, just, you know, you guys know me, I just, it\u2019s just absurd. I can\u2019t verify this, but I was told the other night that CNN, when they covered the convoy in Canada, they said that it was a protest against icy roads in Canada. Are you guys all laughing? Please laugh with me. They are protesting icy roads in Canada. [00:46:25] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: You\u2019re right. It was ridiculous. They weren\u2019t ready for it, right. [00:46:30] They weren\u2019t ready for this. [00:46:30] Pierre Kory: Hey Jennifer, I\u2019m so sorry about your icy roads in Canada. I\u2019d never knew such thing could happen. What, what a catastrophe, but I just wanted to say I\u2019m with you guys. You guys are the best. It\u2019s not just the truckers. It\u2019s the Canadian COVID care Alliance and it\u2019s a bunch of other groups and, and you know what, the pictures are as loud as words and maybe even louder. [00:46:53] And I just hope everyone keeps speaking up, speaking out and, uh, you know, we\u2019re here to do the same with all you guys. And so you have our full support, man. Uh, oh my gosh, Canada, Canada. You guys need our help, man. You\u2019re your worst than United States, but, uh, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll bring you along. We\u2019ll we\u2019ll bring it to the light. [00:47:14] Definitely. [00:47:16] Dr. Kat Lindley: Thank you for your message. And thank you for joining us and thank you again, Dr. Malone. I think he is still there and we will email him the questions and then post the answers to all of those questions. [00:47:30] Dr. Robert Malone: Thanks Kat. Um, be good and, uh, stay strong.
