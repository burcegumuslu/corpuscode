You may have heard about how cholesterol can accumulate in your arteries and put unnecessary strain on your heart.\n\nMost people rely on blood thinners and other medications (statins) to combat the effects of high cholesterol, but the condition can easily be managed by food alone.\n\nHigh cholesterol levels can lead to a buildup of plaque in the artery walls, narrowing the arteries, and causing a condition called atherosclerosis. this impairs blood flow throughout the body and increases risk of heart disease and stroke (1).\n\nThere exist two main types of cholesterol (2):\n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL): \u201cbad,\u201d cholesterol transports cholesterol particles throughout your body and builds up in the walls of your arteries, making them hard and narrow.\n\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL): \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol picks up excess cholesterol and takes it back to your liver to be cleared away through bile.\n\nHigh levels of LDL cholesterol is typically caused by smoking, poor diet, inactivity, diabetes and is linked to obesity. To put it simply, high cholesterol, in most cases, is simply a reflection of an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nWhen cholesterol is oxidized, it leads to a build-up of plaque in the artery walls, which hardens and narrows the arteries, and causes a condition called atherosclerosis.\n\nPlaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, cellular waste products and fibrin, that lodge inside our arterial walls and damage the cells that are already there, causing inflammation.\n\nWe now know that LDL cholesterol poses a health risk only if it is oxidized.\n\nOxidized cholesterol and oxidized fat are the real enemies. Our bodies treat these as foreign substances and stimulate inflammatory cytokines to damage and kill them with inflammation.\n\nThe fact that LDL cholesterol is highly prone to oxidation explains why a rise in LDL cholesterol normally brings about an increase in coronary artery disease risk.\n\nThe oxidized cholesterol that clogs our arteries and causes coronary artery disease stems from two sources:\n\nOne. We acquire some of them straight from our diets when we eat oxidized fats and oils.\n\nTwo. Our bodies produce the remainder internally.\n\nDietary oils and fats tend to become oxidized when they are heated, dried, aged, exposed to light, and otherwise chemically processed. A diet high in vegetable oils is unmistakably hazardous.\n\nA lesser-known fact is that sugar oxidizes as well as oils and fats do. Glucose, and especially fructose, produce many oxidation products when they are aged, heated, or otherwise processed.\n\nStudies have shown that people who are at serious risk of heart attacks to the extent that they need bypass surgery have high oxidized LDL cholesterol, not normal LDL cholesterol.\n\nLuckily, it\u2019s possible to get antioxidants from foods to neutralize free radicals and reverse the damage they cause to cells and organs.\n\nLet\u2019s get to our cholesterol-busting recipe with 3 natural ingredients.\n\nThis recipe provides your body with nutrients that can help break down bad cholesterol and clear your arteries as you transition into a healthier lifestyle.\n\u2022 Scrub lemons properly to clean the rind, but do not peel.\n\u2022 Slice lemon and peel the ginger and garlic.\n\u2022 Crush the garlic and let it sit for 15 minutes. This will activate the allicin.\n\u2022 Place everything but the water in a blender and pulse until smooth.\n\u2022 In a medium saucepan, add water and the paste and warm over medium heat.\n\u2022 Just as it begins to boil, remove the mixture from heat.\n\u2022 Let it cool and strain the liquid.\n\u2022 Pour the drink in glass jars or bottles with lids and store in the refrigerator.\n\nHow to Use:\n\nDrink daily on an empty stomach two hours before meals. Combine with exercise 3 times a week.\n\nGinger: Dried ginger powder administered at 0.1 g/kg of body weight limits the risk of atheroma (degeneration of the walls of the arteries caused by accumulated fatty deposits and scar tissue) by up to 50% in just 75 days (3).\n\nIt also prevent heart disease by inhibiting the accumulation of platelets in the arteries and inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis.\n\nAdditionally, it doesn\u2019t have the negative side effects of other medication such as aspirin.\n\nGarlic: Garlic is traditionally used to help prevent heart disease, including atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, which are risk factors for heart disease and stroke.\n\nIt also treats high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and boosts the immune system (4).\n\nOne study that lasted 4 years found that people who took 900 mg daily of standardized garlic powder slowed the development of atherosclerosis.\n\nIt also contains antioxidants which fight free radicals to prevent heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer disease.\n\nLemons: Daily lemon intake and walking showed significant effects on lowering blood pressure while also increasing red blood cell count (5). Lemon also helps detox the liver to help it clear excess cholesterol.", "opengraph": {"description": "A diet high in junk food and sugar can be destructive to your cardiovascular health.
