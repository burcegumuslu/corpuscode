Or when a shark attacks a swimmer?\n\nAnd it\u2019s in the FDA\u2019s nature to approve just about any pharmaceutical intervention that is thrown their direction, even if adverse reactions include death. Each year, more than 2.2 million Americans suffer serious adverse reactions from FDA-approved drugs, and the FDA openly admits that there are \u201cover 106,000 deaths annually\u201d due to adverse drug reactions from Big Pharma\u2019s drugs that the FDA has \u201capproved.\u201d\n\nFor example, Pfizer\u2019s drug Bextra was granted FDA approval in 2001. In 2005, the drug was recalled for adverse heart effects including death, heart attack, and stroke, as well as increased risk for serious skin reactions, such as epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Bextra also had the potential to cause gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nIn 2009 Bextra was at the center of the \u201clargest health care fraud settlement and the largest criminal fine of any kind ever.\u201d Pfizer paid a $2.3 billion civil and criminal fine. Pharmacia and Upjohn, a Pfizer subsidiary, violated the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for misbranding Bextra \u201cwith the intent to defraud or mislead.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve heard about Vioxx, right? According to Drugwatch, at the time of its recall in 2004, \u201cVioxx had been taken by some 4 million Americans. Out of those patients who took Vioxx, the arthritis drug may have caused approximately 140,000 heart attacks resulting in an estimated 60,000 deaths.\u201d\n\nWe could go on, but the point should be clear: The FDA routinely approves drugs that are later found to be unsafe, ineffective, and even deadly.\n\n\u201cWhy would the FDA approve these toxic, deadly drugs?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s why: It\u2019s called regulatory capture, which is a phenomenon that occurs when an allegedly \u201cobjective\u201d regulatory agency (like FDA) ends up \u201cpromoting\u201d the industries they are supposed to be \u201cregulating.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that the FDA has been captured for a long time. In a 2016 study published in the British Medical Journal, the majority of the FDA\u2019s hematology-oncology reviewers who left the agency ended up working or consulting for Big Pharma. In a 2018 investigation by Science magazine, 11 of 16 FDA reviewers who worked on over two dozen drug approvals and subsequently left the agency were working or consulting for the companies they recently regulated.\n\nFor 40 years, every single FDA commissioner has gone on to sit on the board of a Big Pharma company (except one). Scott Gotlieb, who served as commissioner from 2017-2019, now sits on Pfizer\u2019s board.\n\nJanet Woodcock was named Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs on January 20, 2021. If the name sounds familiar, yes this is the same woman who became director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in 1994, the year before the agency approved OxyContin. Woodcock presided over one of the worst regulatory agency failures in U.S. history as the opioid epidemic (fueled by the FDA\u2019s approval of dangerous drugs like OxyContin) ravaged our nation.\n\n\u201cThe FDA\u2019s approval of this vaccine is a milestone as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Woodcock, in a press release issued Monday. Woodcock was once considered a possible nominee for the permanent job of FDA Commissioner, despite resistance from numerous senators who sent a letter to the White House in March calling for new leadership at the FDA, citing its \u201clong track record approving dangerous opioids without considering public health.\u201d In addition to the senators, a coalition of nonprofit advocacy groups asserted that Woodcock\u2019s \u201cinadequate\u201d oversight of the FDA during the opioid crisis should disqualify her.\n\nIn a letter to officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, the coalition wrote:\n\nThe letter accused Woodcock of \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d for allowing opioid manufacturers to spend years disseminating false claims that narcotic painkillers were less addictive and more effective than they really were, contributing to the rise of mass opioid prescribing and spread of an epidemic that has claimed more than 500,000 lives.\n\nMore recently, the White House was dissatisfied over how the FDA under Dr. Woodcock handled the controversial approval of an Alzheimer\u2019s drug over objections of some staff members and members of an advisory committee.\n\nIn the case of Pfizer\u2019s latest FDA \u201capproval,\u201d there are more questions than answers. And those problems begin at the very top of the first page of the vaccine insert:\n\n\u201cCOMIRNATY is a vaccine indicated for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines protect people against severe illness\u201d but \u201cbreakthrough infections are expected. COVID-19 vaccines\u2026 are not 100% effective.\u201d\n\nWhy is the FDA granting approval for a drug designed to stop COVID-19 when we know for an absolute fact that it does not?\n\nThe insert also confirms that the safety of Comirnaty is based on only two studies. The first has a sample size of only 60 participants. And get this \u2026 the second study had over 44,000 participants, but participants in the placebo group were offered the jab in December 2020!\n\nThis means that the vast majority of those who received a saline placebo injection were TOLD THEY HAD RECEIVED A PLACEBO AND OFFERED THE REAL SHOT! Placebos don\u2019t work if you know you received a placebo, and control groups cease to be control groups when they\u2019re given the same drugs as the vaccine groups. In other words, there was no true placebo group.\n\nThis is science 101. And the information provided above is literally in the package insert for Pfizer\u2019s latest poison vaccine. Pfizer publicly admits that the study supporting the approval of the drug was RUINED.\n\nConspicuously, there has been no mention of the 13,608 deaths reported after administration of the COVID-19 shot. There have been more adverse events reported since these shots were released than in the 30 years prior. THIRTY YEARS!\n\nThe Pfizer jab, named \u201cComirnaty,\u201d is the first injection for COVID-19 to be granted full approval by the FDA. Officials hope that full approval will make it easier for employers, the military, and universities to mandate vaccination and that it will somehow persuade people (who have seen the shocking number of adverse events and deaths and who are hesitant about the vaccine) that it is \u201csafe and effective.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the military, just minutes after the FDA\u2019s announcement, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby announced that the military is now requiring soldiers to get the jab under threat of court martial.\n\nIn an article published August 20th in the British Medical Journal, the authors mention Kim Witczak, a drug safety advocate who serves as a consumer representative on the FDA\u2019s Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee, who is one of the more than 30 signatories of a citizen petition which called on the FDA to refrain from fully approving any COVID-19 vaccine to gather more data. She warned that without a [public FDA] meeting \u201cwe have no idea what the data looks like. It is already concerning that full approval is being based on 6 months\u2019 worth of data despite the clinical trials designed for two years. There is no control group after Pfizer offered the product to placebo participants before the trials were completed.\u201d\n\nApparently, the FDA ignored Ms. Witczak\u2019s warnings, even though she is a member of one of their advisory committees. Amidst a tsunami of reports of COVID-19 vaccine injuries and deaths from around the world, the FDA is proving it is an agency that will certify maiming and killing without hesitation.\n\nLast year the FDA said it was \u201ccommitted to use an advisory committee composed of independent experts to ensure deliberations about authorisation or licensure are transparent for the public.\u201d But in a letter to the British Medical Journal, the FDA said it did not believe a meeting was necessary ahead of the expected full FDA approval.\n\nAs vaccine pushers celebrate the approval, we have a question: \u201cHow can a vaccine be fully approved when we don\u2019t even know the optimal number of doses?\u201d\n\nWe have another question: \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem suspicious that Big Pharma provides 75% of the FDA\u2019s drug review budget?\u201d\n\nThe mantra of the MSM is that we should take the COVID-19 jab because \u201cexperts say they\u2019re safe and effective\u201d \u2026 but why do they never tell us to be vaccinated because \u201cthe data shows they\u2019re safe and effective\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Pfizer\u2019s stock value has increased by over 35% in the past year alone. BioNTech is up almost 400% in that same period. According to Yahoo! Finance, discussing Pfizer\u2019s soaring revenues, \u201cHigher sales of brands like Eliquis \u2026 and significant contribution from new drug Vyndaqel/Vyndamax \u2026 drove this segment\u2019s sales growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Eliquis?\u201d It\u2019s a Pfizer drug used to prevents blood clots. \u201cWhat\u2019s Vyndaquel/Vyndamax?\u201d It\u2019s a Pfizer drug used to treat cardiomyopathy. Surprise, surprise\u2026 blood clots and cardiomyopathy are two of the side effects of Pfizer\u2019s COVID jab! See how this works, folks? Follow the money!\n\n\n\nAs we already mentioned, with FDA approval, it will now be easier for schools, businesses, and the government to force vaccination. With COVID-19 boosters also set for approval, you can expect those numbers to increase.\n\nThese people are getting rich while Americans are injured and killed by an unsafe and untested vaccine that doesn\u2019t do the ONE THING it was approved to do. The FDA has a horrendous track record of approving dangerous and ineffective drugs \u2013 especially when they do it in a hurry. The double-blind, placebo-controlled study cited for approval is neither \u201cblind\u201d nor \u201cplacebo-controlled.\u201d\n\nSo much for the \u201cgold standard.\u201d This vaccine is a farce.\n\nNow that it\u2019s been approved by the FDA, you can expect the vaccine rhetoric and oppressive mandates to increase at an alarming rate. Even though the jab is still experimental. FDA approval does NOT mean that Pfizer\u2019s shot is no longer experimental. Every COVID jab, including Pfizer\u2019s, is less than a year in use and still experimental by definition. The fact is, Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials don\u2019t end until May 2023.\n\nHere\u2019s an excellent article titled \u201c10 reasons why the FDA approval for Pfizer jab isn\u2019t about health, but about forcing people to take the shot.\u201d Don\u2019t let yourself be a human guinea pig. We should all be prepared to stand up for our freedoms\u2026 before it\u2019s too late.\n\nWatch the video below of a brave Los Angeles Fire Captain (Christian Granucci) declaring that we are in tyranny and that he and his crew will not comply! This is powerful and moving!\n\nOh yeah, we almost forgot to mention that a recent investigation revealed that Bill Gates has major shares in both Pfizer & BioNTech, but we\u2019re sure that\u2019s just a \u201ccoincidence\u201d in this FDA decision\u2026\n\nOh yeah, we almost forgot this too. On August 17th, the CDC issued an alert of an expected outbreak of the polio-like disease (Acute Flaccid Myelitis) in the next four months. This is a serious neurological condition, which causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Hmmm \u2026 interesting that would mimic the predicted downstream effects of the COVID-19 jab right around that time, isn\u2019t it? Likely just another \u201ccoincidence\u201d though \u2026 totally unrelated\u2026 nothing to see here\u2026. move along sheep!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING:
