As you\u2019d expect of an organisation funded by the pharmaceutical companies and vaccine investors whose products it is paid to guarantee the safety of, the answer is an unsurprising \u2018no\u2019.\n\nAfter failing \u2014 or refusing \u2014 to differentiate between serious and non-serious adverse reactions to the fake \u2018vaccines\u2019 during the politically-declared coronavirus \u2018pandemic\u2019, at the end of December 2022 the MHRA finally published the figures that distinguish between them for each of the different brands of \u2018vaccines\u2019.\n\nAnd as we should by now expect of a privately-funded government body that has repeatedly and consistently lied to the UK public since March 2020, the data contradicts their own assertions. In this article, I\u2019m going to show how. It should be clear by now why they have lied.\n\nOf the 177,925 Yellow Card reports of 511,775 adverse drug reactions received after being injected with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA \u2018vaccine\u2019 by 23 November 2022, 71 per cent (125,711 reports) were categorised by the MHRA as \u2018serious\u2019.\n\nAnd rather than the \u2018sore arms, headaches and tiredness\u2019 described by the MHRA, these adverse reactions include 2,640 disorders of the immune system, 7,950 vascular disorders; 14,380 cardiac disorders; 17,670 blood disorders; 23,070 respiratory disorders; 31,790 reproductive system and breast disorders; 58,340 musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; and 84,730 disorders of the nervous system.\n\nAnd far from being the \u2018normal, expected, and coincidental\u2019 illnesses of an ageing demographic who just happened to be injected before suffering these symptoms, the serious adverse reactions were mostly in the young and healthy, with 65 per cent under the age of 50.\n\nOf the 246,866 Yellow Card reports of 874,912 adverse drug reactions after being injected with the AstraZeneca/Oxford viral-vector \u2018vaccine\u2019 by 23 November 2022, 77 per cent (190,997 reports) were categorised by the MHRA as \u2018serious\u2019.\n\nAgain, instead of the \u2018chills, fatigue and weakness\u2019 described by the MHRA, these adverse reactions include 3,481 disorders of the immune system; 14,078 vascular disorders; 11,599 cardiac disorders; 7,922 blood disorders; 23,070 respiratory disorders; 20,983 reproductive system and breast disorders; 105,331 musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; and 183,978 disorders of the nervous system.\n\nAnd, once again, rather than being reports by the ageing and infirm who coincidentally were injected with the AstraZeneca viral vector \u2018vaccine\u2019, 48 per cent of the reports of serious adverse reactions came from people under the age of 50.\n\nFinally, of the 47,045 Yellow Card reports of 151,628 adverse drug reactions received after being injected with the Moderna/NIH mRNA \u2018vaccine\u2019 by 23 November 2022, 72 per cent (33,896 reports) were categorised by the MHRA as \u2018serious\u2019.\n\nContrary what the MHRSA says, \u2018most\u2019 of these adverse reactions were not \u2018nausea, aching muscles and rapid heartbeat\u2019, but included 738 disorders of the immune system; 1,641 vascular disorders; 2,862 blood disorders; 5,438 reproductive system and breast disorders; 14,152 cardiac disorders; 17,071 musculoskeletal and tissue disorders; 23,070 respiratory disorders; and 24,861 disorders of the nervous system.\n\nAnd, once again, 65 per cent of the serious adverse reactions to the Moderna injections were reported by people under the age of 50, exactly the same percentage as for the Pfizer injection.\n\nThis isn\u2019t surprising, since both injections use the experimental messenger RNA platform to inject the COVID-19 spike protein, which doesn\u2019t stay in the injected muscle, but spreads throughout the body, causing the human immune system to attack its own cells.\n\nIncluding the 446 reports of serious adverse drug reactions to the Novavax injections and an unspecified brand of COVID-19 \u2018vaccine\u2019, this adds up to 351,050 reports of adverse reactions to the MHRA approved injections it has categorised as \u2018serious\u2019.\n\nHowever, since the MHRA, by its own admission, estimates that only 10 per cent of serious ADRS are reported to their office, a more accurate estimate is that the COVID-19 injections have caused over 3.5 million serious adverse reactions in the UK, leading not to sore arms and headaches but to permanent injury, ruined health, amputation of limbs and death.\n\nIndeed, according to the World Council for Health, the list of damages caused by the spike protein in the mRNA injections includes tissue and organ damage, damage to the lining of blood vessels, blood clotting and thrombosis, innate immune suppression, autoimmune disease, suppression of the body\u2019s interferon response to infection and disease, viral reactivation, inhibition of DNA repair, neurologic damage, mitochondrial damage, cardiac damage, narrowing of immune response for future coronaviruses, cells making spike proteins becoming the targets of antibodies, low sperm count, hormonal imbalance, and numerous contributors to cancer.\n\nAlmost none of these are mentioned in the MHRA\u2019s own comments on the safety of the COVID-19 \u2018vaccines\u2019.\n\nBut the MHRA reports that incidents of Bell\u2019s Palsy, which causes weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face, after being injected with a COVID-19 vaccine is \u2018rare\u2019. In medical terms, as established by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, this means there\u2019s between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 chance of this adverse reaction occurring.\n\nIt also reports that, as of October 2022, the MHRA had received 179 reports of transverse myelitis, an acute neurological disorder where parts of the spinal cord are inflamed: 129 after the AstraZeneca injection, 42 after Pfizer, and 8 after Moderna. The MHRA calls this \u2018extremely rare\u2019, or a less than 1 in 100,000 chance.\n\nAs of 23 November 2022, the MHRA had received 445 reports of thrombo-embolic events (blood clotting) with concurrent low platelets, of which 81 resulted in death, after injection with the AstraZeneca \u2018vaccine\u2019. And as for all the serious adverse events, these are not confined to the elderly and infirm, with 44 per cent of these events occurring in people under the age of 50.\n\nBy the same date, the MHRA had received 40,327 reports of 51,695 menstrual disorders and/or unexpected vaginal bleeding after injection with a COVID-19 \u2018vaccine\u2019. Despite this, the MHRA insists there is \u2018no link\u2019 to the injections.\n\nThe MHRA had also received, by the same date, 2,226 reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) or pericarditis (swelling of the tissue around the heart) after injection with COVID-19 \u2018vaccines\u2019: 1,361 after the Pfizer injections, 363 after the Moderna injections, and 472 after the AstraZeneca injections.\n\nIndicative of a causal connection to the injections, the proportionally fewer incidents of both from the AstraZeneca \u2018vaccine\u2019 are overwhelmingly (83 per cent) among those over 40 years of age, while the injections using the mRNA platform in the Pfizer and Moderna \u2018vaccines\u2019 causes myocarditis and pericarditis mostly in the young, with 58 per cent of heart inflammations occurring in those aged between under 39. Again, the MHRA dismisses these as \u2018very rare\u2019, or less than 1 in 10,000.\n\nAgain, as of 23 November, 2022, the MHRA has received 697 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome and the related Miller Fisher Syndrome, both of which cause inflammation of the nerves and can lead to numbness, weakness and pain, usually in the feet, hands and limbs, as well as spreading to the chest and face.\n\nFinally, the most serious adverse reaction to the COVID-19 \u2018vaccines\u2019 is death, of which the MHRA has received 2,362 reports: 857 after the Pfizer/BioNTech injection; 1,334 after the AstraZeneca/Oxford injection; 111 after the Moderna/NIH injection; and 60 after an unspecified brand.\n\nGiven the loneliness in which people have been isolated by anti-social distancing and the fear created around anyone displaying any symptoms of illness, how many deaths after injection with these experimental \u2018vaccines\u2019 have not been reported to the MHRA?\n\nShould we estimate that, as a serious adverse event, only 10 per cent of these have also been reported, and the real death toll from the UK \u2018vaccination\u2019 programme is therefore closer to 23,620? Certainly, this would better explain the increase in excess deaths not attributed to COVID-19 of those under 40 years of age in 2021 and 2022.\n\nOne of the less pleasant character-traits of the COVID-faithful is their arrogant, contemptuous and cruel dismissal of the more than 1.54 million reported adverse reactions to these experimental and demonstrably dangerous \u2018vaccines\u2019.\n\nBut whatever the true toll in injuries and deaths, when the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency responsible for guaranteeing their safety states that the \u2018overwhelming majority\u2019 of the 474,000 Yellow Card reports it has received of adverse reactions to the COVID-19 \u2018vaccines\u2019 are \u2018sore arms, headaches, chills, tiredness, feeling sick, dizziness, weakness and aching muscles\u2019, it is lying to the UK public \u2014 not only about the risks and dangers of being injected with this experimental biotechnology, but also about the seriousness of the consequences of doing so.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the corruption of UK Government and National Health Service by the international pharmaceutical companies and global investors funding them, and the consequences this is having for the health, freedom and lives of the British public, you may be interested in my new book, The Road to Fascism: For a Critique of the Global Biosecurity State, which is available in hardback, paperback and e-book.
