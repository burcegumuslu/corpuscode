Would these accounts not meet the bar for banning under your new strike system? \u2026 Welcoming any steer by the end of the day.\u201d\n\nMurphy named the following 12 entities as the worst \u201coffenders,\u201d from her point of view, in terms of misinformation spread:\n\nThe clear message from Murphy\u2019s correspondence is: delete these people or else. And that is exactly what Twitter did, with GreenMedInfo (run by Sayer Ji) losing its 13-year-old Twitter account just two weeks after Ji personally called out the CCDH for publishing a digital hit list with his name on it.\n\nCCDH\u2019s campaign to de-platform 12 American citizens based on \u201cfaulty narrative, without evidence\u201d\n\nIt turns out that the criteria the CCDH used to compile its \u201cdisinformation dozen\u201d digital hit list was based entirely on a faulty narrative that lacks any evidence of wrongdoing. Murphy, FT, and the CCDH simply identified popular people they do not like or agree with and falsely accused them of violating social media rules.\n\nIt was Aug. 18, 2021, when Facebook\u2019s VP of Content Policy revealed that the statistics used by the CCDH to compile its list were inaccurate by \u201can astronomical margin of 300 fold,\u201d to quote Ji.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that not a single retraction or correction from CCDH, a government agency, nor several thousand media outlets has occurred since this came to light,\u201d Ji writes.\n\nIt turns out that the CCDH and FT are just the tip of the iceberg. As discovered by four-time New York Times bestselling author and American journalist Matt Taibbi via the Twitter Files, there is actually a massive \u201ccensorship industrial complex,\u201d as he calls it, that includes the U.S. government, various non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the commercial media, all of which conspired with one another to deprive countless U.S. citizens of their First Amendment rights.\n\nJust a few days ago on March 9, Taibbi testified before the House Judiciary Committee about this vast censorship industrial complex during the Hearing on the Weaponization of the Federal Government on the Twitter Files.\n\n\u201cWe learned Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other companies developed a formal system for taking in moderation \u2018requests\u2019 from every corner of government: the FBI, DHS, HHS, DOD, the Global Engagement Center at State, even the CIA,\u201d Taibbi said.\n\n\u201cFor every government agency scanning Twitter, there were perhaps 20 quasi-private entities doing the same, including Stanford\u2019s Election Integrity Project, Newsguard, the Global Disinformation Index, and others, many taxpayer-funded.\u201d\n\nTaibbi went on to describe how this \u201cfast-growing network\u201d was keeping itself busy compiling lists of people whose opinions, beliefs, associations, and / or sympathies \u201care deemed \u2018misinformation,\u2019 \u2018disinformation,\u2019 \u2018or malinformation,'\u201d the latter term simply being a euphemism for \u201ctrue but inconvenient\u201d information.\n\n\u201cUndeniably, the making of such lists is a form of digital McCarthyism,\u201d Taibbi correctly pointed out.\n\n\u201cOrdinary Americans are not just being reported to Twitter for \u2018deamplification\u2019 or de-platforming, but to firms like PayPal, digital advertisers like Xandr, and crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe. These companies can and do refuse service to law-abiding people and businesses whose only crime is falling afoul of a distant, faceless, unaccountable, algorithmic judge.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that Taibbi grew up as \u201ca traditional ACLU liberal\u201d \u2013 these were his own words at the hearing. And even he his horrified by what he has discovered in the Twitter Files, which implicate both the government and the private sector \u2013 and the NGOs in between \u2013 for colluding to deprive Americans of their free speech rights online.\n\n\u201cIf Twitter declined to remove an account right away, government agencies and NGOs would call reporters for the New York Times, Washington Post, and other outlets, who in turn would call Twitter demanding to know why action had not been taken,\u201d Taibbi further revealed at the hearing.\n\n\u201cEffectively, news media became an arm of a state-sponsored thought-policing system.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about Big Pharma\u2019s murder-by-drugs crusade can be found at BadMedicine.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Twitter Files BOMBSHELL: Taxpayers unknowingly fund \u201cvast censorship enterprise\u201d hiding truth about vaccine injuries, deaths", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2023-03-14-taxpayers-fund-censorship-vaccine-injuries-deaths.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "Another major Twitter Files bombshell has dropped showing how a foreign dark money group called the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) oversees a \u201cvast censorship enterprise\u201d that, among other things, works behind the scenes to hide the deadly truth about vaccines from the public.
