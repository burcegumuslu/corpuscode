To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.\n\n\u201cNearly 20% of cancer[s]\u2026can be linked to infectious agents,\u201d such as viruses. There are seven viruses now conclusively tied to human cancer, and as new viruses enter into human populations, the incidence and causes of cancer will likely change accordingly.\n\nThe foundation of modern tumor virology was laid over a century ago, with the discovery of a cancer-causing chicken virus, for which a Nobel Prize was awarded. Another Nobel went to the guy that discovered the HPV virus was causing cervical cancer. And in his acceptance speech, he mused that there may be a bovine polyomavirus, a multiple tumor virus, in cattle, that could be playing a role in human colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. But, no polyomavirus had ever been discovered in meat\u2014until now.\n\nPolyomaviruses are a particular concern, not only because they are \u201cknown to be carcinogenic,\u201d but because they can survive cooking temperatures. Because single burgers these days can contain meat from \u201cmany dozens of animals,\u201d they figured it would \u201cpresent an ideal situation for virus-hunting.\u201d So, researchers at the National Cancer Institute just walked into three supermarkets, and grabbed meat right off the shelf, and found three different polyomaviruses in ground beef. Now, just because three types of polyomaviruses are \u201ccommonly detectable in food-grade ground beef\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are causing human disease.\n\nWhat made this Nobel laureate suspect them? Well, for one thing, some people got cancer right where they were vaccinated for smallpox\u2014a whole bunch of different cancers. The vaccine was harvested from \u201cthe\u2026skin of calves.\u201d And so, maybe there\u2019s some cancer-causing cow virus?\n\n\u201cMany people are exposed to potentially virus-contaminated meat and dairy products\u201d through their diet, but those in the industry would be even more exposed. So, it would be interesting to see if these groups have higher cancer incidence. And indeed, it now appears clear that those who work \u201cin the meat industry are at increased risk of developing and dying\u201d from a variety of cancers.\n\nAnother \u201creason\u2026to suspect the involvement of [some kind of] bovine infectious factor\u2026in colorectal cancer\u201d is the fact that countries that don\u2019t eat a lot of beef appear to have relatively low rates of colorectal cancer. And, countries that all of a sudden started eating lots of meat had their rates shoot up. Mongolia appears to be the exception. Lots of red meat, yet low colon cancer rates. But, \u201cthere they eat yak,\u201d and maybe yaks don\u2019t harbor the same viruses.\n\nCan\u2019t you just avoid steak tartare? Even steak cooked \u201cmedium\u201d may not reach internal temperatures above 70 Celsius, and it takes temperatures above that to inactivate some of these viruses. So, we would expect viruses to survive both cooking and pasteurization. In fact, they followed up with a paper suggesting that consumption of dairy products may represent a \u201cmain risk factor for the development of [human] breast cancer.\u201d The recent discovery of a larger number of presumably new viruses in the blood, meat, and milk of dairy cows should be investigated, since one might speculate that infectious \u201cagents present in dairy products [might have a special] affinity for [breast cells],\u201d since they came from breast cells.\n\nThe fact that people with lactose intolerance, who tend to avoid milk and dairy throughout their lives, have lower rates of breast cancer and other cancers could be seen as supporting this concept\u2014though there are certainly other reasons dairy may increase cancer risk, such as increasing levels of the cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1, or adversely affecting our gut microbiome. Or, for that matter, maybe the plant-based milks they\u2019re drinking instead could be protective. That\u2019s the problem with population studies: you can\u2019t tease out cause and effect. It doesn\u2019t matter how many viruses are found in retail beef, pork, and chicken if we can\u2019t connect the dots.\n\nCan\u2019t you just look for the presence of these viruses within human tumors? They\u2019ve tried, and found some. But, even if you don\u2019t find any, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean viruses didn\u2019t play a role. There\u2019s this \u201cviral hit-and-run\u201d theory of cancer development that suggests that certain viruses can slip in and out of our DNA to initiate the cancer, but be long gone by the time the tumor matures. So, there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\n\nBut, if the link between bovine polyomaviruses and human disease pans out, the National Cancer Institute researchers \u201cenvision the development of [a] high-potency\u2026vaccine\u2026\u201d So, just like the HPV vaccine may prevent cervical cancer from unsafe sex, one day, perhaps, vaccines may prevent breast and colon cancer from unsafe sirloin.\n\nPlease consider volunteering to help out on the site.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Flashback Friday: The Role of Burger Viruses in Cancer | NutritionFacts.org", "description": "Polyomaviruses discovered in meat can survive cooking and pasteurization.", "url": "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-the-role-of-burger-viruses-in-cancer/", "image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/themes/sage/dist/images/default-image.png", "type": "video.other", "video": "http://youtube.com/v/Gz3M-0Hdqa4", "video:height": "360", "video:width": "640", "video:type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "twitter:player": "http://youtube.com/v/Gz3M-0Hdqa4"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://nutritionfacts.org/volunteer"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "August 27, 2021"}
