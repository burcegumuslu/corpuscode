The number who wish to marry is even less. It would have been simple to satisfy their wish by creating a separate-but-equal marital status.\n\nInstead the government is affronting the vast majority of Canadians by treating their marriages as though they were homosexual. Why?\n\nMarriage is a heterosexual sacrament and the basis of both family and society. The Canadian action is prompted by feminist judicial decisions and is designed to undermine society's heterosexual foundation. It is part of an ongoing campaign against the family by the Rockefeller-based financial elite that governs the world.\n\nIn the 1960's the Rockefeller clique made feminism the official gender ideology. Feminists, like their Marxist forebears, think they can override nature. Applying Marxist dogma to biology, feminism teaches that men and women are equal and identical. \"Love of the same\" is of course homosexual.\n\nMales and females have an equal right to dignity and fulfillment but do not achieve these in the same way. Marriage is essential to self-fulfillment for most heterosexuals. It is based on the exchange of female power for male love. Men self-assert. Women self-efface. In this way, two become one and this unity is expressed by their child. See also \"It's Time to be Men Again.\"\n\nFeminism neuters both sexes by insisting on equal power. Women become masculine and men become feminine. The result is confusion, power struggle, disintegration and arrested development.\n\nHomosexuality can be defined as arrested development caused by inability to permanently bond with a member of the opposite sex. The government is trying to make homosexuals of us all. In this light, the Canadian decision makes perfect sense.\n\nThanks to feminism, the Canadian marriage rate (5 per 1000 people) is lower now than in 1931 during the Great Depression. It is down 44% since 1970. The divorce rate is up 35% from 1970.\n\nIn 1997 the Canadian birth rate, fell to its lowest point in history, 1.6 children per woman compared to 3.9 in 1960. It has since fallen to 1.48 (replacement is 2.2.) (Canadian Social Trends, Statistics Canada, Spring 2000)\n\nIn the US, more than half of all children are now born out-of-wedlock; and the number of single parent households has tripled. In \"The Broken Hearth\" (2001) William Bennett writes: \"Most of our social pathologies, crime, imprisonment rates, welfare, educational underachievement, alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, depression, STD's, are manifestations, direct and indirect, of the crack-up of the American family (4).\"\n\nHistorian Lawrence Stone writes, \"the scale of marital breakdown in the West since 1960 has no historical precedent and seems unique.\"\n\nFamily breakdown was not an accident. It was the result of a deliberate campaign of psychological warfare designed to destabilize and depopulate society. I suspect we could find parallels in the CIA's destabilization of Afro American society with drugs. This idea may seem outrageous until you understand the financial elite's goals and modus operandi.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1910, monopoly capitalists like J.P. Morgan and J.D. Rockefeller accumulated gigantic fortunes. Monopoly is the desire to \"have it all\" and that includes power. It was a small step for J.D. Rockefeller and his cronies to go from owning oil, pharmaceuticals, and banking etc. to wanting to possess and control the whole world. The financial elite sees humanity as largely superflous, \"useless eaters\" to be duped, distracted and manipulated.\n\nThis is the reason that Rockefeller and other monopoly capitalists have funded the depopulation and eugenics movements for a century. They want to reduce the world's population by about three billion and construct a new subservient breed of human being. Keep this in mind when you hear about new \"emerging diseases\" and read about the disappearance of prominent microbiologists. Feminism is another elite destabilization program. If you search \"Rockefeller Foundation\" and \"Women's Studies\" in Google, you will get over 19,000 entries.\n\nThe disagreeable truth is that Rockefeller and his ilk financed both Nazism and Communism. The purpose was to start wars, make money, destroy great nations and degrade humanity. According to historian Anton Chaitkin, the \"Rockefeller Foundation and its corporate, medical and political associates organized the racial mass murder program of Nazi Germany.\" It was behind the murder of 250,000 \"defective\" people, and Dr. Josef Mengele's sadistic experiments on live humans designed to artificially produce a new race.\n\nThe Rockefellers' Standard Oil was an intrinsic part of the Nazi war machine, supplying oil and other scare resources and technology. Through its \"I.G. Farben\" affiliate the Rockefellers used slave labor and financed the SS. The Rockefellers' conduct was typical of the American and British oligarchy.\n\nAfter the Second World War, OSS-CIA psychological warfare (propaganda) experts were put in charge of the major media outlets. Tax-exempt foundations sponsored and controlled research, universities and professional associations. Since then, the elite has secretly orchestrated \"spontaneous\" popular trends like the anti-war movement, the new age, and drug and counter culture movements. Second-wave feminism was also manufactured.\n\nLocal, state and national governments are controlled through a network of bodies like the \"Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations\" One commentator describes the operation of this body: \"All fifty legislatures appear to become simultaneously concerned about solving a particular problem in identical fashion. On the local level, the same thing happens in thousands of City Halls and County Seats. This strange coincidence of them all going in the same direction as if guided by one brain is never questioned by the press or by the public...\"\n\nIn the 1960's a campaign was unleashed to stigmatize women who devote their lives to family. In the bible of modern feminism, \"The Feminine Mystique\" (1963) Betty Friedan makes this obscene comparison between concentration camp inmates and motherhood.\n\n\"They were reduced to childlike preoccupation with food, elimination, the satisfaction of primitive bodily needs; they had no privacy, and no stimulation from the outside world. But above all, they were forced to spend their days in work which produced great fatigue...required no mental concentration, gave no hope of advancement or recognition, was sometimes senseless, and was controlled by the needs of others...\"(306)\n\nThis odious comparison of motherhood to the slavery of Auschwitz is classic psychological warfare. Friedan who concealed her Communist background should have been denounced as a hate monger.\n\nInstead, she was lauded as the new oracle and received honorary degrees and fellowships at Harvard, Yale and Columbia. Saturday Review called her book \"a scholarly work, appropriate for serious study\" and anthropologist Ashley Montegu said it was \"the wisest, sanest, soundest, most understanding and compassionate treatment of American woman's greatest problem.\"\n\nDo we need further proof that the world is a two-bit company town, and David Rockefeller and his clique are the company? They decide which politicians, universities and academics get funding, which books get published and hyped, which movies get made. We are condemned to looking at mirrors that reflect a fictitious reality. That's why people are so sceptical of conspiracy. TV oozes a comforting message that politicians actually serve our interests and everything is in order.\n\nThe mainstream media quarantines writers who reveal the truth while Eve Eisler reads her play \"The Vagina Monologues\" on HBO. This \"play\" which features women looking at their genitals with hand mirrors and describing steamy scenes of lesbian sex with minors, masquerades as feminist empowerment. In fact, it is solicitation to lesbianism.\n\nHuman reproduction requires the most delicate care. In the case of human beings, the female must be prepared for motherhood and honoured for her accomplishment. The male must be taught that it is a measure of manhood to provide leadership and sustenance for his family. Both parents must be prepared to give their children intellectual and spiritual guidance.\n\nInstead in schools and universities, the first tendrils of feminine sexuality are crushed under the feminist jackboot. Young women are taught that they have been oppressed for millennia, and all men are potential rapists. Homosexuality on the other hand is normal. How often have you seen mothers looking after their babies portrayed in a positive light on TV or in the movies?\n\nHeterosexuals get their identity, meaning and purpose from family roles. The plan to \"redefine\" marriage is intended to make the family obsolete and heterosexuals dysfunctional. In the Brave New World, people will be cloned. Our politicians, educators and journalists are shills for a satanic clique hell bent on destroying civilization and enslaving humanity.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://henrymakow.com/ads/hm.png", "image:width": "200", "image:height": "200", "site_name": "HenryMakow.com", "url": "https://henrymakow.com/000171.html", "title": "Canada Redefines Marriage", "description": " (This incorporates part of "}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["090303.html", "http://www.eugenics-watch.com/roots/chap12.html", "http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/deadbiologists.html", "http://www.sumeria.net/politics/eugenics.html", "http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Fascism/Trading_Enemy_excerpts.html", "180302.html", "http://www.webaccess.net/~comminc/Rockefeller.html", "150801.html", "241001.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
