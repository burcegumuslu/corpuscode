Greece says the US informed them the oil was Iranian, and that the US hired a different ship to take the oil to America. Iran has summoned the Greek charges d\u2019affaires and called the incident a \u201cclear example of piracy.\u201d The US accused the tanker of loading 700,000 Bbls of oil from Iran in August 2021. The tanker mostly sent oil to China.\n\nEarlier in the week, The Maritime Executive detailed that \u201cThe story of a shadowy Russian oil tanker took a new turn... as the U.S. Department of Justice seized the oil aboard the vessel and according to reports is in the process of transferring the oil to the United States on a chartered tanker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vessel was detained nearly seven weeks ago in Greece when authorities thought it was covered by the European Union sanctions on Russian assets.'\n\n\"But IT later held for mechanical deficiencies while watchdog groups announced that it was actually smuggling sanctioned Iranian oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Aframax tanker arrived off Greece early in April with reports of a possible mechanical failure and indications that they were looking for assistance to make repairs to continue their voyage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen she anchored south of the Greek island of Evia the 115,520 dwt tanker was being identified as the Russian-flagged Pegas.\u201d\n\nAnd the initial \u201cassumption at the time was that it was laden with a Russian crude oil cargo,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe seizure of the tanker, and oil, comes amid tensions in the ongoing nuclear talks.\n\nIran believes, and not unfairly, that the oil was just stolen from them, and the US position, while yet to be public, is that the oil is now theirs.\n\nIt\u2019s not a significant precedent, but generally, Iran can\u2019t do much about it, and the US is keen to have the oil.\n\n[READ MORE] EU to Impose Full Embargo on Russian Oil \u2013 Prices Set to Soar above $185", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/russia-tanker-pegas-lana-uani-iranian-oil-greece-sanctions-1_TYQy__v1024x512__box_0,69,960,573.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "US Seizes Russia-Flagged Tanker Carrying Iranian Oil Near Greece", "description": "The oil was being carried by a Russian-operated ship - The United States has seized an oil tanker near Greece, taking the Iranian oil within to be sent ... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Russia Ukraine", "Putin"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/us-seizes-russia-flagged-tanker-full-iranian-oil-near-greece", "https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/us-seizes-oil-from-shadowy-russian-tanker", "../../news/18878-eu-to-impose-full-embargo-on-russian-oil-prices-set-to-soar-above-185"], "authors": ["Daniel Newton"], "publish_date": "2022-05-27"}
