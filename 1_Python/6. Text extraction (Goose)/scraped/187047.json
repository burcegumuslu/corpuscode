They also disclosed that they have sent more than 800 emails to the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) about its vaccine mandate, all of which remain unanswered.\n\nAccording to the actors, their request for a religious exemption from vaccination has been ignored despite a return-to-work agreement established by SAG-AFTRA that explicitly says producers must consider them.\n\nIn one recent email to SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher, director Ed Rollin of \u201cSummer of \u201970\u201d fame wrote: \u201cNo business that I know of, including our own government, requires testing before you enter a building.\u201d Drescher, best known as the lead actress in the TV sitcom \u201cThe Nanny,\u201d was elected SAG-AFTRA president in 2021.\n\nActress and stuntwoman Michelle Jubilee Gonzalez, a member of the group pushing back against vaccine mandates, disclosed to the Epoch Times that she developed both reproductive and cardiac-related health problems immediately after getting a COVID injection. The vaccine was mandatory for her to continue working in different movie productions.\n\n\u201cSAG-AFTRA is no longer running like a member-run union, but rather a tyranny with [SAG-AFTRA Executive Director] Duncan Crabtree-Ireland at the helm,\u201d Gonzalez lamented. \u201cIt is criminal what is happening under his usurped leadership.\u201d\n\nThings came to a head when SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers decided to extend COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other protocols for members. (Related: Hollywood VAX BRAINWASH: No more movies made until every actor, director, and producer gets the clot shots in the name of \u201chumanity\u2019s better nature.\u201d)\n\nActors themselves speak out against vaccine mandate\n\nEven actor Woody Harrelson, who recently appeared in the 2022 film \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d mocked SAG-AFTRA\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate by means of an unscripted monologue. He performed the said monologue on the Feb. 25 edition of \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe movie goes like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest drug cartels in the world get together and buy up all the media and all the politicians, and force all the people in the world to stay locked in their homes. People can only can come out if they take the cartels\u2019 drugs and keep taking them over and over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI threw the script away. I mean, who\u2019s going to believe that crazy idea?\u201d\n\nAlso on Feb. 25, actress Maya Dunbar told the Epoch Times that refusing the COVID-19 vaccines has become like the \u201cscarlet letter\u201d in Hollywood. \u201cThousands of us [have] been gaslit, demeaned and kept out of meetings,\u201d lamented the actress who has previously appeared in shows such as \u201cHarry\u2019s Law\u201d and \u201cThe Mentalist.\u201d\n\nDunbar admitted that she initially understood the criticism lobbed against vaccine skeptics during the pandemic\u2019s early days. However, she eventually changed her mind after evidence of the shots causing more harm than good emerged \u2013 bringing into question the safety of the injections.\n\nThe actress also disclosed that the medical fascism she, her husband Rockmond Dunbar and their four children experienced was the most horrific experience their family has ever gone through.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of people who just don\u2019t want to lose what they have, [such as] their worldly treasures, if that means having to shill some shots, some pills or whatever [they are],\u201d Dunbar remarked. \u201cThis is a godless industry.\u201d\n\nShe ultimately pointed to Hollywood\u2019s reliance on Big Pharma advertising as the true reason why \u201ca blind pharmaceutical kind of frenzy cult\u201d has existed there.\n\nVisit MedicalFascism.news for more stories about the discrimination of unvaccinated people.\n\nWatch Sean Adl-Tabatabai of NewsPunch as he talks about celebrities calling for a \u201ctotal Hollywood strike\u201d until everyone is injected with the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nWashed-up Hollywood nobody Sean Penn says \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d for unvaccinated to be imprisoned.\n\nJimmy Kimmel says hospitals should turn away the unvaccinated and tell them \u2018rest in peace.\u2019\n\nFamous rapper and actor ICE CUBE says HELL NO to the deadly Covid jab and forgoes $9 million payday for upcoming role offer by Sony Film.\n\nHILARIOUS: Arrogant celebrities threaten \u201ctotal Hollywood strike\u201d until every last person in America gets \u201cvaccinated\u201d and \u201cboosted\u201d for covid.", "opengraph": {"title": "Actors pushing back against Hollywood\u2019s medical tyranny", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2023-02-28-actors-pushing-back-against-hollywood-medical-tyranny.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Entertainers in Hollywood have pushed back against medical tyranny coming in the form of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandates.
