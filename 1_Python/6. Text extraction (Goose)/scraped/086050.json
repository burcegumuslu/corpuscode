Delayed immunologic reactions have been described in association with the novel mRNA COVID\u201019 vaccines and boosters. We report the case of an 83\u2010year\u2010old female who presented with widespread pruritic urticarial indurated papules on the arms, legs, and palms, sparing the face six months following the booster vaccine. She denied constitutional symptoms, new medications, recent illnesses, or new personal care products. Punch biopsy demonstrated acanthosis, spongiosis, and superficial and mild dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltration with occasional eosinophils compatible with a dermal hypersensitivity reaction. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to\u00a0the need for systemic steroids as well as IV antibiotics secondary to a superimposed bacterial skin infection in the setting of severe itching and skin injury; she was discharged on oral steroids with follow-up to dermatology and rheumatology. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions typically peak within four days following vaccination and may be observed with COVID-19 vaccines or boosters. However, reports remain limited, and people\u2019s history of eczema should not preclude them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine that is both safe and effective.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/138676", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "A Rare Case of Delayed Hypersensitivity Following COVID-19 Booster Necessitating Treatment With Dupilumab", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
