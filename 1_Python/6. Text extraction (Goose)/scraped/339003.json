We are hearing some strong words about the current \u201cvaccination wars\u201d\u2014the push to make vaccinations mandatory in many states.\n\nOne critic called vaccinations \u201cbiochemical warfare against a largely unsuspecting public, particularly children, disguised as disease prevention by means of Mickey Mouse science.\u201d Said another observer: \u201cWe are struggling against one of the most dangerous, diabolical and powerful cults in the US; that is, \u2018science-based\u2019 and \u2018evidence-based medicine\u2019 within the Church of Scientism. Undoubtedly when future historians scour what remains of the news, computer files and texts from the early 21st century\u2019s Vaccine Age (assuming anything of humanity remains), they will identify a number of vaccine promoters as harbingers of vaccine barbarism. Certainly by then a new paradigm, which fully comprehends the advances in epigenetics and the functions of the epigenome, biological systems theories and biophysics will have informed our future ancestors that vaccination, as practiced during the primitive 20th and 21st centuries, was a medical abomination.\u201d\n\nMore strong words: \u201cFrom its inception vaccination has been fraught with no science, fraud, corruption, and big government money. Injecting cow belly pus and horse hoof pus into babies to keep them from getting sick? Roll forward to today\u2019s ingredients. How can this possibly be believed to be benign and \u2018for the good of the whole?\u2019 Sinister indeed.\u201d\n\nWe agree with the critics that vaccination as practiced today is a two-hundred-year mistake. We hope that the selection of articles on this page will justify these harsh words, and also give our readers the tools they need to protect themselves, from both the vaccinations themselves and from the infectious diseases against which these vaccinations are supposed to provide protection. And meanwhile, we will continue sending action alerts to various states where bills requiring mandatory vaccination are up for consideration in the legislatures. Childhood diseases are either mild or non-existent when parents practice the kind of good nutrition that we advocate. Diets rich in vitamins A and C can protect children against disease much better than vaccinations, and with side effects that are good, never harmful. Public health policy should be aimed at accurate information about nutrition, not the promotion of vaccinations that actually suppress the immune system and often have tragic side effects.\n\nGREATERGOODMOVIE.ORG: Home of the documentary \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d by WAPF honorary board member, Leslie Manookian.

You can do so by visiting https://vaers.hhs.gov . Select the \"Report an Adverse Event\u201d tab and and follow the instructions. VAERS is a passive system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, including parents and patients. Healthcare workers are required by law to report to VAERS, but often times they neglect to do so on the patient\u2019s behalf. It is wise to submit your own report. If you need further assistance with reporting, you can email info@VAERS.org or call 1-800-822-7967.\n\nVACCINE-INJURY.INFO: Lots of important information about vaccine injuries.Helps you find a doctor in your area who will respect your vaccination decisions.", "opengraph": {"locale": "de_DE", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccinations Archives", "description": "Vaccinations - The Most Important Decision Parents Will make", "url": "https://www.westonaprice.org/vaccinations/", "site_name": "The Weston A.
