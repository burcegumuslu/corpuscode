But North Korea has coordinated attacks on the six companies since August, the people said,\u201d the Journal noted, adding:\n\nThe [potentially hacked] firms include previously unreported targets in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson and Maryland-based Novavax Inc., which are both working on experimental vaccines, the people said. The list also includes three South Korean companies with Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] drugs in earlier clinical trials, Genexine Inc., Shin Poong Pharmaceutical Co. and Celltrion Inc., they added.\n\nNorth Korea had also tried infiltrating U.K.-based AstraZeneca PLC, whose vaccine co-developed with the University of Oxford, has been shown to be as much as 90% effective and is seeking emergency approval, the people said. On Friday, Reuters reported that suspected North Korean hackers had tried to break into the systems of AstraZeneca, citing unnamed sources.\n\nTwo days after the Journal\u2019s revelations, IBM reportedly cautioned that hackers from a potential \u201cnation-state\u201d targeted the coronavirus supply chain, without naming the suspect.\n\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, December 5th, 2020 at 6:40 pm and is filed under Conspiracy, Corruption, North Korea, Technology.
