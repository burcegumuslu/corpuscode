Oxitec, a subsidiary of Intrexon, applied for trial releases of its GM mosquito, which, according to the new information, would be inefficient and risky.\n\nOxitec previously denied that releasing millions of GE Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, with the aim of suppressing wild mosquito numbers, would result in increased numbers of the Aedes albopictus species (known as the Asian Tiger mosquito). The Aedes albopictus also transmits viral tropical diseases such as dengue and zika, and recently has been shown to be a vector of chikungunya, a devastating and sometimes lethal viral disease. The FDA recently approved trial releases of the GE mosquitoes in Florida.\n\n\u201cThese court documents show that Oxitec\u2019s GM mosquito trials are not worth the risk. The State of Florida and its mosquito control boards have in the past effectively controlled disease from multiple mosquito species using much more benign approaches such as vaccines, screens, repellents, larvicides and removing breeding sites like abandoned tires,\u201d said Jaydee Hanson, policy director of the International Center for Technology Assessment.\n\nThis new evidence from the Cayman Islands highlights that Oxitec is aware of a major flaw in its single-species, technological approach to eradicating disease-carrying mosquitoes. Oxitec makes clear that the release of the GE Asian Tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus might be needed if the release of the GE Aedes aegypti results in an increase of the numbers of Asian Tiger mosquitoes. Oxitec\u2019s 2014 application to the Cayman Islands Department of Environment states, \u201cShould Aedes albopictus begin to occupy the Aedes aegypti niche upon reduction in their numbers, a concurrent operation will begin to reduce the numbers of Aedes albopictus\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt might be a good business model for a company to sell a technology to reduce one mosquito species, so then they can also sell a technology to deal with the species that replaces it,\u201d said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. \u201cBut it\u2019s not worth the effort, expense and potential risk for communities in the U.S. to start down this path.\u201d\n\nAedes albopictus is a more invasive species than Aedes aegypti and can be found in all east coast U.S. states from Maine to Florida, all southern states, most Midwestern states and in the states along the US-Mexico border from Texas west to California.\n\n\u201cCurrent permits for releases should now be revoked until regulators recognise the downsides of Oxitec\u2019s technology and the need to consider all the impacts on the ecosystem. The consequences of mass releases of GM mosquitoes could be harmful if other disease-carrying mosquito species move in as a result. Risk assessments in Brazil, the Cayman Islands and the USA need to be revised,\u201d said Dr. Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch UK.\n\nThe company has also previously hid information about the mosquito\u2019s potential to survive. Company data noted that 15 to 18% of its GM mosquitoes survive when fed on cat food containing industrially farmed chicken, which contains the antibiotic tetracycline. Environmental groups have warned that this could lead to the survival and spread of large numbers of GM mosquitoes, when they encounter this common antibiotic in the environment e.g. in discarded takeaways or septic tanks.\n\n\u201cOxitec has misled the public about the risks. These GM mosquitoes may thrive in the wild or may lead to an increase in more aggressive mosquito populations,\u201d said Dana Perls, senior food and technology campaigner with Friends of the Earth, U.S. \u201cWe should be using the least toxic alternatives that don\u2019t have unintended consequences for our environment and health.\u201d\n\nFlorida Keys residents will have a non-binding vote on whether they support the release of Oxitec\u2019s genetically engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on November 8, 2016. A separate but related vote will occur in Key Haven, Florida, where Oxitec has received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to release its GM Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the first U.S. trial. Residents of Key Haven have strongly opposed the release of these mosquitoes.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Oxitec Admits GM Mosquitoes Could Result in Population Boom of Disease Carrying Asian Tiger Mosquito", "description": "Genetically modified (GM) mosquito company Oxitec has admitted a major risk of its technology \u2013 reducing one mosquito species may increase the numbers of", "url": "https://sustainablepulse.com/2016/09/30/oxitec-admits-gm-mosquitoes-could-result-in-population-boom-of-disease-carrying-asian-tiger-mosquito/", "site_name": "Sustainable Pulse", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/SustainablePulse/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/SustainablePulse/", "article:published_time": "2016-09-30T11:49:35+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2016-09-30T11:53:48+00:00", "image": "https://sustainablepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/asiantigermosquito.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "571"}, "tags": ["information", "Cayman Islands", "Food Water Watch", "risk", "technology", "GM", "Asian Tiger"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__link.email.dynect.net_link.php-3FDynEngagement-3Dtrue-26H-3DtiMleQXvuhG3cVWUKKJFwgesMDniOk1PHbBHFzJ47RvswGZJi6d6eYSLN5kaLx-252BBjvOHxN8GsSQ-252BVdEng5TJq-252BGCDCpt1yzRBE-252FJmL5tP2G2qEUQYsOcmA-253D-253D-26G-3D0-26R-3Dhttp-253A-252F-252Fwww.centerforfoodsafety.org-252Ffiles-252F2014-2Dapplication-2Dto-2Ddoe-2D3-5F97611.pdf-26I-3D20160929120008.0000018ca4a3-2540mail6-2D08-2Dewr-26X-3DMHwxMDQ2NzU4OjU3ZWMzODQ4NzNhZjRjNTY5MjU1YTMxYjs-253D-26S-3D7dEZvoNdHI4rA4y1zQmcf7cmyoUwp86GDdbl-2DYIlMBE&d=DQMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=zOqm1df3aheLkzYcO6_4F5kxFZGf07kYZywzSz_h8eg&m=Bvp6-zevi7XzOFEJUTkLl6RllwB4ib8756RCpi5fk_k&s=xChgxq-XvrDjroPN1lzwg2xWr18zeniSi0u5TlcJox0&e=", "https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__link.email.dynect.net_link.php-3FDynEngagement-3Dtrue-26H-3DtiMleQXvuhG3cVWUKKJFwgesMDniOk1PHbBHFzJ47RvswGZJi6d6eYSLN5kaLx-252BBjvOHxN8GsSQ-252BVdEng5TJq-252BGCDCpt1yzRBE-252FJmL5tP2G2qEUQYsOcmA-253D-253D-26G-3D0-26R-3Dhttp-253A-252F-252Fwww.cdc.gov-252Fzika-252Fvector-252Frange.html-26I-3D20160929120008.0000018ca4a3-2540mail6-2D08-2Dewr-26X-3DMHwxMDQ2NzU4OjU3ZWMzODQ4NzNhZjRjNTY5MjU1YTMxYjs-253D-26S-3Dx-5FUh-2DGUgVWHp3-5FM8r-5FZAiR3dd24-5FqInzfQRGV22mbUU&d=DQMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=zOqm1df3aheLkzYcO6_4F5kxFZGf07kYZywzSz_h8eg&m=Bvp6-zevi7XzOFEJUTkLl6RllwB4ib8756RCpi5fk_k&s=nou5aDf-mt1547jMeHkHFtfrgFc_X77qNorvUhspgOw&e=", "https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__link.email.dynect.net_link.php-3FDynEngagement-3Dtrue-26H-3DtiMleQXvuhG3cVWUKKJFwgesMDniOk1PHbBHFzJ47RvswGZJi6d6eYSLN5kaLx-252BBjvOHxN8GsSQ-252BVdEng5TJq-252BGCDCpt1yzRBE-252FJmL5tP2G2qEUQYsOcmA-253D-253D-26G-3D0-26R-3Dhttp-253A-252F-252Fwww.foe.org-252Fnews-252Farchives-252F2012-2D01-2Dgenetically-2Dmodified-2Dmosquitoes-2Dsurvival-2Drate-26I-3D20160929120008.0000018ca4a3-2540mail6-2D08-2Dewr-26X-3DMHwxMDQ2NzU4OjU3ZWMzODQ4NzNhZjRjNTY5MjU1YTMxYjs-253D-26S-3Di-5FZvnRgsNvLlQPWM27IyFMMog0-5F-5FVnvNlLmFSc6Fu0M&d=DQMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=zOqm1df3aheLkzYcO6_4F5kxFZGf07kYZywzSz_h8eg&m=Bvp6-zevi7XzOFEJUTkLl6RllwB4ib8756RCpi5fk_k&s=hPrnyfBEg9_Au_MCwb7LSwN_2mSjy0lto7OQ391iPhk&e="], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016-09-30T11:49:35+00:00"}
