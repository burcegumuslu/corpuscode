Instead, his office was flooded with calls from doctors, nurses, and other scientific medical experts who said they\u2019ve been threatened and blocked from sharing their stories.\n\nByram Bridle, associate professor of viral immunology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, is one of many medical professionals who said they\u2019ve faced extreme censorship for asking legitimate scientific questions about COVID.\n\nThe bridle was asked on a radio program if he believed COVID vaccines were linked to heart inflammation in young males. He gave his honest opinion, saying he did believe there is a link. He pointed to evidence to support it.\n\nWithin 24 hours, Bridle said he was attacked on all fronts. A \u201clibelous website\u201d and a fake Twitter account were created to slander him, said Bridle. He was harassed daily via phone, email, and social media, and one of his colleagues even went as far as to release confidential medical information about his parents, Bridle said.\n\nIt was an \u201cegregious act,\u201d said Bridle. \u201cA practicing physician should know they shouldn\u2019t be releasing confidential medical information.\u201d\n\nIn search of a place where he could speak freely, Bridle joined the Canadian COVID Care Alliance, a group of independent Canadian doctors, scientists, and healthcare practitioners committed to providing balanced evidence-based information to the Canadian public about COVID.\n\nBridle warned that suppressing open discussions of science and medicine in Canada violates the \u201challmark of a Democratic society.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the press conference was Dr. Patrick Phillips, a family and emergency medicine physician, and Dr. Don Welsh, professor of physiology and pharmacology at Western University.\n\nBoth expressed concerns about their inability to speak the truth about the negative effects of lockdowns and the benefits of using treatments such as vitamin D for COVID.\n\nPhillips said \u201cmassive lockdowns\u201d have caused a lot of harm and, until now, he\u2019s never seen so many suicidal children in his practice.\n\n\u201cScience has not been functioning properly for the last 15 months,\u201d Welsh said. The government\u2019s lockdowns, masks, infectious disease tracing, and social distancing have \u201ccreated a remarkable list of hardships for Canadians that will take this country many years to recover from.\u201d\n\nTags: anti-vaccine news censorship, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, COVID news, Covid vaccine, COVID vaccine censorship, COVID vaccine news, COVID vaccine risks,
