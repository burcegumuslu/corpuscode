Too many uninformed citizens are being kept in the dark about the true risks associated with these vaccines.\n\nThe most disturbing reality linked to vaccine injury payouts\n\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) was launched by President Reagan in 1986 as an \u2018alternative remedy\u2019 to judicial action for vaccine injuries. A key component is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) with its own \u201cvaccine court.\u201d\n\nWithin this system, consumers are required to meet an extremely high burden of proof to win their cases. Over its 30-year history, consumers have filed more than 20,000 petitions.\n\nThe result? Less than one-third of these victims receive compensation, and since only about one percent of vaccine injury cases are reported, only a fraction of those affected by vaccine side effects ever receive monetary compensation for their pain.\n\nWhile some victims do receive a legal victory, overall it seems like this program cares more about protecting the vaccine manufacturer. If big pharma is not held accountable for its actions, why should they focus on making vaccines safer?\n\nDespite horrific side effects: Vaccines get promoted, more than ever!\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC childhood vaccine schedule guarantees a large and lucrative market for the pharmaceutical companies. As you may know, there\u2019s been a push \u2013 in recent years \u2013 to vaccinate teenagers with the HPV shot.\n\nIn addition, the highly ineffective flu vaccine is heavily marketed to people of all ages.\n\nThe source of many vaccine side effects has been linked to the toxic metals \u2013 which are included as so-called \u2018necessary\u2019 ingredients. Many vaccines on the market today contain: aluminum, mercury and other ingredients that essentially function as neurotoxins \u2013 suppressing the immune system; leading to nervous system issues and cognitive problems.\n\nParents beware: children under the age of 3, in particular, receive these unsafe ingredients in amounts that far exceed acceptable levels.\n\nThe reason why vaccines cause problems like, autism and autoimmune disorders\n\nAccording to \u2018conventional wisdom,\u2019 adults should not receive more than 25 micrograms (mcg) of aluminum at one time; infants or children \u2013 no more than 10 micrograms. Yet, while adhering to a typical vaccine schedule, small children will be exposed to at least 250 mcg on their first day of life! (plus, much more before the age of 3)\n\nIn addition to neurological problems, autoimmune disorders and autism, many vaccine side effects include: chronic aches and pain, paralysis and even sudden premature death. Regulatory agencies and the drug companies themselves need to start focusing on better ways to protect our society from disease.\n\nInjecting neurotoxins into the human body is NOT \u2018safe\u2019 or \u2018effective.\u2019 It\u2019s just wrong.\n\nWe, as concerned citizens, must educate ourselves and (always) make informed decisions about our healthcare.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccine injury payouts exceed 4 billion dollars | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Vaccine injury payouts now exceed 4 billion dollars and health experts still insist that vaccinations are safe.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccine-injury-2788.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2018-12-01T06:11:50+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-09-09T17:07:54+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/green-drink-wlogo-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/4-billion-and-growing-u-s-payouts-for-vaccine-injuries-and-deaths-keep-climbing/", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/immunization-schedule-2217.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/hpv-vaccination-gardasil-2741.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/flu-vaccines-influenza-2759.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccines-aluminum-neurotoxicity-1536.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/4-billion-and-growing-u-s-payouts-for-vaccine-injuries-and-deaths-keep-climbing/", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccines-aluminum-neurotoxicity-1536.html", "https://www.naturahealth365.com", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccine-dangers-pregnant-women-1408.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/whopping-cough-outbreak-vaccine-dangers-1374.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/side-effects-of-gardasil-shot-vaccine-dangers-1349.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/adult-vaccination-schedule-1347.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/category/food_news", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=vaccines", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=vaccinations", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=vaccines+and+autism", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=mmr+vaccine", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=flu+shot", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=immunization", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=thimerosal", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=vaccination+danger", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/big-pharma-vaccine-dangers-safety-1371.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/vaccine-dangers-white-house-petition-1333.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/allergic-reactions-vaccinations-1422.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/influenza-vaccine-prevent-flu-1175.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=autism", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=autism+vaccines", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=autism+spectrum+disorder", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=autism+causes", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=autism+symptoms", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/?s=developmental+disabilities", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/cause-of-autism-1467.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/autism_news/1045_antibiotic_asthma.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/autism_news/1022_aluminum_toxicity.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/feed", "https://innercircle.naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.naturalhealth365store.com/grazing-goat-whey-protein"], "authors": ["Dena Schmidt, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2018-12-01T06:11:50+00:00"}
