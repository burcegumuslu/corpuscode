I think it would be interesting to compare with other writings from that time. After all what we read, write and say doesn\u2019t existe in a vacuum but references other works. It would be fascinating to compare this to other genealogies and see in what way they are similar and in what way they are different.\n\nI agree though an internal narrative perspective is also important. I am curious to see where the author goes with Genesis 5 and later on how he treats Matthew\u2019s genealogy.\n\nThis is copy and pasted from the Accommodation thread where I have been reviewing Spark\u2019s God\u2019s Word in human Words.\n\nUsher and the Mimetic Genealogy of Genesis 5\n\n Sparks points out the genealogy in Genesis 5, with its long life spans (365-969 years), is very much like a Sumerian kings list with even longer life spans (tens of thousands of years!). Bishop Usher used the Genesis genealogy incorrectly assuming it was straightforward history and mistakenly calculated the birth of the earth as 10/22/4004 BCE. At any rate, there are points of contact between the Genesis 5 and Sumerian King\u2019s list: \u00b7 Both provide a list of pre-flood heroes with very long life spans.\n\n \u00b7 The seventh person in each list did not die but went to heaven (Enoch and Enmedur-Anna). Given these points of contact and since Mesopotamian kings lists often stress the seventh king, many scholars feel that whoever wrote Genesis 5 simply took a Hebrew genealogy and patterned it after an older, Mesopotamian kings list. Supplementary evidence of this is found in the author of Genesis 5 possibly receiving most of this list from whoever authored Genesis 4. In addition, the final digit in the chronological information provided in the lists is 0, 2, 5 or 7 in all cases but one (26 out of 27 times!). These numbers are not strictly historical as this it not likely to arise by chance. Like some Sumerian kings lists they were probably influenced by \u201castronomical and mathematical figures.\u201d So Sparks argues the purpose of the list is not a factual genealogical listing. It mirrors Sumerian lists which \u201cwere important expressions of power and legitimacy in the Mesopotamian tradition.\u201d This was meant to show the \u201cvalue and significance of the Hebrew people.\u201d This makes even more sense if we suppose Jewish culture was being threatened (during or after the Babylonian exile). As opposed to bad or second rate history, Genesis 5 is good \u201cmimetic fiction\u201d and \u201cit is a truly masterful act of Israelite resistance to the arrogance of Mesopotamian culture.\n\nSo it will be interesting to see what Middleton suggests as while I don\u2019t see much reason to disagree with what Sparks wrote, this interpretation alone seems a bit generic and too simplistic to be the whole story.\n\n@HRankin what is the release schedule like for the other parts?
