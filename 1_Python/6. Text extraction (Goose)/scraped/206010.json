We will stop at nothing to stamp out these dangerous gangs.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said the plans would help ensure suspects \u201ccannot hide behind cultural sensitivities as a way to evade justice.\u201d\n\nThe police-led task force will be supported by the National Crime Agency and will comprise officers experienced in grooming gang investigations; the officers will work with data analysts to identify perpetrators who may have previously slipped through the net.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said on Sunday that a culture of political correctness and a fear of being accused of racism or bigotry had resulted in systemic abuse of predominantly White children by British-Pakistani grooming gangs. She insisted that \u201cthousands of children\u201d have had their \u201cchildhoods robbed and devastated\u201d by adult men who are \u201cstill running wild.\u201d\n\nWhen confronted by a report published by her own department in 2020, which disputed the government\u2019s claim that the vast majority of grooming gangs are made up of Asian males, Braverman cited several previous reports on the problem.\n\nThe first was the 2014 report detailing the findings of an independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in the northern English town of Rotherham, which concluded that \u201cby far the majority of the perpetrators were described as \u2018Asian\u2019 by victims, yet councilors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist, and others remembered clear directions from their managers not to do so,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe second was a 2015 report by Louise Carey, which stated how \u201canxiety around the ethnicity of perpetrators in Rotherham and other high profile cases may have further discouraged a focus on perpetrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been several reports since about the predominance of certain ethnic groups \u2014 and I say, British Pakistani males \u2014 who hold cultural values totally at odds with British values, who see women in a demeaned and illegitimate way and who pursue an outdated and frankly heinous approach in terms of the way they behave,\u201d Braverman told Sky News on Sunday\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stamp that out with criminal law and proper safeguarding, and we\u2019re only going to do that if as a society we face up to the facts and truth of what\u2019s going on,\u201d she added.", "opengraph": {"title": "Political correctness has hindered efforts to tackle Asian grooming gangs, claims British PM", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2023-04-04-political-correctness-hindered-efforts-tackle-asian-grooming-gangs.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "Victims and whistleblowers of grooming gangs, largely made up of British-Pakistani men, have often been ignored by authorities due to political correctness, claimed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as he announced fresh plans to tackle the long-standing issue.
