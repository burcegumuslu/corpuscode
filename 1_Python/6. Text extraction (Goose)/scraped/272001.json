While controversy around this issue continues to swirl, peer-reviewed research suggests the answer is a yes.In 2011, Neil Miller, Ph.D., and Gary Goldman, Ph.D., published a paper in the journal Human & Experimental Toxicology showing infant mortality rates correlated with childhood vaccination rates, with high-uptake countries having higher child mortality. As detailed in the abstract:Through the years, the Miller-Goldman paper has often been cited as evidence that the U.S. childhood vaccination schedule may be doing more harm than good. And, aside from an early debunking attempt by Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist, the paper has stood the test of time.Gorski argued that Goldman and Miller had conflicts of interest that swayed their analysis \u2014 Miller, because he operates a website that promotes informed consent, and Goldman because he founded a medical journal that published papers that were critical of vaccines.He discussed the CDC's suppression of undesirable vaccine data in a January 2022 interview.Then, all of a sudden, in December 2022, members of the Miller Lab at Brigham Young University in Utah, as part of the BYU Bioinformatics Capstone course, reanalyzedthe Miller-Goldman paper and tried to debunk it yet again.The critique, posted on the preprint server medRxiv (which is not peer-reviewed), claimed Miller and Goldman had employed \"inappropriate data exclusions\" to reach their conclusion, as they didn't analyze the full dataset, which included 185 nations.In response to the critique, Miller and Goldman conducted their own reanalysis, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cureus in early February 2023. The paper, \"Reaffirming a Positive Correlation Between Number of Vaccine Doses and Infant Mortality Rates: A Response to Critics,\"not only examines the critics' claims and methods, but also includes additional analyses to assess the reliability of their original findings. As explained in the abstract:In 2020, health authorities bemoaned the fact that COVID fears and lockdowns had the \"unfortunate\" side effect of lowering routine childhood vaccination rates. Vaccine safety advocates, on the other hand, predicted the decline might actually have a positive impact.Childhood vaccines have long been suspected of being a contributing factor to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).As noted by Australian researcher Viera Scheibner, Ph.D.:Interestingly, data from the first few months of the pandemic seemed to confirm this link. According to a white paperby Amy Becker and Mark Blaxill, published June 18, 2020,What's more, according to researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kaiser Permanente,Becker's and Blaxill's findings were addressed in a June 16, 2020, BMJ commentary. Responding to the authors of a paper titled \"Fewer American Infants Are Dying During the COVID-19 Lockdown. Why?\" retired pediatrician Allan S. Cunningham wrote:Some of strongest evidence linking SIDS and infant vaccines comes from Japan.Between 1970 and 1974, the Japanese compensation system paid out claims for 57 permanent vaccine injury cases related to the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine, and 37 deaths.The cluster triggered a boycott of the vaccine by doctors in one of the prefectures. As a result of that boycott, the Japanese government raised the minimum age for DTP vaccination from 3 months to 2 years.In contrast, the U.S. has the highest infant mortality rate \u2014 and the highest vaccination rate as well. If infant vaccinations improve health and save lives, why do statistics not support such claims? As noted in Miller's and Goldman's 2011 paper:In the August 2022 Substack article \"The Century of Evidence That Vaccines Cause Infant Deaths,\" a doctor who goes by the moniker A Midwestern Doctor reviewed the link between vaccination and SIDS:Other compelling evidence linking vaccines and infant mortality comes from the decades-long work of Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, a clinical professor at University of Southern Denmark and her colleague Dr. Peter Aaby, a vaccine scientist and promoter of vaccination commissioned by the WHO to study the effects of vaccines used in charitable programs.A review of their four decades of investigation was published in Clinical Microbiology and Infections in August 2019,and reported by Science News DK in December that year.Benn and Aaby also published a studyin 2017, which showed the DTP program in Africa was a disaster, as vaccination was associated with a fivefold higher mortality, on average, than being unvaccinated \u2014 3.93 times higher for boys and 9.98 times higher for girls.Overall, inactivated (non-live) vaccines increased mortality, especially among girls, even when they offered a high degree of protection against the target disease. This was true for the DTP, pentavalent vaccine, inactivated polio vaccine, H1N1 influenza vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine.GlaxoSmithKline's antimalarial vaccine (RTS, S/AS01 or RTS,S, sold under the brand name Mosquirix), which appears to offer between 18% and 36.3% protection against malaria depending on the age group,As Stabell Benn told Science News DK:Live attenuated vaccines, on the other hand \u2014 such as the older measles vaccine, the bacillus Calmette-Guerin against tuberculosis, oral polio vaccine and the smallpox vaccine \u2014 seemed to offer nonspecific protection against deadly diseases, contributing to a lowering of overall mortality.That simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines might be particularly risky seems obvious, yet it's routinely done. A Midwestern Doctor writes:An analysisof data in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) by Miller, published in 2021, also found that \"Of 2,605 infant deaths reported to VAERS from 1990 through 2019, 58 % clustered within three days post-vaccination andAs noted by Steve Kirsch, until or unless we have full data transparency, the question of whether the harm done by vaccines outweighs the benefits cannot be settled:", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/478336-Study-More-infant-vaccines-lead-to-higher-infant-mortality", "type": "website", "title": "Study: More infant vaccines lead to higher infant mortality -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/660900/full/vaccines_cant_be_given_to_youn.jpg", "description": "Do childhood vaccines impact a child's mortality risk?
