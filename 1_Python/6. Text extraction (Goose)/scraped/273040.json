Massimo Pigliucci on How to Tell Science From Bunk\n\nCity University of New York Professor skeptical of near-death experience, likens NDE researchers to astrologers.\n\nThere\u2019s pseudoscience, bunk, scientific nonsense, and then there\u2019s real science\u2026 at least according to Dr. Massimo Pigliucci author of, Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science From Bunk.\n\nJoin Skeptiko host Alex Tsakiris for an interview with Professor Massimo Pigliucci, a philosopher at the City University of New York. During the hour-long interview Dr. Pigliucci rejects claims of near-death experience science. When asked to explain why so many NDE researchers have concluded otherwise Dr. Pigliucci stated, \u201d that\u2019s like saying the vast majority of astrologers are in agreement with the fact that astrology works.\u201d\n\nPigliucci also offers his opinion on how non-scientists should choose sides on controversial science issues like climate change, \u201cI am about to go to the Amazing Meeting in Las Vegas, which is organized by the James Randi Foundation, and I fully expect to upset several people there because my presentation will be about how skeptics are not scientists and therefore, they shouldn\u2019t really pass judgment on issues for which the scientific community has reached a consensus. For instance, let me give you an example. Several skeptics, including James Randi, are skeptical of the notion of climate change and global warming. Well, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not their place. They\u2019re not climate scientists; they know nothing about climate science. And frankly, they don\u2019t have the expertise to pass judgment.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Today we welcome someone who\u2014let me get this straight\u2014has three PhDs, is that right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [Laughs] So Dr. Massimo Pigliucci is a Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York. He\u2019s a well-known thinker and writer in the skeptical community, and he\u2019s also the author of several books, including his latest that we\u2019re going to talk about today entitled, Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science From Bunk. Dr. Pigliucci, welcome to Skeptiko.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: It\u2019s a pleasure to be here.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, thanks so much for joining me. You know, I got my hands on your book, and it was really interesting. I experienced the full range of reactions reading it. At times I found myself in total agreement with you. Certainly what this show\u2019s been all about is finding the data and trying to find the scientific data and follow it wherever it leads, even if it\u2019s unconventional in its direction. But I also found myself, I guess, sometimes at odds with both your interpretation of the science methods and what science is revealing.\n\nSo while I was reading your book, Nonsense on Stilts, I kept coming back to a quote, a comment from a recent guest of ours, Dr. Peter Bancel who\u2019s an experimental physicist in France and is a collaborator on the Global Consciousness Project. So what I\u2019d like to do to kick things off, if this is okay, is I\u2019d like to play you this clip from Dr. Bancel, which I think will really frame up this discussion, and then get your reaction, if that\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cThe Skeptiko approach is interesting, but it\u2019s\u2014to my mind it\u2019s not science. Skeptics are basically concerned that somebody is wrong in their thinking and that thinking should be corrected. And so skeptics are worried about sort of convincing people that they\u2019re wrong, or something like that. So it has to do with a sort of a social question. I mean, science is something else. Science is\u2014to my mind it doesn\u2019t really even take a skeptical stance. It\u2019s just trying to ask the best questions that you can and then devise the best experiments to address those questions, simply because you\u2019re curious about how things are going on in the world.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay. So any thoughts on that?\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Yes, I think he\u2019s right on the first point. He\u2019s not right on the second point. So he says that skepticism is not science. That\u2019s correct. In fact, I am about to go in a month or so to the Amazing Meeting in Las Vegas, which is organized by the James Randi Foundation, and I fully expect to upset several people there because my presentation will be about how skeptics are not scientists and therefore, they shouldn\u2019t really pass judgment on issues for which the scientific community has reached a consensus.\n\nFor instance, let me give you an example. Several skeptics, including surprisingly James Randi himself, as well as most famously Penn and Teller, are skeptical of the notion of climate change and global warming. Well, I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s not their place. They\u2019re not climate scientists; they know nothing about climate science. And frankly, they don\u2019t have the expertise to pass judgment.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that science is always right or the experts are always right by far. In fact, in my book I base an entire chapter about the long history of blunders in science. So I\u2019m certainly not suggesting that science is infallible or anything like that.\n\nBut I am saying that unless you actually have that technical expertise in matters of science, your job should not be to sort of be skeptical of notions such as climate change or the fact that AIDS is caused by HIV or the fact that there\u2019s no connection between autism and vaccines, and so on and so forth. So I do agree with your previous guest that skepticism is not science.\n\nSkepticism is a movement that deals with public understanding of science. I mean, the point of skeptics is to increase further public understanding of science by explaining to the general public the difference between science and bunk. It is not to criticize science itself because science itself already has a very well established set of procedures for how to criticize its own ideas. It\u2019s called the peer review process. So on that one I agree.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But hold on\u2014I\u2019m sorry, go ahead and address the second point.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Yeah, let me make quickly the second point and then we can have a discussion about it. So the second point that your guest made was that science doesn\u2019t even take a skeptical stance. That I don\u2019t think is correct. In fact, the history of science shows that more often than not, the scientists tend to be conservative in their acceptance of new theories and new notions. That is, the typical response of a scientist to a new theory is, \u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t believe it,\u2019 or \u2018Show me the data,\u2019 or \u2018Let me see why you think that that is the case,\u2019 which of course is a quintessential skeptical stance. And frankly, I think that\u2019s for good reasons.\n\nYou know, science is a well-established set of procedures and it has produced a well-established body of knowledge, so any new theory, any new notion, especially if it is contrary to what science has accepted up to that point, ought to be received and is, in fact received by scientists with skepticism. That doesn\u2019t mean that scientists don\u2019t change their mind. It doesn\u2019t mean the new theories are not eventually accepted if in fact they are good theories; they are sound theories.\n\nBut the initial reaction is always one of\u2014when you write a scientific paper, which I\u2019ve done several times in my career as a scientist before becoming a philosopher\u2013when you write a scientific paper, the first thing that the editor does, or the journal where you submit the paper does, is to send it to two, three, or four people to criticize it. The first reaction is one of skepticism. People want to make sure that what you write is sound, that it makes sense that your conclusions are congruent with the data that you have and so on and so forth.\n\nSo I disagree that the stance of science is not one of skepticism. Of course it is. But it is of skepticism in the positive sense; it\u2019s not skepticism in the sense of \u2018I don\u2019t believe it not matter what,\u2019 it\u2019s skepticism in the sense of \u2018Okay, let\u2019s see what you claim is and if the evidence that you put forth is proportional to the claim.\u2019\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Right. And without degrading into a total discussion about semantics, what I\u2019ve found totally delightful about Dr. Bancel\u2019s comment is I think it reframes what you\u2019re saying in a more positive light in that yes, science is a method, it\u2019s not a position. I think he puts that out first and foremost and says, let\u2019s always remember it\u2019s about the method and therefore, being skeptical, this agitation kind of stance that we think of isn\u2019t necessary, I think is what he\u2019s saying. What he\u2019s saying is just ask good scientific questions; ask them in a way that is testable inside of an experimental framework, and voila, you have good science.\n\nI agree with that and I\u2019d take it one step further and maybe ask you, don\u2019t you see that perhaps there\u2019s a fundamental problem when we start throwing around terms like \u2018bunk\u2019 and \u2018pseudo-science?\u2019 Let me refine that a little bit, if I will, and give you an example. A few years ago when the Korean stem cell research or Hwang Wu Suk\u2014I had to look up his name\u2014he came out and he had fabricated his data, right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: So he created all this data to get the results he wanted and he posted it. Now that\u2019s bunk. Or an example I\u2019ve used on this show before is Sigmund Freud, a pillar in our scientific community, but when you look at what he did it was bunk. He created these cases that didn\u2019t really exist and then published them like real data. Now that\u2019s bunk.\n\nBut when we venture into some of these other areas where there are different opinions, where people are struggling to kind of figure out the science, don\u2019t we have to be careful when we throw around terms like \u2018pseudo-science\u2019 and \u2018bunk?\u2019 I mean, I run into that all the time with parapsychology and other controversial science, where people are throwing out these terms and they just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re not grounded in the research. They\u2019re just grounded in a position. Here\u2019s my position, is that mind equals brain, so anything that contradicts that, I don\u2019t even have to really look at the science behind it. I know it\u2019s false; it\u2019s bunk. It\u2019s pseudo-science.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Right. So you make some interesting points but let me make a few comments. First of all, the case of the Korean research on stem cells, it\u2019s actually not even bunk, it\u2019s just fraud, right? I mean, had the results been real, meaning they would have been, in fact, science not bunk. They would have been perfectly good science.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But he did have some good science, right? I mean, he\u2019s a good researcher. He just stretched so\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: No, he just made up stuff so that\u2019s fraud, and there are very good procedures within the scientific community to punish people, scientists who engage in fraudulent production of data. The papers are publicly retracted by the journals, there is an international system of censure, and so on and so forth. So I wouldn\u2019t call that example bunk because had it been genuine data, that would have been perfectly fine science that would have been simply making up a perfectly normal contribution to the way we understand that the biology of stem cells. What happened instead is that those researchers just made up stuff, in which case\u2014that happens from time to time\u2014so I would consider that fraud.\n\nNow let\u2019s go to Freud. Freud is not exactly pseudo-science, either. This was a classic case that was treated by Karl Popper, who was the philosopher of science who originally came up with the idea of what I call the in the book the demarcation problem. The demarcation problem is how do you tell science from non-science?\n\nWhat Popper did was to take some examples of what he considered absolutely solid science, and the best one that he could come up with was Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, which had been spectacularly confirmed very recently when Popper was writing, and to compare that to examples of clear non-science. One of these examples was, in fact, Freudian psychoanalysis. But what he said about Freud was that it\u2019s not a question of whether Freud was right or wrong; it\u2019s a question of how do we know whether he was right or wrong?\n\nPopper\u2019s point is that we can\u2019t know because pretty much every human behavior is explainable one way or another by psychoanalytic theory. Popper\u2019s point is if a theory is that flexible, that no matter what the data are it can explain them, then there is no way in principle, even, to falsify the theory, to show that the theory\u2019s wrong, if it is in fact wrong. And a theory that cannot be falsified is not science. If there is no way to tell whether a theory is right or wrong because the theory explains everything that gets thrown its way, then it\u2019s not science. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s pseudo-science; that doesn\u2019t even mean it\u2019s wrong. It just means that we cannot know and therefore we cannot think of it as science.\n\nNow let me get to your third example, which is paranormal\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hold on. Let me just interject there because I agree with you. I think that\u2019s a great point and I love the way you pulled it out. In Freud\u2019s case, as we found out later, probably later after Popper wrote that is that there was actually fraud involved. I mean, he didn\u2019t really have those patients. He was manufacturing\u2014the theory was that his theory, whether that was real science or not\u2014but the data that he used to support it wasn\u2019t real data. So you kind of have both\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: I am not sure about that point. I don\u2019t know enough about the history of psychoanalysis to actually confirm that.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Well, if it is then it\u2019s a matter of fraud and it falls into the same in the first example before. But there is no reason why the theory itself has to be discarded just because a particular practitioner engaged in fraud. I mean, that\u2019s the same for as far as research on stem cells. It\u2019s not like we shouldn\u2019t do stem cell research or that there\u2019s something wrong with the biology of that research just because that particular Korean group of researchers engaged in fraud.\n\nSo there\u2019s a distinction we need to be making between individual instances of researchers who commit fraud\u2014those obviously should be discarded as such. If you make up stuff then it\u2019s obviously not science. But a distinction needs to be made between that and the possible failure of the theory itself. And my point was therefore broader about Freudian psychoanalysis. The idea is that it\u2019s not a scientific theory, period. No matter even if the data are correct. Even when the data are right; even when you can bring up case histories, document the case histories and all that. The theory still is not science because it cannot be falsified.\n\nNow let\u2019s go to your third example, which is paranormal research. You\u2019re right, a lot of people do throw around terms like \u2018bunk\u2019 a little too easily. In fact, if you check out in the book, there is a chapter where I talk about paranormal research and UFOlogy, for instance\u2014UFOs and things like that. I actually do criticize some alleged skeptics or what I call \u201carmchair skeptics\u201d who come up with explanations.\n\nThe case that I get into in some detail is a particular instance of alleged flying saucers being observed. A couple of skeptics just reacted when they were asked by the media, coming up with explanations basically out of thin air for what the flying saucer was. It turned out that those explanations were in fact wrong. There was a natural explanation for the sighting but it wasn\u2019t the one that the skeptics were providing.\n\nSo that\u2019s an example of a skeptic being close-minded. They simply knew that it couldn\u2019t possibly have been flying saucers and so they came up with the first explanation that came to their mind without bothering to check whether the explanation actually fit the data. That\u2019s not good skepticism. Now that is not the kind of thing that we need to do.\n\nOn the other hand, research on the paranormal has been done for almost a century. We have done plenty of experiments, say on telepathy or clairvoyance or things like that, and we know it doesn\u2019t work. So how many more times do we have to show that?\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Of course it is.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No. I\u2019ll tell you what. That\u2019s going to launch us into, I think, the other part of this discussion, which I think is interesting. Talking about philosophy of science and skepticism is interesting and it provides some grounding and I like a lot of the points that you scoped out there and I think that\u2019s useful in the book, but it does seem\u2014and I expressed this in the email to you\u2014it\u2019s only when you really dig into it that you really have a grip on this.\n\nI think for me, you get to the real challenges of this skepticism and bunking and pseudo-science. What I\u2019d pull us back to, and I sent you this in email, is a post that you wrote in October 17, 2006 about out-of-body experiences. So this is something that we\u2019ve dug into more on this show, so I can at least know a little bit of something about, unlike some of the other topics you talk about where I\u2019ll just be out in the weeds.\n\nIn this post, here is the comment that you make that I just find incredibly troubling. You talk about the nature article and Olaf Blanke\u2019s research and then you say, \u201cThis is good stuff. That should take care of the whole paranormal mumbo-jumbo about out-of-body experiences.\u201d Now that\u2019s your quote.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Uh-huh (yes). I stand by that quote, yes.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: It\u2019s astounding. To me, it seems incredibly\u2014well, it seems unscientific. I mean, here you have this phenomena, out-of-body experience. It\u2019s widely reported; it\u2019s very perplexing; it\u2019s very much unexplained, especially since a large number\u2014the largest number of the cases reported happens at times when we can presume that there\u2019s no electrical activity in the brain. That is, people are flat-lined, and that\u2019s when they\u2019re having OBEs. So that\u2019s the situation.\n\nAnd then you have this research come along and it produces the effect that\u2019s similar, but everyone agrees, hey, this isn\u2019t really a full-blown out-of-body experience. It\u2019s not a lucid experience; it\u2019s hallucinatory; it\u2019s not a full body experience. All these things that we normally see in an out-of-body experience\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: But out-of-body experiences are hallucinatory. That\u2019s the point.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, no. They\u2019re really not if you research them as they\u2019re most encountered in the near-death experience research\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026and what the near-death experience research finds conclusively over and over in studies is that they\u2019re non-hallucinatory.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: You mean to say that there is actually research that shows that people get out of their bodies?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: All this research is descriptive, right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: So Olaf Blanke just asks people about their experience and if you look at that research when they\u2019re reporting on their out-of-body experience, they say, \u201cMy arms were shorter than they were. They were out of proportion. They were in this way, that way.\u201d Those are clearly hallucinatory. That\u2019s not how their body really is. It\u2019s exactly the opposite in near-death experience. They don\u2019t see things hallucinatory. They\u2019re realistic.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: They may be realistic but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re real. I mean, we have plenty of\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But hold on, hold on.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But here\u2019s the point. The point is that you have this one study. He didn\u2019t even really look at near-death experience. He just speculated that this might have some similarity. I would add that the study was not replicable, right? There\u2019s a researcher in Sweden who tried to replicate the experiment. To this day, no one has really replicated Blanke\u2019s work. But you jump on it and say, \u201cThis should take care of the whole paranormal mumbo-jumbo.\u201d I mean, we have some real science here to unravel. It seems like it\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Actually, we don\u2019t. There\u2019s been a lot of research done on so-called out-of-body experiences. And we know that\u2019s\u2014the article that I cite there, it\u2019s only one piece of evidence that the paranormal so-called explanation is in fact not an explanation at all.\n\nThere is plenty of research that has been done on out-of-body experiences. We know that they can be caused by certain physical chemical conditions in the brain. We know that they are essentially\u2014the best explanation\u2014I shouldn\u2019t say we know, but the best explanation for what\u2019s going on is that these are, in fact, hallucinatory experiences that are caused by certain replicable, by the way, chemical physical characteristic\u2013situations of the brain.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay, what research are you citing? What research is that?\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Well, I can give you the list on when we get off the air but that the problem is\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I just got done with that same kind of conversation with Dr. Steven Novella and\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Right. Yeah, he\u2019s a good source on that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, I just got done interviewing him and he came to the same point that there\u2019s a bunch out there and he never followed through. So I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re talking about Persinger. Michael Persinger\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Persinger is certainly one of those, absolutely. But the\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay, I don\u2019t\u2014we\u2019ve had him on the show. I don\u2019t think his research at all is conclusive in that way. He hasn\u2019t worked with near-death experience researchers and when he has, it hasn\u2019t been an experience that they say matches up to their experiences. So my point\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Yes, but my point is you\u2019re making\u2014you or whoever is making points\u2014a paranormal explanation for near-death experiences is an extraordinary claim. We do have alternative explanations which are much more naturalistic and much more rational for those experiences. It seems to me that of course, again, science is not\u2014it\u2019s not about ultimate truth. It\u2019s about provisional conclusions.\n\nBut from everything that I\u2019ve read of that literature, it seems to me that the naturalistic explanation is by far the most likely. Now if you want to make the case that no, it\u2019s not, and there is something else, it seems that that is an extraordinary claim and as Carl Sagan famously put it, \u201cWell, that requires extraordinary evidence.\u201d Besides, what kind of explanation is there really? It\u2019s your paranormal explanations don\u2019t seem to me explanations at all. There\u2019s no mechanism that is being proposed; there is no understanding of how these kinds of things happen. That\u2019s not science.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Wow, that\u2019s really going to launch us off in a couple of different areas.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: First of all, okay, the other researchers. And that\u2019s all we can do is balance all the research out there. The folks that we\u2019ve had on this show, and one of the people I point to is Dr. Peter Fenwick, one of the most highly regarded neuropsychologists in the world, practicing in the UK for many, many years. He was on and spoke quite, I think authoritatively, about the out-of-body experience research, about Blanke\u2019s research, about Persinger\u2019s research, and he finds it interesting but not at all compelling in the way that you do.\n\nThe same with the other folks that I\u2019ve had on. Dr. Jeffrey Long has written extensively and published peer-reviewed articles about the very marked differences between Blanke\u2019s out-of-body experience that he encounters and those that he\u2019s encountered in near-death experience. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all to the point where we can say this whole \u201cparanormal mumbo-jumbo\u201d stuff should go away. And I think that\u2019s part of the problem. When you get into the\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Alex, I\u2019m sorry. Let me stop you there for a second. If we\u2019re going to play the expert game, it\u2019s too easy. That\u2019s one of the things that I get into in the book. Almost for any position whatsoever, no matter how far out it is, you will find somebody with a PhD. or an MD that is willing to defend that position. But that\u2019s not the way science works. I mean, you can find scientists who deny climate change. You can find scientists who deny evolution. You can find scientists\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But Massimo, in this case, it\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026because\u2014hold on. Let me finish my point before you disagree. The large majority of near-death experience researchers who\u2019ve really published in this field are in consensus. They\u2019re in agreement.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Alex, that\u2019s like saying the vast majority of astrologers are in agreement with the fact that astrology works.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s an outrageous statement. How can you claim\u2014it is. How can you claim\u2014have you even read\u2014do you know these people\u2019s qualifications? Do you know their published work? You\u2019re lumping them all together and calling them astrologers? I mean, where do you come off saying that? Again, Blanke, the guy that you\u2019re referencing, he\u2019s not a bad guy but he\u2019s never studied near-death experience. And even since his publication, he\u2019s even come out and said, \u201cI think the phenomena are still real and not totally explained by just the mechanics of it\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Alex, there\u2019s a distinction between saying that a phenomenon is real. I don\u2019t doubt the phenomenon is real. No neuroscientist doubts the phenomenon is real. That\u2019s one thing on which we agree. I would also agree that we don\u2019t have complete understanding of the phenomenon itself.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t bother me either, because we don\u2019t have complete understanding of many more mundane things that the brain does, let alone how the brain reacts under unusual conditions. There is a huge gulf however, between that and saying that these people are actually having some kind of super-normal, paranormal, or supernatural experience. That\u2019s a huge\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But I didn\u2019t even get there\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: I know you didn\u2019t but this\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026you didn\u2019t even let me get there because\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026because you threw all these people\u2014you threw all these researchers into the category of astrologers. I mean, when you talk about\u2014I mean this whole point is how do we separate science from bunk? And I\u2019m talking to\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Let me be more clear about what I said or what I meant to say. If somebody who does near-death experience research claims that what these people are doing is experience\u2014having a supernatural experience, that\u2019s not science. It\u2019s not science because first of all, science cannot actually say anything about the supernatural to begin with. That\u2019s not what science does.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Yes, by definition. By epistemological, if you want to be technical. It\u2019s by epistemological agreement in philosophy of science. No philosopher of science would agree that science has anything to say about the supernatural for a variety of reasons that we can get into if you want.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That gets into semantics.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: No, it\u2019s not semantics. Epistemology is not semantics. Epistemology is\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Right. But the discussion\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: \u2026a serious branch\u2014let me finish for a second. It\u2019s a serious branch of philosophy that deals with how do we know things, right? And since science has been well understood over the last several decades in philosophy as a particular kind of activity which is based on a particular set of assumptions about what is being studied, one of those assumptions is regularity of the laws of nature. If the laws of nature started behaving erratically or in a way that is completely unpredictable you wouldn\u2019t be able to do science.\n\nNow the supernatural, by definition doesn\u2019t have to be bound by natural laws, obviously, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be supernatural, which means that in fact epistemologically science has reached its limit there. There is nothing sensible that a scientist can say about the supernatural. And therefore, if a scientist claims\u2014invokes a supernatural explanation for a particular phenomenon, that scientist right there has ceased to do science.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But who are we talking about here? I\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: I don\u2019t know. Who are we talking about? We\u2019re talking about people who suggest that there are supernatural or paranormal implications into these kinds of experiences\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But I didn\u2019t bring that up. You\u2019re arguing kind of against yourself. I brought up\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Well, I like to do that because I always win that way.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [Laughs] Fair enough. But I brought up Dr. Peter Fenwick. I brought up Dr. Jeffrey Long. If you\u2019re familiar\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Let\u2019s not talk about individuals. Let\u2019s talk about explanations. What is it that these people think is going on?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, let me finish my darned sentence here.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: The theory is that consciousness, in some way we don\u2019t totally understand, survives bodily death. Now, that\u2019s well-constructed. It\u2019s not totally framed up in scientific terms but it\u2019s an important theory because it contradicts the prevailing materialistic explanation of consciousness, which is pretty much nonexistent because consciousness is something we\u2019re grabbing at. So to say that consciousness in some way we don\u2019t understand seems to survive bodily death, I don\u2019t know why that violates some sacred creed of science. I don\u2019t think it does.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: It\u2019s not about anything sacred because science doesn\u2019t have any sacred creeds. It has assumptions, as I said, but those are not sacred. Even those are not sacred. So let\u2019s analyze what you just said. You said something like this is a theory of consciousness or a theory of survival of consciousness beyond the physical brain that we don\u2019t completely understand. You said something on those lines.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hold it. I\u2019d interject. We do not understand consciousness. I mean no one understands consciousness.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: No, no, no, I\u2019m not referring to consciousness. I\u2019m referring to you saying that these people are putting forth a theory something on the lines of an incomplete or not yet completely formed theory of survival of consciousness beyond the physical brain. Is that correct?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, we have to step back and say we\u2019re trying to get our arms around consciousness, whether it\u2019s material or immaterial, what it is, when it begins, does it begin at birth\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: But we do have quite a bit of knowledge about consciousness. I would certainly agree that the problem of consciousness is far from being solved, but it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know anything about it, right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Right. We can always say we know something about it, but fundamentally, we don\u2019t understand its nature, whether it\u2019s material or immaterial, whether there\u2019s a cause and effect, all those things are up for grabs.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Well, actually we do. In philosophy\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let me finish. We don\u2019t know what entities or beings are conscious. We don\u2019t know\u2014we think dogs and gorillas are conscious because when they look at themselves in the mirror they identify themselves. We think other animals have some other limited form of consciousness.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let me finish. We don\u2019t know if computers can be conscious or what\u2019s necessary\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: We know that they are not.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [Laughs] Okay, we know that they\u2019re not. So the point being that when anyone who speculates about the end of consciousness is only speculating, even if we get down to hard-nosed medical terms, we\u2019re really less and less sure about what death actually means. I just heard Dr. Sam Parnia, who\u2019s explored this probably more than anyone in terms of resuscitation and what our definition of death really means.\n\nSo to then in that larger context for someone to explore one aspect of that and saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to explore the end of consciousness and whether consciousness can survive bodily death,\u201d and then present the findings of the phenomena that they observed, is that in some way from the research that we\u2019ve done, consciousness seems to survive bodily death. That\u2019s how I\u2019d frame it up.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: All right. First of all, it doesn\u2019t because even if I grant you that there is something about what you\u2019re saying to these experiences, these are not people who actually died and came back. These are, by definition, near-death experiences. So it still doesn\u2019t establish anything at all about consciousness surviving after death. We\u2019ve never had an example in history of somebody who was actually certifiably dead and his consciousness has survived.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: See, now hold on. Because right there Dr. Parnia would strongly disagree with you. And the best research on this\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Yeah, like what? Give me an example.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay. First of all, his definition of death, which is as good as I\u2019ve heard, is to say to look at cardiac arrest patients and to know that when someone has a cardiac arrest, this is not a heart attack, this is cardiac arrest. Your heart has stopped. We know within 10 to 15 seconds your brain stops. We know that if we do nothing, you\u2019re dead. So his comment is that that person, by any means that we normally talk about it, is dead. That person is dead. So any experience that they have that we can tie to happening after that period of cardiac arrest is unexplainable with conventional medicine. And we see\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: As the good doctor should know, there is actually quite a bit of disagreement about where exactly the line of certain death is. Cardiac arrest is strictly one of the criteria. Certain brain activities are another one of those criteria. The two don\u2019t necessarily go together as you pointed out. There is the line between one and the other. But the point is, before I accept that the very extraordinary notion that consciousness can survive death, I want to make sure that somebody\u2019s absolutely and completely dead.\n\nI don\u2019t know of any example, unless you obviously believe in the story of the resurrection of Jesus, of any example at all in which we actually have a documented instance of somebody who was dead by anybody\u2019s independent observer understanding of death and then he came back. We just don\u2019t have it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, the best research that we do have or one of the best pieces of research was done by Dr. Penny Sartori, who did a prospective study of people who had cardiac arrest in the hospital and then asked them to recount their resuscitation process.\n\nSo this is after they\u2019ve had cardiac arrest. How were they resuscitated? And what she found was in the two groups she looked at, one group that had near-death experiences, the other group that didn\u2019t, the group that had near-death experiences was dramatically more accurate in recounting their resuscitations. Now this is the kind of evidence that we normally accept; we normally say that\u2019s suggestive of the hypothesis.\n\nAnd what you seem to have done, and I would say, getting back to this extraordinary claims/extraordinary proof thing\u2013although people who listen to this show regularly will cringe at me launching into this topic again\u2014I don\u2019t think that comes into play. That\u2019s fine for the general public to say, \u201cHey, you need extraordinary proof before you believe anything.\u201d\n\nBut other than that, scientists have built-in, they\u2019ve internalized extraordinary claims/extraordinary proof. That\u2019s how the peer review process works. That\u2019s how people are accepted or promoted inside of science, by offering extraordinary proof or making extraordinary claims. So we can\u2019t apply that layer on top of things as an observer, as like you said, like an \u201carmchair\u201d scientist saying, \u201cWait, that\u2019s an extraordinary claim.\u201d\n\nBy whose means do we determine what\u2019s extraordinary? That\u2019s the whole purpose of science, is to remove us from the bias and prejudices that we feel in making these kinds of subjective evaluations.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: No. I think that we have a different understanding of science and how it works. The standard of extraordinary\u2014let me put it another way. Let\u2019s get away from the standard phrase, the Carl Sagan phrase. Let me put it in more rigorous framework, which in fact I tried to do in one of the chapters in the book.\n\nOne of the most widely accepted ways in both theoretical science and philosophy of science these days, thinking about the relationship between claims and evidence, is the Bayesian framework. So Bayesian theory which is very wide-spread in statistical analysis decision-making theory and so on and so forth, and it\u2019s now being used in several other areas of science. It\u2019s actually a very simple theorem in probability research, probability theory, and it essentially explains what is the relationship between degree or strength of belief in a particular notion, whatever the notion is. A hypothesis, for instance, a particular scientific hypothesis, and the evidence that is available.\n\nAnd the Bayesian framework not only tells you what the relationship is between belief and evidence, it also tells you what is the rational way of changing your belief when the evidence changes. Because one of the things we need to take into account of course, that the evidence does change over time. Science proceeds not just because people have new ideas, but also because new data come in. New facts come in that need to be explained by either the old hypothesis or by a new hypothesis.\n\nNow if we adopt a Bayesian framework, all that it says is that it rigorously quantifies the older idea that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. In fact, the Bayesian framework says that the claims have to be proportional to the evidence.\n\nAnd what I\u2019m saying is that in this particular case, I just don\u2019t see from my reading of the literature that the claims are even close to being proportional to the evidence. The claim is really extraordinary because we do not have any reason to believe, or again, any compelling evidence to believe that consciousness\u2014whatever it is and however it works\u2014survives bodily death.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But I just cited you several\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026and you\u2019ve cited nothing. I mean, you\u2019ve come back with nothing other than to say it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s overwhelming, believe me, believe me. Give me something to sink my teeth in. Give me the data. And tell me how the data\u2014how this new data has informed or changed your view along the lines that you just said, because what I see, both from what you\u2019ve written and what you\u2019ve said here, is just a very dogmatic stance\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: First of all, if we want to talk about\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026these guys who take this position are astrologers\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: I\u2019m sorry, but first of all, if we\u2019re going to talk about stands and dogmatism, you haven\u2019t actually given me any evidence, as I\u2019m sure you realize. You just threw in a couple of names there. If we wanted to have this as a serious discussion, then we should email each other whatever references we feel are compelling and then each one of us should go through those references, and then we\u2019re going to be talking about actual looking at evidence.\n\nThe fact that you can throw me a name, I can throw you another name. As I said, ask Steve Novella. You said, I asked him. Well, as far as I know he\u2019s one of those people that actually knows these literatures to a good degree. And he\u2019s a medical doctor, incidentally. So he can actually address those issues much better than I can.\n\nI\u2019m asking, however, a much more basic question, which is regardless of which authorities one can cite in favor or against, neurobiology in general\u2014and biology in fact even more fundamentally, and cognitive science and I would add even\u2014I\u2019m going to throw into the mix also\u2014philosophy of mind. All of those fields, the consensus in all of those fields is that there is, in fact, no evidence of decoupling consciousness from physical activities of the brain.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we understand consciousness. It doesn\u2019t mean that we have a good mechanistic explanation for what\u2019s going on, but it is something that philosophers of mind refer to as the \u201cno ectoplasm clause.\u201d The no ectoplasm clause is the idea that whatever consciousness is, it seems to depend on the brain. If you shut down the brain it goes away. And if you shut down the brain permanently, it doesn\u2019t come back.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: If what you\u2019re asking for and suggesting, and I\u2019m all for this, because I\u2019ve found in doing this show that really one show is never enough. One show kind of tees up the topics, and as you said, I totally agree with you and I wasn\u2019t trying to ambush you with a bunch of quotes and references that you can\u2019t respond to off the top of your head because that doesn\u2019t prove anything on my side or detract anything from your side. I\u2019m happy to engage in that. I\u2019m happy to send you those references and structure a debate around that topic. Are you open to doing that?\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Yeah, although as I mentioned a few minutes earlier, I\u2019m not actually the best person to do that. I do believe in expertise. You see, one of the chapters in the book is about expertise.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, you can get any experts you want to help you. I\u2019m just saying, are you the guy\u2014are you willing to step forward and say\u2014I\u2019m certainly not an expert, either, so I\u2019m going to be relying on experts to coach me. Are you willing to engage in that?\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Well, instead of doing that, we can do that if you like, but instead of\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: \u2026having two non-experts doing that, why don\u2019t you actually ask two experts? Get one of your people, the people that you mentioned before and get him up against somebody like Steve Novella or Ken Frasier, the editor of Skeptical Inquirer, and see what happens at that point. Those are people who actually\u2014allegedly at least\u2014know the literature.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019d rather do it with you. You\u2019re right here. We\u2019ve opened up the dialogue. I\u2019d rather see it through. And I\u2019m happy to follow through with that if you are.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Well, clearly we can\u2019t do that today because that would require\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Right. No, no, no. We\u2019ll schedule it a month or two out, whatever feels right. I\u2019ll send you the references and you know what I think would be interesting and stimulating along the lines of the book, Nonsense on Stilts, I think it\u2019s almost like a case study and we can publish it as we\u2019re going, as we\u2019re accumulating data. And then we\u2019ll kind of cap it up with a discussion about it, and I\u2019m sure it will be\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Well, you can send me this stuff and we can talk about it. It seems however, honestly, a fairly bizarre proposition because if in the spirit of Nonsense on Stilts, I am suggesting that if the controversy is about expertise, then you have to ask the experts. Now neither you nor I are experts in this particular area, so it seems like we will be talking about just by quoting second resources. Is that a\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: \u2026really good reason, I mean, a way to go about it?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But you\u2019re the one who wrote, \u201cThis stuff should take care of the whole paranormal mumbo-jumbo.\u201d You\u2019re the person who\u2019s put themselves out forward with making these\u2014and you said right after that, \u201cI stand by that.\u201d So that\u2019s all I\u2019m asking you to do is stand by it.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Alex, there is no contradiction between the two statements and it seems to be clear to me, clear that there shouldn\u2019t be any contradiction. I am also say\u2014let me give you another example that is exactly along similar lines. In the book, as you know, I take a strong stance in favor of the notion of climate change. But I don\u2019t do that on the basis of my understanding of climate science because I\u2019m not a climatologist. I\u2019m not in atmospheric physics.\n\nWhat I do is I do what any good skeptic would do. That is you go to the sources, to the actual experts, you look at what they\u2019re saying and say, \u2018Well, is there a consensus within that community?\u2019 And if the answer is yes there is, then the best bet for somebody who does not have technical expertise in that area is to say, \u2018Look, unless there is in fact a controversy within the scientific community, my best bet is to go with the current consensus,\u2019 of course with the understanding that every consensus in science is provisional.\n\nSo where I take stands that are, in fact, based on my own expertise is where my expertise belongs, and that expertise is in evolutionary biology. So if we\u2019re talking about evolution versus creationism, we can do ten shows on that. I have no trouble with that. Or in philosophy of science. If we\u2019re talking about the epistolary of science, if we\u2019re talking about the limits and positive aspects of science, we can also do that. For everything else, including what I say in the book, my position is precisely that. The best that a non-technical expert can do is to look at the consensus if there one in the relative community of experts.\n\nBy the way, before some of your listeners might actually raise these issues, I\u2019m going to preempt it if you don\u2019t mind. Whenever I say, \u201cOh, you should listen to what the experts are saying,\u201d I am accused of committing a logical fallacy, which is the argument from authority. And I\u2019d like to clear up what the issue there is because for a philosopher to be accused of committing a logical fallacy, it\u2019s really an ironic thing and sure to be embarrassing if it were true. So the argument from authority of course, is a fallacy when you use it this way, if you\u2019re saying that it necessarily follows from a scientific consensus or from what an authority says that what that authority says is true.\n\nSo if I were to say that, \u201cYou know what? I know for certain that climate change is real. Why? Because the experts say so,\u201d that would definitely be an example of a logical fallacy. You cannot derive certain knowledge, you cannot derive consequentially, absolutely certain knowledge from the fact that there is agreement within a certain community of experts because of course, the history of science shows that the community of experts can be wrong.\n\nWhat I am saying instead is what I think is a very rational and in fact, even common sensical position which is understanding that whatever concerns science reaches is in fact provisional, your best bet as a non-technical expert is to look at whether there is a consensus and if there is a consensus, go with it.\n\nThat seems to be, to me, rather uncontroversial, and it seems to me therefore, as a kind of service to the kind of debate that we\u2019re having that when the two of us can have a debate as non-experts. We can keep throwing at each other names and citations, but the fact of the matter is I am not an expert on consciousness and you\u2019re not an expert in cognitive science, so the best\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hold on, though. I let you go on there for a while, but hold on. You are an expert\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026by virtue of Nonsense on Stilts and how to tell science from bunk. And you are a guy with three PhDs and I\u2019m a PhD drop-out, so I think we ought to be able to at least demonstrate how someone would sort through this material. It doesn\u2019t have to be antagonistic. I don\u2019t have anything against you and I think we\u2019ve got a nice conversation here and you\u2019re obviously a very intelligent guy and a likeable guy. I\u2019ve listened to your podcasts.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But I think it\u2019s useful to show how we sort through this stuff and how we throw out certain pieces of information and what information we include. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting we do. I\u2019ll be happy to send you that and we\u2019ll just see how the process goes. You\u2019re not committing yourself to doing anything, but\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: No, I understand. I mean, I\u2019m curious to see the material that you send me. I\u2019ll look at it and we can do a followup. All I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually the best way to proceed, but if that\u2019s the way you\u2019d like it, we can do it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well considering I\u2019ve had on just about every expert I can think of, I mean I\u2019ve had Steve Novella on the show. He\u2019s not really an expert in near-death experience at all. But I\u2019ve had on Kevin Nelson, who\u2019s a skeptic and has published in near-death experience. I\u2019ve had on Michael Persinger. I\u2019ve had on Jeffrey Long. I\u2019ve had on Peter Fenwick. I\u2019ve had on Penny Sartori. So I\u2019ve tried to reach out to the experts. I\u2019m not talking to kind of high-level\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Did you ever have them in the context that you\u2019re talking about? Because you\u2019re suggesting a debate between the two of us. Did you have in the context of a discussion between a proponent and an opponent of the notion?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over and over again.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: And what happened? On the same show you mean?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What we\u2019ve done, and it really works better, is threaded shows. So one person comes on and presents theirs. So I\u2019ve had, for example, Kevin Nelson come on from the University of Kentucky. His theory on near-death experience is REM intrusion. He came on and presented his. Had Dr. Jeffrey Long come on, present a rebuttal. Invited Dr\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Right. I understand, so that\u2019s the way it\u2019s usually done. But what I\u2019m saying is that first of all, actually I\u2019m\u2014I guess\u2014this is your show so you do things as you like. But I\u2019m actually suggesting that that\u2019s not the best way to do it because\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019ll tell you why it is the best in my opinion. This is totally stylistically show-wise. If you don\u2019t, you wind up with as we naturally do here because we both are enthusiastic about the subject and have a lot to say, but you wind up kind of stepping over each other. You can\u2019t completely make your points, and it turns into a sound byte pro versus con, point versus counterpoint, and I think you lose the real depth that I\u2026\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: But that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re suggesting the two of us would do.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think we can do it in a different way. I think there\u2019s a number of different ways to do it, and I\u2019m totally open to doing it in that way, where I give you total free reign to speak or what I\u2019ll probably do is present a case. I\u2019ll kind of make my pitch out there and then leave that out there and then invite you to\u2014you can do it on your podcast, if you like. You can present your rebuttal and then we can kind of go from there.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: That\u2019s definitely a possibility. Anyway, should we move on to another topic or\u2026?\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: I don\u2019t know. We can stay on this for a few more minutes, but it seems like it kind of\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, no, I would love to and there\u2019s many, many other topics I would love to talk about. I do feel like we\u2019ve used up a lot of your time. We\u2019re at 52 minutes here in the conversation. Let me ask you as we begin to wrap things up, how things are going with Nonsense on Stilts? Obviously, it\u2019s a book that\u2019s getting some attention and seems to be reviewed well. How\u2019s it going for you?\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: It\u2019s going all right. It\u2019s an interesting reception. For instance, a very positive review in The New Scientist and then there\u2019s a very negative review in The Chronicle of Higher Education, which turned out to be written by somebody who is a professor of philosophy, I think at the University of Pennsylvania, and really, really disliked it. It was interesting the reason he disliked it. He thought that I was a \u201cscience warrior\u201d as he put it. It was one of these scientistically-oriented people who just is a close-minded defender of science.\n\nAnd the funny thing is that people on the other side of the debate accuse me of not being enough of a defender of science. My colleague, Jerry Coyne, for instance, at the University of Chicago, constantly says that I\u2019m an accommodationist and a fluffy-thinking kind of guy who doesn\u2019t take enough of a stand.\n\nSo I find it amusing that some of the reactions are, \u2018Oh, this guy is too much of a strong defender of science,\u2019 and some of the other reactions on the other side are, \u2018Well, this guy is not defending science enough.\u2019 I would like to draw the conclusion that I\u2019m doing something right if I\u2019m managing to piss off both sides of the debate. But that may not be the case, I don\u2019t know.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: It\u2019s been an interesting experience from that perspective. We\u2019ll see how the book is going to be doing over the next few weeks and months. It was certainly a lot of fun to write. I learned a lot about topics that I knew only superficially or cursorily about it. It took some time to put something like this together, obviously, as you might imagine.\n\nAnd I definitely enjoy talking to people about these topics because it turns out that every time I that I have these kinds of conversations\u2014I\u2019ve been on several podcasts, I\u2019ve been on a couple of NPR shows and so on\u2014every time that I have a conversation, it\u2019s a different conversation. It\u2019s really interesting because people seem to be picking on different chapters of the book or different themes of the book.\n\nThat makes for an\u2014I don\u2019t want to say endless variety of conversations because of course, it\u2019s a finite one\u2014but it\u2019s a really interesting and varied set of conversations. I\u2019m really enjoying the opportunity to talk about it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Great. Well I think it\u2019s obviously an incredibly important and timely topic in terms of just science in general. I think where we go with the gap that we have in scientific knowledge and how that\u2019s being treated in our society. I think you try your best to address it. It\u2019s very interesting.\n\nI also have to say that I did find and listened to your podcast. The whole thing on accommodationist and whether you\u2019re a true-blue atheist or not kind of thing, I found very interesting. I\u2019d love to get into that sometime and talk about how you can accommodate spiritual beliefs and that or whether that\u2019s appropriate or how that fits in because I think one of the problems\u2014and I think it\u2019ll evolve into that a little bit naturally if we continue this dialogue.\n\nI would submit that one of the problems with near-death experience research is it\u2019s under this pale of spirituality that makes it just a hot button issue that folks can\u2019t really look clearly and think and talk about the data because there\u2019s this fear that it\u2019s going to bring in all these issues of culture war issues in terms of spirituality. So I think the accommodationist thing, and I\u2019d encourage anyone to go\u2014we\u2019ll provide links to your podcast, as well\u2014to go listen to that. I think it\u2019s an interesting dialogue.\n\nDr. Massimo Pigliucci: Yeah. It\u2019s definitely been fun and as I said, I find myself in this bizarre situation where I don\u2019t think of myself as either an accommodationist or a new atheist, which means that I get criticized by both sides. It\u2019s fun. I can take it. I\u2019ve got enough of a broad shoulder to be able to take that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yes, yes, you do.
