This might sound far-fetched, but if the covid pandemic and the resulting bullying that came when people refused the vaccines is anything to go by, it is something that could very well become a reality very soon.\n\nYou will be tracked, vaccinated, and controlled down to the very last detail, including where you live, how many children you have, what they are taught in school, and what you eat.\n\nThe biggest way they will get us all, is their total control over the money supply.\n\nA new report from the Bank of International Settlements estimates that up to 90% of national central banks are at least in the planning stages for launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC). \u2026\n\nThis echoes a March report from the IMF, which claimed over one hundred nations are at least in the planning stages of releasing their own CBDC.\n\nIt seems programs of government-issued digital money have been gaining momentum all around the world since at least 2020, and apparently, now they exist in over half the countries on the planet.\n\n\u201cNine out of 10 central banks are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and more than half are now developing them or running concrete experiments. In particular, work on retail CBDCs has moved to more advanced stages,\u201d the report states.\n\nNine out of ten countries are looking to move toward implementing a digital currency controlled by the central bank. So, instead of printing fake fiat cash like they do now, they will just have it digitally. This means it will be far easier to control, as everyone will have to use their banking systems to purchase goods, pay for bills etc. Brazil and Namibia have just announced plans to move towards a digital currency.\n\nBlacklisted News also noted that one part of digital currencies that is rarely talked about, is the potential for the currency to be \u2018programmable\u2019 \u2014 \u201ca hypothetical feature of digital currency which would allow the issuer to set limits and controls over its use.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentially, any CBDC would give either the state, the central bank or the corporation issuing the money as wages the power to control how and where the money is spent,\u201d the report stated, suggesting that would amount to \u201cthird-party control over your money.\u201d\n\nThis has massive implications for the very idea of individual liberty. Given how the last two years have gone, it\u2019s not at all hard to imagine how such a system could be abused.\n\nHalting payments to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d, garnishing wages to \u201cfight climate change\u201d or individual financial sanctions because you aren\u2019t vaccinated.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Global Elites Pushing Towards Digital Currency - Liberty Planet", "description": "Stocks are rapidly declining and individual retirement accounts have lost hundreds of billions and it is all thanks to Joe Biden and his witless administration.
