From The Post Millennial: \u201cOn Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if China were to ally itself with Russia in the ongoing war in Ukraine, it would mark the start of World War III. \u201cIf China allies itself with Russia, there will be a world war, and I do think China is aware of that,\u201d he stated. Zelensky\u2019s comments came the same day Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv and pledged another $500 million in aid and further sanctions on Russia. On Monday night, former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard responded to Zelenksy\u2019s comments saying, \u201cHe [Zelenksy] is doing everything he can to bring us [The United States] and NATO into this war.\u201d \n\n Former President Trump on Tuesday released a video expressing, \u201cWorld War III has never been closer than it is right now.\u201d \u201cThese people have been seeking confrontation for a long time, much like the case in Iraq and other parts of the world. And now, we\u2019re teetering on the brink of World War III.\u201d And Luke Rudkowski asked, \u201cCan we please stop racing towards World War III?\u201d in response to a Feb 21 The New York Times piece:\n\n\u201cWorld War III solves a lot of issues (for the perpetrators),\u201d attested former Blackrock portfolio manager Edward Dowd.\u201cWhy is our administration insanely running into a World War III situation?\u201d Dowd asked. He answered, \u201cAnd I suspect \u2014 I\u2019m a cynical guy \u2014 that World War III solves a lot of issues: solves the sovereign debt crisis and solves the vaccine murder that\u2019s gone on \u2014 wipes a bunch of stuff off the map \u2014 and directs everyone\u2019s attention to a world war.\u201d Edward expressed that he hopes he\u2019s wrong, but that scenario is \u201cdefinitely in play. And the capital markets may be starting to sniff this out.\u201d \n\n He elaborates. \u201cThe U.S. Dollar in a World War III situation would go up quite a bit. And the dollar, the DXY, the basket of currencies, bottomed about two weeks ago and is starting to go up. We think it put in a very significant bottom.\u201d But Edward Dowd is not so optimistic about the stock market\u2019s future. \u201cThe stock market is on razor\u2019s edge right now. I don\u2019t like to make predictions, but if I had to guess, the stock market is going to fall apart in the next week or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Mr. Putin has just told us is that the Kremlin now considers nuclear use condition #2 to be true, today..\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, February 21st President Putin gave a speech that was expected to be very significant. After it was delivered, however, most pundits said he didn\u2019t say anything we didn\u2019t already know. Most of them focused on his announcement of the withdrawal from the START II treaty. However, he said something far more significant. What Mr. Putin said, when read through the lens of international law, should be chilling to the West. We would do well to remember that Mr. Putin majored in international law. His speech made a legal case against NATO. First he listed, by my count, 30 different ways in which the Western nations have attacked Russia. These included the expansion of NATO to Russia\u2019s borders, support of terrorists in Russia, economic war, terrorist sabotage of the Nordstream Pipeline, financing of the coup and war in Ukraine, directly assisting Ukraine to attack targets in Russia including Russia\u2019s nuclear bombers, and plotting to destroy and partition Russia into pieces. Nestled in the middle of these was an important statement. \u201cThis means they plan to finish us once and for all. In other words, they plan to grow a local conflict into a global confrontation. This is how we understand it and we will respond accordingly, because this represents an existential threat to our country.\u201d Putin\u2019s choice of words is extremely significant in light of Russian nuclear doctrine, which states that nuclear weapons could be used by Russia \u201cin response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.\u201d Among the 30 points of evidence of the American war on Russia, Mr. Putin listed several cases of American use of conventional weapons against Russian territory through Ukraine as the thinly veiled proxy, and stated that this represents an \u201cexistential threat to [the Russian State].\u201d What Mr. Putin has just told us is that the Kremlin now considers nuclear use condition #2 to be true, today. This statement was accompanied by two related actions. The day before the speech Russia tested a Sarmat II ICBM. And at the end of the speech, Mr. Putin announced that Russia shall immediately withdraw from the START II treaty, which limits the number and range of their nuclear missiles. These three statements and events together should tell the collective West that Russia has just said \u201cGet off my porch!\u201d, and cocked the forty-five. This doesn\u2019t mean that Russia is going to strike the USA tomorrow morning. But, we are definitely now teetering on the cliff\u2019s edge of nuclear war.\n\n\u201cEven before the start of the SMO, there were negotiations\u2026on the supply of air defense systems\u2026 We remember Kyiv\u2019s attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s much awaited address to the Russian Federal Assembly on Tuesday should be interpreted as a tour de force of sovereignty.The address, significantly, marked the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s official recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, only a few hours before 22 February, 2022. In myriad ways, what happened a year ago also marked the birth of the real, 21st century multipolar world. Then two days later, Moscow launched the Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine to defend said republics. Cool, calm, collected, without a hint of aggression, Putin\u2019s speech painted Russia as an ancient, independent, and quite distinct civilization \u2013 sometimes following a path in concert with other civilizations, sometimes in divergence. Ukraine, part of Russian civilization, now happens to be occupied by western civilization, which Putin said \u201cbecame hostile to us,\u201d like in a few instances in the past. So the acute phase of what is essentially a war by proxy of the west against Russia takes place over the body of Russian civilization. That explains Putin\u2019s clarification that \u201cRussia is an open country, but an independent civilization \u2013 we do not consider ourselves superior but we inherited our civilization from our ancestors and we must pass it on.\u201d A war dilacerating the body of Russian civilization is a serious existential business. Putin also made clear that \u201cUkraine is being used as a tool and testing ground by the west against Russia.\u201d Thus the inevitable follow-up: \u201cThe more long-range weapons are sent to Ukraine, the longer we have to push the threat away from our borders.\u201d Translation: this war will be long \u2013 and painful. There will be no swift victory with minimal loss of blood. The next moves around the Dnieper may take years to solidify. Depending on whether US policy continues to cleave to neo-con and neoliberal objectives, the frontline may be displaced to Lviv. Then German politics may change. Normal trade with France and Germany may be recovered only by the end of the next decade. All that brings us to the games played by the Empire of Lies. Says Putin: \u201cThe promises\u2026of western rulers turned into forgery and cruel lies. The west supplied weapons, trained nationalist battalions. Even before the start of the SMO, there were negotiations\u2026on the supply of air defense systems\u2026 We remember Kyiv\u2019s attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.\u201d Putin made it clear, once again, that the element of trust between Russia and the west, especially the US, is gone. So it\u2019s a natural decision for Russia to \u201cwithdraw from the treaty on strategic offensive weapons, but we don\u2019t do it officially. For now we are only halting our participation to the START treaty. No US inspections in our nuclear sites can be allowed.\u201d\n\u2022 Russia Sees Events In Ukraine As War With West For Survival \u2013 Envoy (TASS)\n\n\u201cOur opponents have not yet gotten over their futile illusions of defeating a nuclear power..\u201d\n\u2022 Talks Should Be Held With Washington, Not Kiev \u2013 Russian UN Envoy (TASS)\n\nIn way over his head.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has claimed that China is preparing to step up its support for Russia, saying the People\u2019s Republic may seek to back Moscow\u2019s efforts in Ukraine. Beijing rejected the charge, calling it \u201cgroundless speculation.\u201d Speaking to the Associated Press for an interview on Wednesday, Stoltenberg was asked whether the US-led military bloc had seen any indication that China might provide weapons or other assistance to Russia. \u201cWe have seen some signs that they may be planning for that, and of course NATO allies, the United States, have been warning against it because this is something that should not happen,\u201d he said, insisting Beijing must not take any role in the conflict in Ukraine. The NATO chief went on to argue that the alliance is \u201cno party\u201d to the hostilities, even while stressing that it would support Kiev for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d in order to \u201censure that Ukraine prevails.\u201d China was quick to respond to Stoltenberg\u2019s comments, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin stating that his country \u201cstands on the side of peace\u201d in regard to Ukraine, while accusing the NATO head of \u201csmears\u201d and \u201cgroundless speculation.\u201d \u201cIt is a known fact that NATO countries, including the US, are the biggest source of weaponry for the battlefield in Ukraine, yet they keep claiming that China may be supplying weapons to Russia,\u201d Wang told reporters during a Wednesday press briefing. \u201cThis is a familiar trick used and exposed soon after the Ukraine crisis broke out.\u201d The spokesman added that while NATO claims to be a \u201cregional defensive alliance,\u201d it has frequently \u201cignored others\u2019 security concerns\u201d and \u201cconstantly sought to reach beyond its traditional defense zone.\u201d Officials in Washington and other Western countries have also alleged that China could soon boost assistance for Russia, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently warning such support would be a \u201cserious problem.\u201d An unnamed European official reached by the AP claimed to have \u201cunambiguous\u201d intelligence showing that Beijing is considering supplying weapons, but said it is unclear whether any decision had been made. To date, officials have provided no evidence to support the allegations. Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow\u2019s military action in Ukraine and continues to keep good ties with the Russian Federation. Last week, Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi announced that the People\u2019s Republic was working on a peace proposal to end the conflict, but the details of the plan have yet to be revealed. While Wang visited the Russian capital for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, the proposal was not discussed, according to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.\n\n\u201cIt was a secret war within a secret war,\u201d Hersh wrote, adding that at least two Navy SEALs were wounded on these missions, and received the Medal of Honor in secret.\u201d Six decades before Norway helped the CIA destroy the Nord Stream gas pipelines, it gave the agency heavily-armed boats that it used to target North Vietnam, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh wrote on Wednesday. Norway\u2019s involvement in this secret war was deeper than previously reported, Hersh claimed. Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist, claimed earlier this month that the CIA sabotaged the Nord Stream lines on President Joe Biden\u2019s orders. The Norwegian Secret Service and Navy reportedly helped CIA divers choose the correct spot to plant the explosives, and ferried the Americans out on a boat to the location, near Denmark\u2019s Bornholm island in the Baltic Sea. Explaining why the US chose Norway as its partner in destroying the Russia-to-Germany gas lines, Hersh said on Wednesday that the \u201cNorwegian Navy has a long and murky history of cooperation with American intelligence.\u201d Historical reports show that Norway sold a number of fast attack boats to the US Navy, which were used by the CIA to conduct clandestine attacks along the North Vietnamese coast. By 1964, prior to the US\u2019 official entry into the Vietnam war, at least two Norwegian sailors had confessed to taking part in these raids, while unconfirmed reports claimed that Norwegian officers and crew manned some of these boats. However, according to Hersh\u2019s source \u201cwithin the intelligence community,\u201d the CIA was given more boats than previously reported. Manned and captained by Norwegian sailors, these vessels carried US Navy SEALs to missions against \u201cfar more aggressive targets that included heavily defended North Vietnamese radar facilities.\u201d While the CIA\u2019s previously reported clandestine attacks were controlled by the American command in Saigon, these more aggressive missions were commanded by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington. \u201cIt was a secret war within a secret war,\u201d Hersh wrote, adding that at least two Navy SEALs were wounded on these missions, and received the Medal of Honor in secret. \u201cThis bit of top secret and heretofore unknown history raises, to this reporter, an obvious question: what else do we not know about the secret operation in Norway that led to the destruction of the pipelines?\u201d Hersh concluded. The Biden administration has described Hersh\u2019s reporting on the Nord Stream explosions as \u201cutterly false and complete fiction.\u201d Moscow considers the destruction of Nord Stream an act of \u201cterrorism,\u201d and Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, argued this week that Hersh\u2019s reporting was \u201cmore than a smoking gun\u201d suggesting US involvement. Prior to Hersh\u2019s initial article, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the explosions on the West, arguing that the US in particular benefited from the attack due to its position as a supplier of LNG to Europe. No, this will not go away. The West is opposed to a transparent investigation into the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. Earlier this week, Moscow\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, argued that evidence of Washington\u2019s involvement was \u201cmore than a smoking gun.\u201d Peskov claimed that \u201cthe need for a thorough and transparent investigation\u201d contrasted with the aims of Western countries that would rather let the mystery go unsolved. \u201cWe see a brick wall of unwillingness from the collective West [for a transparent investigation]. Quite the opposite, we see their desire to avoid the question and gradually let it fade away into the sand,\u201d he added. Peskov insisted the incident should be classified as \u201ca terrorist attack towards energy infrastructure, critically important for the European continent.\u201d According to the Kremlin spokesman, those suspicions were backed by \u201csome surprisingly rather detailed investigations towards who was behind the sabotage.\u201d Nord Stream comprised a set of two 1,200km natural gas pipelines stretching along the bottom of the Baltic Sea between Russia and Germany. On September 26, 2022, the pipelines were rocked by a series of underwater explosions. The incident occurred in the international waters and shut off the supply of natural gas to Germany. The blasts occurred during widespread discussions about limiting gas shipments from Russia to Europe as a response to the conflict in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh claimed the sabotage was a \u201ccovert sea operation\u201d planned and executed by the US with assistance from Norway. The reporter cited an anonymous source \u201cwith direct knowledge of the operational planning.\u201d The US denied those claims, with White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson calling them \u201cutterly false and complete fiction.\u201d Denmark, Germany, and Sweden are currently investigating the incident. Peskov called Russia\u2019s exclusion from their ongoing probe detrimental to \u201cestablishing the truth and determining responsibility.\u201d On Tuesday, the Russian and Chinese ambassadors to the UN demanded a transparent international investigation into the matter. \"Sweden has perhaps the most to tell the world about the [Nord Stream] crime scene, which its divers investigated. Yet instead of sharing this information globally, Sweden has kept the results of its investigation secret\u2026\" pic.twitter.com/1R4zGwKeA8 They await the official presentation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi did not discuss Beijing\u2019s yet-to-be-unveiled peace proposal for the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev, the ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cOur Chinese partners explained their thoughts on the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, as well as their approaches to its political resolution,\u201d she said. The official added \u201cthere were no talks of any specific \u2018plan\u2019.\u201d Wang first mentioned his \u201cpeace proposal\u201d at the Munich Security Conference last week. \u201cWe will put forth China\u2019s position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis,\u201d the diplomat announced. Wang warned that he knew that \u201csome forces might not want to see peace talks materialize\u201d without naming any party in particular. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also commented on the peace proposal at the Monday press briefing. \u201cThe international community is fully aware who is calling for dialogue and striving for peace, and who is fanning the flames and stoking confrontation,\u201d the diplomat said. He then encouraged the US to \u201cseriously reflect on the role it has played\u201d in the Ukrainian conflict so far. On Tuesday, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said that a \u201cposition paper\u201d with China\u2019s consistent views on the conflict would be released \u201cwithin days.\u201d Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky commented on the plan during a press conference on Tuesday, saying that he had his own \u201cpeace formula\u201d supported by a large number of states. Zelensky was apparently referring to the so-called \u201810-point peace plan\u2019 that was presented by him at the G20 summit in November. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Moscow anticipated a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping once Beijing had completed items on its domestic agenda. \u201cWe assume that we will realize our plans regarding face-to-face meetings, which will give an additional boost to our relations,\u201d Putin added. He hanged AND shot himself. And then ate the gun? \u201cAmmunition and a gun case were found in Middleton\u2019s vehicle \u2014 but the weapon itself never turned up.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s report on the disturbing scene where a top Bill Clinton advisor with ties to Jeffrey Epstein was found shot and hanged from a tree has finally been released, prompting sleuths to question why the death was ruled a suicide. Mark Middleton, 59, was a special advisor to the former president in the 1990s, authorizing Epstein\u2019s visits to the White House seven out of the 17 times the infamous pedophile met with top government officials there. Additionally, he was also on the flight logs of Epstein\u2019s private jet. According to the Perry County sheriff\u2019s office, Middleton was found dead on May 7, 2022 with a gunshot wound to his chest and an extension cord tying his neck to a tree in Perryville, Arkansas. \n\n As obtained by the Daily Mail, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Jeremy Lawson\u2019s firsthand report on the mysterious death claims that \u201cI could see what at first appeared to be a man sitting near a tree, as my eyes focused better, I could see a rope of some type going from the tree limb to the male.\u201d Middleton\u2019s body was found at the Heifer Ranch, after worker Samantha McElroy called police after finding Middleton\u2019s abandoned black BMW SUV at the property. \u201cI could see that he had a gunshot wound to the chest and that he had a knot tied in an extension cord that was around his neck and it was attached to the limb directly above him,\u201d Lawson added. Ammunition and a gun case were found in Middleton\u2019s vehicle \u2014 but the weapon itself never turned up. Despite the confusing details of the case, Sheriff Scott Montgomery said Middleton had apparently shot himself in the chest with a shotgun and also somehow hung himself, reported the Arkansas Times. According to the outlet, the late presidential advisor\u2019s family said he \u201cwas being treated for depression\u201d before his death. Despite unsealing the sheriff deputy\u2019s report nine months after Middleton\u2019s death, Circuit Judge Alice Gray granted a request from his family to keep the crime scene photos sealed. \u201cThe Court finds that since Mr. Middleton\u2019s death, the Middletons have been harassed by individuals with outlandish, hurtful, unsubstantiated, and offensive conspiracy theories regarding Mr. Middleton, his death, and his family, which have caused the Middletons immense harm and anguish,\u201d the decision reads. \n\n \u201cThese same individuals have indicated and communicated that they will attempt to obtain the File, including Media Content depicting Mr. Middleton\u2019s body and the scene of his death, by way of an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) request,\u201d the judge continued. \u201cThe purpose of this Order is to prevent further irreparable injury to the Middletons.\u201d Middleton left the White House in February 1995. The following year, a White House investigation determined that he had \u201cabused his access to impress business clients\u201d leading him to be \u201cbarred from the executive mansion without senior approval,\u201d reported the Daily Mail. He has denied those accusations. \u201c..Western capitalist ideology has been so successful in setting material, technological progress as the criterion of \u201ca new civilisation\u201d..\u201d\n\u2022 The Crusades of the Virtuous (Hoppe) The cultural hegemony of the unipolar power is particularly visible in its media events: \u201cinternational\u201d festivals, extravaganzas, gala ceremonies, etc. A glaring example of this is the tireless and desperate placement of the sniffling buffoon Zelensky at almost all the recent \u201ccultural\u201d events\u2026 be they the film festivals of Cannes, Venice, Berlin, ceremonies such as the Golden Globe Awards, the Grammys or music festivals such as Glastonbury. Zelensky has now become the obligatory sprig of parsley for every neoliberal dish. A brand has been created of him. He is probably the most widely seen public figure in the world today. He is the icon of the times: a pathetic, empty puppet, pumped with unlimited cash and drugs, posing as an endearing emissary of the world\u2019s conscience. His most recent video appearance at the grand inauguration of the Berlin Film Festival was met with cheers and standing ovations by the entire audience whose applause remained throughout his speech \u2026 especially when he declared: \u201cCulture chooses a side when it decides to speak out against evil\u2026 and it takes a side when it remains silent and in fact helps the evil.\u201d One of the \u201chighlights\u201d of this self-righteous festival so far is a documentary on Zelensky made by Sean Penn entitled \u201cSuperpower\u201d. At the end of its premiere the audience once again rose obsequiously to its feet to give both Penn and his collaborators a standing ovation. Just three years ago the Berlinale greeted war criminal Hillary Clinton as a star. This year\u2019s Berlinale rolled the red carpet out for NATO with full condemnation of their enemies Russia, Iran, China and Belarus; even the mascot \u2013 the Berlinale bear \u2013 appeared in sky blue and yellow, the Ukrainian national colours. [..] Outside the grand \u201cBerlinale Palast\u201d, climate activists had glued themselves to the legendary Red Carpet. Two days later the same carpet welcomed a silent protest featuring sombre-looking expatriate Iranian actresses in support of the regime-change activists in Iran entitled \u201cWomen Life Freedom\u201d. With the exception of Sean Penn\u2019s eulogy of the Ukraine and its jester, there is little press coverage of the films at the festival\u2026 Will any be remembered in the future as noteworthy works of art? Because Western capitalist ideology has been so successful in setting material, technological progress as the criterion of \u201ca new civilisation\u201d and in commoditising virtues and morals all over the world, it has become a creed for many to follow\u2026 It sets global dictates and trends (e.g.: global warming, gender fluidity, cancel culture, re-adaptations of history, colour revolutions, etc.). And, in the absence of spirituality, many people follow these global trends and dictates religiously in order to secure an \u201cidentity\u201d in the modern world. \n\n Unusual friendship between a female grey wolf and a male brown bear.
