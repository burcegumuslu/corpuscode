Garbis suggested the victims\u2019 attorneys refile. However, to do so the families had to outline the events of the experiment \u201cincluding how and when the victims were experimented on, as well as the way in which it impacted their spouses, children, and grandchildren.\u201d1\n\n\u201cThe stories shared in the lawsuit are disturbing at best, dividing the victims into six different categories: people who were infected as part of the experimentation, the estates of these original victims, spouses, first-generation descendants, subsequent generate descendants and other relatives of those who died as a result of the diseases contracted from the studies. At least one story from each category was shared in the complaint, showing just how vast the impact of this experiment currently reaches.\u201d2\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the experiment involved employees and board members from each of the organizations named and a U.S. surgeon general. However, while the U.S. government has apologized to Guatemala \u201c\u2026the private institutions have not and have fought this every step of the way.\u201d3 (Johns Hopkins said, \u201cWe feel profound sympathy for the individuals and families impacted, and reiterate that this 1940\u2019s study in Guatemala was funded and conducted by the U.S. Government, not by Johns Hopkins. We will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit.\u201d4)\n\nThe experiment is incredibly similar to the well-known Syphilis Study at Tuskegee- utterly disgusting and a crime against humanity. However, it has been suggested that in this case, many of the infected didn\u2019t even realize what had happened until President Barack Obama\u2019s public apology to the Guatemalan president.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rockefeller Foundation faces $1 billion lawsuit for infecting hundreds with Syphilis", "description": "Score one for justice: at the beginning of the year, a federal judge in Baltimore, Maryland said Johns Hopkins University, Big Pharma drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the Rockefeller Foundation would face a $1 billion lawsuit over their roles in a 1940s U.S. government experiment that gave hundreds of Guatemalans syphilis.\u00a0 RELATED STORY: VIDEO: Inside JD \u2026", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphilis/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2019-01-14T13:44:57-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-01-14T15:10:16-05:00", "updated_time": "2019-01-14T15:10:16-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rock.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rock.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "717"}, "tags": ["World", "Vaccines", "Health", "U.S.", "Vaccine Injury"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bristol Meyers-Squibb And Others Can't Dodge $1 Billion Lawsuit Over 1940s Syphilis Study, Judge Rul\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbCCMA7nGxs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbCCMA7nGxs?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/top-cancer-doctor-resigns-as-editor-of-medical-journal/", "https://healthnutnews.com/rockefeller-university-hospital-knew-their-doctor-was-sexually-abusing-child-patients-for-years/", "https://healthnutnews.com/video-inside-jd-rockefellers-house-where-he-died/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "https://healthnutnews.com/dark-secrets-of-the-rockefeller-family-free-short-documentary/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "https://awarenessact.com/rockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphiliss/", "tg://msg?text=Rockefeller%20Foundation%20faces%20%241%20billion%20lawsuit%20for%20infecting%20hundreds%20with%20Syphilis - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Frockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphilis%2F", "mailto:?subject=Rockefeller%20Foundation%20faces%20%241%20billion%20lawsuit%20for%20infecting%20hundreds%20with%20Syphilis&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Frockefeller-foundation-faces-1-billion-lawsuit-for-infecting-hundreds-with-syphilis%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019-01-14T13:44:57-05:00"}
