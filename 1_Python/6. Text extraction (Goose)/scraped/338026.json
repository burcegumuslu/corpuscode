Non-essential workers are also being encouraged to work from home, while a 2300 local time curfew has been revived.\n\nThere are currently 1.07K active Covid cases in the Seychelles, of which a third have been detected in people given two doses of either AstraZeneca\u2019s or China\u2019s Sinopharm\u2019s vaccine.\n\nIt is unclear what has triggered the surge in cases but testing has detected the South African variant spreading on the islands. Scientists believe the mutant strain can evade immunity and make jabs up to 30 per cent weaker at preventing infections \u2014 but they think Western vaccines should still stop people falling severely ill if they get infected. But because Seychelles is not actively analyzing a large amount of positive tests (something the UK and other countries are doing to monitor the spread of variants) it is difficult to tell exactly which strain has taken hold in the country.\n\nBut the country\u2019s close links to South Africa means it is likely the B.1.351 variant could be behind the rise. Seychelles was added to Britain\u2019s travel \u201cred list\u201d in January along with nine southern African countries and Mauritius in a bid to prevent the UK from importing the strain.\n\nDuring a recent press conference, officials didn\u2019t offer much in the way of detail about what they suspect might be causing the revival.\n\nThe country acted quickly to begin its vaccination program in January, using doses from China\u2019s Sinopharm vaccine that were donated from the UAE. It also received doses of AstraZeneca from India. When Seychelles president Wavel Ramkalawan first announced the country\u2019s vaccination drive, the Seychelles had recorded a total of only 531 coronavirus cases and a single death, according to data from its health ministry. But in the span of four months, that number has risen more than 10x to 6,373 with 146 total deaths. Seychelles isn\u2019t alone: Chile, another country that has been heavily reliant on vaccines developed in China, has also seen rising cases despite its successful inoculation campaign.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Country With World's Highest Vaccination Rate Orders New Lockdown as COVID-19 Cases Surge", "description": "All schools in the country have been closed and sporting activities cancelled for two weeks in the country.", "url": "https://news4achange.com/country-with-worlds-highest-vaccination-rate-orders-new-lockdown-as-covid-19-cases-surge/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-05-06T07:42:05+00:00", "image": "https://news4achange.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rytrytrytrytr-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56992121", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/country-worlds-highest-vaccination-rate-orders-new-lockdown-covid-cases-surge", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2021-05-06T07:42:05+00:00"}
