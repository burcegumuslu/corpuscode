But she made a different choice: on her way out the door, she transferred onto personal accounts and devices over 12,000 files, scores of which contain Pfizer confidential and trade-secret information, and tried covering her tracks repeatedly. She went so far as to provide Pfizer\u2019s security team a decoy laptop, leading Pfizer to believe it was the one she used to download the 12,000 files from her Google Drive account. Forensic analyses confirmed it was not, and Ms. Li (or somebody else, including potentially DOES 1-5) likely remains in possession of the actual computer that contains those 12,000 files.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent Li from using, disclosing, transmitting or altering any confidential information she stole, per .\n\nLi\u2019s tenure with Pfizer began in 2006 at their Global Product Development Group in China, before transferring to the company\u2019s La Jolla, California campus in 2016. She had signed a confidentiality agreement as part of her employment.\n\nHer alleged theft was first detected as part of routine tracking of employee activity on company devices in October, when she transferred 12,000 files from her Pfizer laptop, per the complaint.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 Pfizer In Hot Water After Listing Herzliya Medical Center As Located In \u201cPalestine\u201d\n\u2022 More And More Deaths Emerge From Pfizer Vaccine \u2018Success Story\u2019", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer Employee Stole 12,000 Files Including COVID-19 Vaccine Secrets, Lawsuit Claims", "description": "Originally published on ZeroHedge Pfizer claims that a \u201csoon-to-be-former employee\u201d\u00a0uploaded more than 12,000 files \u2013 including \u201cscores\u201d with confidential information...", "url": "https://southfront.org/pfizer-employee-stole-12000-files-including-covid-19-vaccine-secrets-lawsuit-claims/", "site_name": "South Front", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontEnTwo", "article:published_time": "2021-11-25T10:00:27+00:00", "image": "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pfizer-vax_1.jpg", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "720", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://southfront.org/donate/", "https://s4.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pfizer-vax_1.jpg", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/pfizer-employee-stole-12000-files-including-covid-19-vaccine-secrets-lawsuit-claims", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/pfizer-says-employee-stole-files-with-covid-vaccine-secrets", "https://www.scribd.com/document/542125876/Document#from_embed", "https://www.scribd.com/user/408250710/Zerohedge-Janitor#from_embed", "https://southfront.org/pfizer-in-hot-water-after-listing-herzliya-medical-center-as-located-in-palestine/", "https://southfront.org/more-and-more-deaths-emerge-from-pfizer-vacine-success-story/", "https://southfront.org/donate/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-11-25T10:00:27+00:00"}
