There Probably is an Afterlife looks at deathbed visions, near-death experiences and other scientific evidence suggesting survival of consciousness.\n\nJoin Skeptiko host Alex Tsakiris for an interview with Greg Taylor. During the interview Taylor talks about his research into deathbed visions:\n\nGreg Taylor: That\u2019s what really kicked off my interest in deathbed visions. I read Peter Fenwick\u2019s paper with Hilary Lovelace, Comfort for the Dying: A five-Year Retrospective and One Year Prospective Studies of End of Life Experiences. They surveyed 38 palliative carers, including doctors, nurses, anybody involved in that. Their statistics showed that at least 60% had stories of deathbed visions and the like. It\u2019s more than half of all those carers who report these things.\n\nWhen I went to Uni McConnell in Ireland and there\u2019s an American study that had like 500 participants and they\u2019re all around that 60% to 70% of palliative carers say that they\u2019ve experienced these things, it\u2019s just a massive amount. It\u2019s very common and yet we hardly hear of it. Near-death experiences get all this media attention and deathbed visions don\u2019t seem to rate the same attention.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Why do you suppose that is\u2026 I think one factor is we like the technology angle of resuscitation, and it fits in with our cultural bias about how medicine is advancing. I think that fits into this story. We\u2019re bringing people back and now they can tell these stories.\n\nGreg Taylor: I\u2019d agree with you there. I think that\u2019s probably tied in to as well with the fact that we\u2019d prefer to hear about people living than people dying. We don\u2019t want to confront the fact that people do die all the time.\n\nToday we welcome Greg Taylor to Skeptiko. Greg is the creator of the amazing stalwart of paranormal websites, The Daily Grail, which has been going strong for probably longer than the Internet has been around. Greg also has a new book out now called, Stop Worrying! There Probably is an Afterlife, something that is right up our alley here on Skeptiko.\n\nGreg was a guest on our show over four years ago. It\u2019s a great pleasure to welcome you back, Greg. Thanks for joining me on Skeptiko.\n\nGreg Taylor: It\u2019s a pleasure to be here, Alex.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I thought we might start with, since a lot of people probably are familiar with The Daily Grail but a lot of folks probably aren\u2019t, let\u2019s start there. Tell folks about The Daily Grail, what you do there, what\u2019s been happening there, how it started, just the basic rundown on The Daily Grail website.\n\nGreg Taylor: The Daily Grail is basically a website that\u2019s devoted to news on science and history and anything on the fringes of the mainstream. We don\u2019t go too far. We\u2019re not into the whacked-out territory of people just losing the plot completely. We\u2019re just testing those edges of science and history which a lot of orthodox scientists would say were woo\u2014Randi or someone like that. I don\u2019t think science can move forward unless people keep pushing those boundaries of the edges of science and history. So that\u2019s what the site\u2019s devoted to.\n\nIt started 15 years ago so it\u2019s been going a long time. It\u2019s just evolved over time. Originally I was more interested in a lot of the history things. That\u2019s what I grew up with. Since then, as time\u2019s gone on, I\u2019ve become more and more interested in matters of consciousness which I think really is the big fringe area of science. As much as science likes to claim they know what\u2019s happening with the mind, really we still have no idea. So that\u2019s taken a lot of my time over recent years and has ended up in the book that I\u2019ve just written.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Why this book? Maybe you answered that earlier when you said you feel like your site, The Daily Grail, has shifted more and more into the consciousness area. Why did you feel a need to tackle this survival of consciousness issue, near-death experience, deathbed experiences, and all the rest?\n\nGreg Taylor: It\u2019s just become an area that has really interested me. The general public knows about near-death experiences. That seems to be news that gets out there in the mainstream. When I started looking at deathbed visions or end-of-life phenomenon, which is a whole chapter, there are just some amazing things in there. Peter Fenwick\u2019s done some amazing work there and researched the things that are showing up.\n\nI think a lot of people weren\u2019t aware of that. Even though they\u2019ve released it there are a lot of people who thought they knew a lot about these topics and they\u2019re coming to me saying, \u201cWow, I did not know that. This is amazing.\u201d The whole goal of the book is to get this information that, if you dig into it a bit, you start seeing just isn\u2019t getting out there to the mainstream.\n\nYou know as well as I do that skeptics are starting to win that whole dialogue in the public by shouting down anything that\u2019s to do with this topic. I just wanted to get a book out there that wasn\u2019t all New Age-ish. It was just going through the actual scientific research and saying, \u201cLook, there seems to be something interesting happening here.\u201d Maybe it is; maybe it isn\u2019t. But we deserve to look at these things more honestly and openly than we are at the moment.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think you did a really nice job of it. First of all, it\u2019s extremely well-written\u2014not that I was surprised that it was well-written. It\u2019s accessible on one hand and on the other hand it has a lot of great content as is evidenced by the more than 20 pages of notes and citations that you\u2019ll find in the back. You must have really done a pretty extensive job of covering your reading list before doing this book.\n\nWhat was your initial plan in terms of the breadth that you were going to tackle with the survival of consciousness issue? We mentioned a couple, near-death experience, deathbed visions, terminal lucidity. How wide did you cast the net initially? How much wider did the net get once you got out there and saw what else there was?\n\nGreg Taylor: That was exactly what happened. I knew a fair bit about mediumship in the last hundred years or so. I\u2019ve researched into that. I was quite familiar with the near-death experience thing. I just dipped into the deathbed vision and it just kept growing and growing. I looked at reincarnation stuff for a while\u2013Ian Stevenson\u2019s material and things that have been done since. Eventually I ended up with what would have been about a 600-page book.\n\nIt was getting away from my goal of just hitting people with these cases and keeping it really simple. I think I cut it down from about 150,000 to 74,000 words. The editing actually took longer than the writing in the end. I was trying to make sure it had punch and it got across to the general reader rather than appealing to guys like you and me who are quite familiar with all the topics already. I wanted it to hit the general readers so they could see these topics. It was a big job. The net grew a lot. Then I started having to chop back a lot. Hopefully in the end I\u2019ve produced something that has that punch for the general reader.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What surprised you the most, Greg? What did you stumble across that really took you by surprise, given that you knew a lot? For people who don\u2019t know The Daily Grail, you\u2019re staying on top of these topics on a daily basis. The Eben Alexander thing hits with near-death experience and you\u2019re all over it; somebody writes a new book or Pim von Lommel comes out with his book years ago and you\u2019re on it. What did you come across that really surprised you?\n\nGreg Taylor: It was the deathbed visions, the end-of-life experiences.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let\u2019s jump right in there. Give folks an example of one or two of the cases that you talk about in the book that you thought were really interesting. If you can\u2019t think of one I\u2019ll tee one up. I like your story about Arthur James Balfour and his story. I guess it\u2019s his niece that really gives the story but it\u2019s a pretty amazing account. If you can recall that one and tell listeners or if you have another favorite one maybe you want to share that.\n\nGreg Taylor: I\u2019m a great lover of that whole Victorian era, the spiritualism and things like that. With mediumship research that I\u2019ve done I\u2019ve read quite a lot of that and I find it quite interesting. When you go back to the deathbed vision material, a lot of people died at home in that era. There seems to be a lot more reportage of these sorts of things.\n\nEven if you just leave alone the whole afterlife topic they\u2019re just beautiful stories of people dying with their families. Some are tales of children dying and the parents are with them. Back then, without vaccines and things like that, a lot of young children died. Quite often some of the stories you read, the whole family of children die just one after another. It\u2019s tragic stuff but they make for great stories. Some of those really touched me.\n\nThe Balfour story, he was the former Prime Minister of the UK. It\u2019s fascinating. Again, another topic that hardly anyone\u2019s heard of. I was reading Archie Roy\u2019s book when I saw it and I was going, \u201cLook at this! Why don\u2019t more people know about this deathbed vision?\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Do you think we could take a minute and read it? I think it would give people a feel for it.\n\nGreg Taylor: I\u2019ll just read an excerpt from the book, which is the start of the chapter and includes some of my introduction.\n\n\u201cArthur James Balfour was a stalwart of British politics at the turn of the 20th Century, serving as both Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and later as the Foreign Secretary. His influence is still felt today by his authoring of the Balfour Declaration of 1917 which supported the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Less well known, though, is the tale of his final days in which the former prime minister and foreign secretary was apparently feted by a diplomatic mission from the undiscovered country.\n\nWith his niece by marriage, Jean Balfour, sitting by his bedside Arthur lay listening to his favorite music, seemingly content with his lot despite his impending appointment with death. With the nurse having retired downstairs and Balfour\u2019s sister, Eleanor Sidgwick, sitting with them in the room, Jean suddenly felt an odd feeling of expectancy, as if anything might happen.\u201d\n\nThen it goes into her account as told in her words.\n\n\u201c\u2026Presently I became aware with a sensation of a mighty rushing wind (which was entirely subjective, as nothing around me was even stirred), that the room was full of a radiant, dazzling light. This I felt rather than saw, as a blind person might do, and I started trembling.\n\nNow it seemed to me that there were people there too; they had no concern with me, they were invisible; but I knew that they were clustered about A.J.B.\u2019s bed, and that their whole attention was concentrated on him. They seemed to me to be most terribly eager, and very loving and strong; and I recollect feeling a good deal of apprehension because I felt they were there for some purpose, though I did not know what it could be.\n\nI could not stop the trembling, so I was wondering if I ought to go out of the room into the passage for a little while, when it seemed to me that something like a voice within me said, \u2018You are not to go away,\u2019 and I looked at E.M.S (Eleanor Sidgwick) sitting in the armchair to see if she was aware of anything unusual, but she did not appear to be.\n\nThe music came to the passage where the words occur: \u2018And in my flesh shall I see God.\u2019 At that moment my eyes were compelled to look at A.J.B. His face, transfigured with satisfaction and beauty, seemed to express all the glorious vision which both music and words conveyed; and I stared, fully expecting him to die at that moment, and to pass straight into the Heaven that awaited him on all sides.\n\nBut his face changed, and then he was shaken with the seizure that marked the last phase of his illness, and I was filled with terror and distress. Perhaps my shock was the greater for having just been upon such spiritual heights; and the extraordinary thing was that I was vividly aware that the feeling in the room had not changed, that the radiant joy and light still thrilled around him, and that the agonising spectacle of the poor body\u2019s affliction caused no dismay to those unseen ones who watched, but that it was what they had wanted to happen.\n\nThat was what seemed to me so incredible as I fled for the Nurse; and as I ran immediately afterwards to telephone for the Doctor, I was saying over and over to myself, It was intended \u2013 it was intended.\u2019\n\n\u2026Thinking it over afterwards I began to realise that though to my bodily view it was terrible, to those who see the spirit it may have been simply a fierce effort to cast off the body and set free a soul already with them; and since a merciful unconsciousness accompanies the onset of a stroke we do not know, and never will know, into what peace and joy his soul may have receded in that little space\u2026\u201d\n\nSuch a beautiful little anecdote in the words of someone who was there at the time.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And it\u2019s interesting because as you point out, if you\u2019re a skeptic you can dismiss this story. You can dismiss anything. You can say, \u201cOh my gosh, it\u2019s a family member and they wanted to create this.\u201d That doesn\u2019t really make any sense, really. These people are no different than we are today. Why would someone make up this kind of story?\n\nMoreover, the reason that we see a lot of momentum towards this belief that we have is that it is highly suggestive of an afterlife. It\u2019s consistent with so many other accounts that you hear from all kinds of people in all walks of life. It\u2019s so hard to take that in, isn\u2019t it? Because it is such an amazing story. We shouldn\u2019t need thousands of examples. Even though we have a lot of examples we shouldn\u2019t need so many examples of that, should we? It\u2019s an amazing account. I just can\u2019t get over it.\n\nGreg Taylor: The thing that grabbed me about that one was when she introduced it by saying she felt this rush of wind. That\u2019s something else that I\u2019ve researched for quite some time. A lot of people having near-death experiences and other anomalous phenomena feel or talk about a rush of wind hitting them. They use those exact words. That\u2019s what really grabbed my attention.\n\nBeyond any sort of proof of those things, like you said, these are profound experiences and that\u2019s one of the things I ended up coming to in this book. These are life-changing experiences and yet at the moment in modern society they\u2019re being belittled. Again and again in these accounts you find that people didn\u2019t tell about this accounts to other people just because they were afraid of being labeled crazy. Palliative carers and people at deathbeds have these profound experiences and then say, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone for a whole year,\u201d because they thought someone would say, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nWe really need to get out of that habit and start talking about these beautiful experiences again.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You mentioned that a lot of these are recorded from back in the Victorian era but there are also a lot of contemporary accounts, too. I don\u2019t recall while reading your book if you ran across a Diana Archangeli who was a head of hospice at the Kubler-Ross Center in Houston. She\u2019s someone I spoke with. She was not a nurse but a very high-level person in that important hospice group in Houston that really started the whole hospice movement.\n\nShe was in contact with a lot of hospice nurses and collected a whole bunch of these stories and published them in a book. There is a group of hospice nurses for which these accounts are just so commonplace that they\u2019re not even disputed. I challenge any person who is skeptical but still interested in this to go down to your local elder care/hospice organization and buy a cup of coffee for a couple of nurses. Ask them about deathbed visions. I guarantee you won\u2019t get past a couple of sips and they\u2019ll have more stories than can fill a book.\n\nGreg Taylor: That\u2019s what really kicked off that deathbed vision chapter. I read Peter Fenwick\u2019s paper with Hilary Lovelace, Comfort for the Dying: A five-Year Retrospective and One Year Prospective Studies of End of Life Experiences. They surveyed 38 palliative carers, including doctors, nurses, anybody involved in that. Their statistics showed that at least 60% had stories of deathbed visions and the like. It\u2019s more than half of all those carers who report these things.\n\nWhen I went to Uni McConnell in Ireland and there\u2019s an American study that had like 500 participants and they\u2019re all around that 60% to 70% of palliative carers say that they\u2019ve experienced these things, it\u2019s just a massive amount. It\u2019s very common and yet we hardly hear of it. Near-death experiences get all this media attention and deathbed visions don\u2019t seem to rate the same attention.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Why do you suppose that is?\n\nGreg Taylor: I spoke to Michael Barbato, who is a palliative care physician here in Australia, and he was of the feeling that with the end-of-life experiences the person dies afterwards so there\u2019s not this personal testimony. A lot of the time with near-death experiences you have people who can go on TV shows and say, \u201cI died and I came back and this is what I experienced.\u201d End-of-life experiences, generally they go on to die afterwards so you don\u2019t have this testimony. That may be the driving factor behind that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: The other thing I think is a factor is we like the technology angle of resuscitation and it fits in with our cultural bias that we have about how medicine is advancing. I think that fits into this story. We\u2019re bringing people back and now they can tell these stories.\n\nGreg Taylor: I\u2019d agree with you there. I think that\u2019s probably tied in to as well with the fact that we\u2019d prefer to hear about people living than people dying. We don\u2019t want to confront the fact that people do die all the time.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about near-death experience research. You did a very nice job of covering it in the book, as well. What is the state of near-death experience research? Where are we really at in terms of advancing that to the next level, whatever that level is?\n\nGreg Taylor: There are two fronts there. There\u2019s that whole proof-based evidence which I think Sam Parnia\u2019s effort is probably only the real thing that could convince skeptics or orthodox scientists. For those listeners who don\u2019t know, Sam Parnia and colleagues have this study called the AWARE Study. They have targets in rooms where they think people are going to have cardiac arrests and they hope that if they have an out-of-body experience and they get up to the ceiling they might be able to see these targets and then report back. So if someone comes back or two people come back and say they saw the targets that might start changing the whole imminence-based thing\u2014maybe. Skeptics are rather hardcore in their beliefs about that sort of thing.\n\nThen there\u2019s also the side of near-death experience research where it\u2019s more about learning more about how they affect people\u2019s lives. I think Bruce Greyson\u2019s probably right at the coalface there working on that. So you\u2019ve got these two areas and the evidence based is always going to be an uphill battle. I think the AWARE Study is probably the only method of going forward.\n\nYou do have all these veridical accounts of OBEs and Janice Miner Holden has done a great job of assembling lots of those anecdotes but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re ever going to convince the hardcore skeptics, whereas the AWARE Study might start persuading people if they can come back with data. That\u2019s going to be a really hard push. I explain in the book as to how much research needs to be done just to pull out a few OBEs.\n\nI think Bruce Greyson and people like that writing for the general near-death studies who are looking more at the social phenomenon and the personal phenomenon as to how near-death experiences affect people, I think that\u2019s quite interesting as well. It probably gets lost in the mix a bit. People want evidence but there\u2019s this whole other side that it\u2019s a profound experience and how is it affecting people? So yeah.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You\u2019ve touched on this a couple of times already but let\u2019s talk about the culture war debate over consciousness. You start the book, Stop Worrying! There Probably is an Afterlife, with a very nice introduction on the ghost in the machine. In that you not only trace the origins of near-death experience research but of this scientific culture war over consciousness. Frame that up for us a little bit.\n\nOn one side we have this\u2014people get tired of me saying this but\u2014consciousness is an illusion of biological robots side versus this consciousness is fundamental. You talk about some prominent scientists who believe that consciousness is the fundamental building block of the universe. Frame up for us that culture war debate over consciousness and where you think it\u2019s heading.\n\nGreg Taylor: This is something we cover on The Daily Grail quite a lot. That\u2019s one reason for the introduction. I needed to introduce the reader to this debate because in the modern day Richard Dawkins and all that seems to get all the publicity, especially when you read a lot of scientific sources. I just explained how over recent centuries all these different aspects of science have led people more and more away from a spiritual worldview into the view that the physical world is everything and we are just slime on a little piece of rock that orbits the sun and we have a limited lifetime and basically there is no meaning to life.\n\nI then point out that even though that gets all the media, there are a bunch of really good scientists, very highly respected, the likes of Paul Davies who don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case or at least suspect that\u2019s not the case. They see consciousness as something very fundamental in the universe. Us being conscious and then analyzing the universe ourselves seems to be this way of the whole universe waking up and learning more about itself.\n\nThen there\u2019s the aspects of quantum physics where consciousness seems to be really tied into quantum physics. This is something I talked about in another interview recently. It\u2019s amazing when you talk about science and how it\u2019s supposedly concrete facts. It finds out the facts and it reports back the facts.\n\nI went through all the quantum physics literature and it\u2019s quite amazing that you have all these quantum physicists who go from one end of the scale saying consciousness is fundamental and is everything right through to hardcore Materialists who say consciousness has nothing to do with quantum physics. They all state it as if it\u2019s been scientifically proven. It\u2019s quite amazing that that divide, coming from something that you thought was science, you know?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah, but one of my frustrations is sometimes I wonder if we don\u2019t play into that false divide because it is a false divide. I think that if people dig into quantum theory, quantum mechanics experiments, and not only those but the other experiments with consciousness from all over the place, they\u2019ll find that not only is the data heading us toward this idea of the expanded view of consciousness and away from the status quo view that consciousness is an illusion, but the whole thing was just absurd in the first place.\n\nNo one believes that we don\u2019t love our children, that we don\u2019t love our parents, our family. That there isn\u2019t this special connection that we\u2019re able to form. Yet that is totally at odds with this status quo view, as you said, that we are slime on a rock orbiting the sun kind of thing. You won\u2019t really find anyone who truly believes that we don\u2019t have free will and acts as if we don\u2019t have free will. Yet my kids go to school and they don\u2019t beat them over the head with it but it\u2019s underlying all their education about science. So are we playing into this Emperor Has No Clothes kind of thing where we go, \u201cGee, there really is a debate out there and it\u2019s hard to see how we have scientists on one side and scientists on the other.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t we just call it for what it is? It\u2019s a total bunch of bull that just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Consciousness is an illusion and we\u2019re biological robots. We know better than that, don\u2019t we?\n\nGreg Taylor: All of these high profile scientists, Dawkins and the like, they will tell you straight out their beliefs. Whether they believe them fully when they go to bed at night, I don\u2019t know. But they get caught in traps where they say one thing and in the argument you can corner them and say, \u201cWell, if there\u2019s no free will then you\u2019re not making that decision and this argument is absurd.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s this whole other side, too. When you talk to Henry Stapp, a very respected quantum physicist, he\u2019s just beyond the people are wrong here and let\u2019s just get it right. He\u2019s starting to feel that the actual worldview that we\u2019re teaching to kids in school actually could be responsible for a whole degradation of moral standards in the world. If you push that there\u2019s no free will then nobody has any responsibility and you start going down a very deep and dark hole there. So he\u2019s quite outspoken on that fact in his book. He goes into detail about how he thinks the view of integrating consciousness and free will back into the worldview would go a long way to redressing some of the ills of the world.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Although that\u2019s a scientist wanting to stay on top of the heap and saying, \u201cWe still have all the answers. Just let us spin it a different way.\u201d The way I always looked at it is it really undermines science because the average person who, at least we know from a crowdsourcing standpoint, is not dumb. The wisdom of crowds has been established over and over again. People just know that\u2019s bull so they more and more disassociate with the scientific worldview and they think they\u2019re just a bunch of nerds who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. And they\u2019re right. They\u2019ve convinced themselves of something.\n\nI remember talking to Dr. Charles Tart years ago about this and he wrote a book on the end of Materialism. I guess he wrote it a little prematurely since it was a few years ago, but when I spoke to him I said, \u201cHow can this be? How can these guys keep promoting this nonsense?\u201d\n\nHe goes, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what intelligent people can talk themselves into when they don\u2019t check themselves.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. I think the Emperor Has No Clothes. No one believes this; it\u2019s a bunch of crap and I think the general public knows it\u2019s a bunch of crap. It just further undermines their trust in science so they say, \u201cYeah, engineers can do things. I know my phone works.\u201d But when it comes to really big questions I think they turn away from science and go, \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nGreg Taylor: There are certainly belief systems involved. As much as scientists and skeptics say they\u2019re the non-believers, there\u2019s definitely belief systems involved there. I just saw an example the other day. A new paper came out disputing the famous experiments on free will from a while back that was quoted over and over again by anybody against free will. This new paper was pointing out errors and where it\u2019s gone wrong. I\u2019ve seen no coverage of it at all.\n\nRichard Wiseman, who is always on about free will, he\u2019s said nothing about it. Dawkins, nothing about it. If Rupert Sheldrake had come out with a paper arguing for consciousness they would have been all over it and talking about it. So again, it\u2019s a belief system that they will not look at things that dispute their belief systems and they\u2019ll attack anything that disputes their worldview.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You know, I always find things to pick on, Greg, so I guess the thing I\u2019ve got to pick on about the book and want to ask you about is the very first sentence of the book. It\u2019s \u201cYou are going to die.\u201d Which I guess is supposed to be provocative and puts us all in the same boat. We have to kind of wrestle this survival of consciousness thing to the ground but hey, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s probably an afterlife.\n\nI take exception to that. I look at the research; I look at the evidence and I come to the opposite conclusion. You\u2019re not going to die. Isn\u2019t that what the evidence is telling us?\n\nGreg Taylor: Well, there\u2019s two parts to that. The \u201cYou are going to die\u201d bit is just the fact that your physical body is going to die. The point there is that people will ignore in any way they can that their physical body is going to die unless there\u2019s some great step forward in a singularity-type thing. I was just putting that right on the table.\n\nAgain, Michael Lombardo, who I spoke to says we need to embrace more the fact that we will die at some stage. We need to be ready. Even if you believe that our consciousness survives on, people are going to be left behind without physical contact with that person. So there\u2019s something there that needs to be addressed.\n\nBut I agree. The whole point of the book is to say there seems to be evidence that consciousness does survive. The opening was just basically like you said, to hit people in the face straight-up and say, \u201cLet\u2019s address this off the mark.\u201d Also just to get at that fact that you have to start thinking about your death and what that means for how you act your life out. In the final chapter I go back to while you\u2019re here on this planet let\u2019s do good and let\u2019s learn and help people. Let\u2019s do the right thing so that by the time your physical death comes you have lived your life well.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You have a nice quote in there. I forget who it\u2019s from but \u201cOur death really defines our life.\u201d If we didn\u2019t have death looming\u2014the death of our physical body, the question mark of what that annihilation will mean\u2013we would have a whole different conception of our lives. I think until we fully take that in, as you point out, we can\u2019t fully appreciate what we have in this experience, whatever we\u2019re supposed to do with it.\n\nGreg Taylor: When you\u2019re working on a project even, if you have a project that\u2019s open-ended it tends to not get done. It gets shuffled back while you work on other things that are more urgent. So addressing that fact that at some stage your body is going to die means that you should concentrate a lot more in squeezing everything out of every day as you go on rather than getting to your 60s or 70s and realizing you just didn\u2019t achieve what you wanted to in this life on Earth.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: We\u2019re approaching something that you don\u2019t cover a lot in the book and I was wondering why, and that is the spiritual implications for all of this. I mean, they seem to be looming right there but I guess that\u2019s another one of my frustrations with a lot of this research.\n\nTake for example the near-death experience or the deathbed vision experience. People don\u2019t come back from that and say, \u201cOh my gosh, that\u2019s highly evidential of survival of consciousness.\u201d No. They want to talk about God. They want to talk about the white light. The want to talk about the moral meaning, the moral imperative that that brings to their lives. Do we, in general, shy away too much from the obvious spiritual implications for all this?\n\nGreg Taylor: Oh, I think so. There was a lot of that in the material; it just got edited down for the punch to the general readership. I\u2019m just trying to get across to them all of these things. I think David Fontana wrote a book addressing some of this, what happens in the afterlife and what that might mean for how we live our lives. So that\u2019s covered elsewhere. I would have liked to have covered it.\n\nIn the Conclusion I actually mention it a little bit. It was edited down but I was saying that if near-death experiences had started a religion about the way to live spiritually, it\u2019s not a bad way to live, I think. Basically the near-death experiencers come back and say, \u201cWhat you should be doing is loving people and learning as much as you can and doing right by other people.\u201d\n\nLike the life review process\u2014quite often you see it\u2019s experienced from other people\u2019s aspects in how you affected them. It addresses that you should be acting well toward other people.\n\nAll these aspects of the near-death experience would make a great spiritual way forward if you wanted to turn it into a religion. But once things become a religion we know they become corrupt.\n\nThe other thing was at the best of times I feel uncomfortable suggesting to others what they should be doing or what they should be thinking. I like to just put the facts across to people. So the spiritual elements, I feel a little bit uncomfortable addressing them because I\u2019m certainly not a spiritual guru or anything like that. So I just wanted to get the facts of these things across and also transmit a little bit about what near-death experiencers are coming back saying. I address a little bit of that in the Conclusion about living your life well.\n\nI understand your frustration there. It\u2019s something I wrestled with a little bit during the writing of it. It just came down to a decision as to what effect I wanted the book to have, really.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let me jump over on the other side and say I think you did a great job. I think in terms of winning people over I think this book might have a lot more success than a book that\u2019s highly spiritually oriented. You\u2019re right; that does send people askew a little bit because it bumps up against some very important, cherished beliefs that they have.\n\nSo at the end of the day, I think you probably made the best decision. You just present a ton of hard-hitting, well-documented, carefully researched facts that are hard to get past. I think you leave it up to the reader to come to their own conclusions about what to do with it. So maybe you did the right thing.\n\nGreg Taylor: Well, that was the goal. I think once you add the spiritual elements you\u2019ve got it exactly right. You\u2019re bumping up against people\u2019s own beliefs or their own feelings and you\u2019re going to lose most of the skeptics and scientists straightaway. Then the further you go into the spiritual matters the more you might be bumping up against other people\u2019s religious feelings. I\u2019m glad you think it was the right decision.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: So, Greg, tell us how it\u2019s going with the book. What other events are you doing? What\u2019s going on in general? What can we expect to see coming up on The Daily Grail?\n\nGreg Taylor: The book is just rolling along nicely and getting lots of good reviews. It needs word-of-mouth. It\u2019s an independent publication, all done completely by myself so if people can spread the word about it any way they can or want to interview me, I\u2019m open to that. I appreciate any help in getting word out. At the moment sales are strong and 99% of the feedback has been good. The other 1% is from that portion of the skeptics that we know we\u2019re going to get it from.\n\nWith The Daily Grail, this book has taken a lot of time between the researching and the writing and then the editing down; it\u2019s taken up a lot more time than I expected. Next on The Daily Grail is to basically redesign the site and make it a little bit more friendly for mobile phones and the like. I think it\u2019s looking a bit antiquated at the moment but I\u2019m working on basically no money or time so I do what I can.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: The book is Stop Worrying! There Probably is an Afterlife. Our guest has been Greg Taylor, creator of The Daily Grail. We\u2019ll have links to both of those. Do check it out on Amazon. Nothing but splendid, spectacular reviews. I think you\u2019ll really enjoy the book. I think you\u2019ll find a lot of little nuggets in there that you will be amazed that you didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s certainly a book that you could give to someone else and they could gain a lot out of it if they\u2019re not totally up to speed on this field.\n\nGreg, thanks again. Best of luck with the book and thanks for joining me on Skeptiko.\n\nGreg Taylor: Thanks, Alex. It was a pleasure and thank you for the podcast, too. You do a great job on the podcast and you probably don\u2019t get enough kudos for it.
