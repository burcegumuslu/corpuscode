He then asked the \u201cReFounding America\u201d host to explain why.\n\nAccording to Breggin, the WHO is still under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. The latter is a major sponsor of the global health body, stepping in to increase funding for the WHO when former President Donald Trump stopped allocations to it. Gates is also a friend of Beijing.\n\nBoth the CCP and the technocrat feel that the WHO has been effective in organizing and enforcing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown worldwide. It has also been effective in shutting down \u201cunapproved\u201d COVID-19 treatments to patients and forced many to take the vaccine which, in Breggin\u2019s words, turned out to be a terrible instrument of death.\n\nThe \u201cReFounding America\u201d host also pointed out that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus only has a master\u2019s degree in public health. Given that he is not a medical doctor, his close ties with Beijing propelled him to the WHO\u2019s leadership role.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a physician and he\u2019s an ally of the Chinese communists,\u201d he told Newman. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten him in for two straight terms \u2013 [with the] second term, no opposition. Imagine that: No opposition for one of the most powerful jobs in medicine in the world.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Breggin mentioned that the Biden administration is a predatory one that is primarily aligned with the WHO and other globalists. It had proposed and obtained the support of around 40 other countries to amend the rules and regulations governing the WHO. (Related: US proposes amendments to give WHO total control during health emergencies.)\n\nThese amendments, he pointed out, will remove all restrictions to what the WHO director-general \u2013 in this case Tedros \u2013 can do in any country. The consequence of removing these restrictions will become more obvious the moment an international event becomes an emergency of concern to the world, Breggin added.\n\nIf passed, these amendments will allow the WHO\u2019s governing body to take control of parts of a country\u2019s health system \u2013 such as that of the U.S. \u2013 without needing permission from the said country.\n\n\u201cThe agenda behind it all also is to have a national health system under the WHO and no more real national health systems in the world. So, it\u2019s a robbing of U.S. sovereignty, a robbing of our individual state sovereignty and then on down to personal sovereignty,\u201d Breggin explained.\n\nHe ultimately explained to \u201cThe Sentinel Report\u201d host that people are looking at a wholesale attack on the sovereignty of all the world\u2019s nations, specifically that of the West. This, he explained, is because America and other freedom-loving nations stand in the way of a complete global takeover that the globalists are striving for.\n\nWatch the March 17 episode of \u201cThe Sentinel Report\u201d below. \u201cThe Sentinel Report\u201d with Alex Newman airs every Friday at 4-5 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nUN whistleblower says World Health Organization is \u201ctip of the spear\u201d for global tyranny.\n\nReFounding America: WHO cancelled doctors who were saving lives at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 Brighteon.TV\n\nWorld Health Organization positioning to become global health dictator while masses are distracted with \u201clab leaks.\u201d\n\nDr. Francis Boyle tells Mike Adams: WHO Pandemic Treaty is a totalitarian, medical and scientific dictatorship.", "opengraph": {"title": "Alex Newman and Dr. Peter Breggin discuss why WHO is the greatest threat to freedom today \u2013 Brighteon.TV", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2023-03-23-who-the-greatest-threat-to-freedom-today.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "Alex Newman and Dr. Peter Breggin discussed why the World Health Organization (WHO) is currently the biggest threat to freedom\u00a0during the March 17 edition of \u201cThe Sentinel Report\u201d\u00a0on\u00a0Brighteon.TV.
