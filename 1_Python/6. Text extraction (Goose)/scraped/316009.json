How can caring parents wade through the deluge of conflicting opinions and information surrounding the issue to make the most responsible choice?\n\nTwo of our THRIVE team members are about to have babies, and both Kimberly and I have grandchildren whose parents face this issue. A recurring question for all of them, along with parents everywhere, is: \u201cWhat justifies the risk of an adverse reaction?\u201d Is there enough evidence that vaccines really do prevent deadly, dreaded diseases to justify the possible brain damage, infertility or death if \u201cthings go wrong\u201d? At best, it\u2019s a frightening game of Russian Roulette, with the highest imaginable stakes.\n\nFor years I have researched the hard facts on the effectiveness of vaccines, and over the past few weeks I organized my binders of information to address three main topics:\n\u2022 How often do things \u201cgo wrong\u201d?\n\u2022 Do we have the right to choose whether or not to use them?\n\nThis blog is my attempt to empower our loved ones, and you, with key insights, perspectives, evidence and resources to go beyond the mis-and-disinformation that is currently dominating the media, guiding most public opinion, and making it difficult for caring people to make informed choices about an issue that matters so much.\n\nI am not going to repeat the mainstream opinion here, because it\u2019s everywhere and is already the source of most people\u2019s worldview on the subject. What\u2019s sorely lacking is comprehensive and open dialogue reflecting opposing viewpoints to encourage our critical thinking. Try to think if you have ever witnessed an in-depth, civil debate amongst informed experts from differing points of view, broadcast to the nation or the world. I have learned to be very suspicious when the banker/corporate interests who control the networks won\u2019t allow dissenting views to be presented. Think Middle East Wars, Federal Reserve, GMOs, Pharmaceuticals\u2026 and Vaccines.\n\nSo I have assembled the evidence and key insights that are not typically shared so that you can make this serious choice from as informed a perspective as possible. I have hyperlinked most major points for those who want to dive deeper into any particular area of this quandary.\n\nSo let\u2019s open our minds and traverse a question-led exploration of many little-known but crucial realities about vaccines.\n\nWhat are vaccines used for?\n\nProponents claim that they are used to prevent such diseases as small pox, polio, swine flu, bird flu, measles, mumps, and rubella. They are envisioned in the future for herpes, e-coli, HIV/AIDS, ebola, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, obesity, high blood pressure, anti-smoking, cocaine and heroin addiction, depression etc.\n\nWhat is in vaccines?\n\nWhat many don\u2019t realize is that in addition to the above mentioned \u201ckilled microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms,\u201d vaccines often also contain preservatives like mercury, thimerosal and MSG along with \u201cadjuvants\u201d (\u201cboosters\u201d) like aluminum. Some suggested \u201cvaccine schedules\u201d encourage us to inject our children with up to 69 doses by the time they are 18. That\u2019s an awful lot for a body to contend with, given that some of these suggested vaccines contain viruses and heavy metals known to cause brain damage. What does evidence show about the safety and effectiveness of these preservatives, additives and boosters? The one study on the health effects of aluminum in babies said a safe limit is 25 mcg. The vaccine schedule delivers 4,925 mcg of aluminum by 18 months.\n\nHere is an informative clip on how ethyl mercury seems to have triggered the Age of Autism.\n\nDo medical experts agree that vaccines are safe and effective?\n\nDr. Bruce Lipton describes his distress about mandatory medical procedures and writes that:\n\nHis article \u201cMandatory Vaccinations Are Bad, & Some Immunizations Are Good\u201d describes his position.\n\nMike Adams, the \u201cHealth Ranger\u201d whose research I will reference later, has written that he is \u201cnot an opponent of the idea of immunization, and I\u2019m not against single-dose vaccines formulated without toxic adjuvants, heavy metals and stealth cancer viruses.\u201d\n\nOthers experts, some from within the agencies manufacturing, regulating and/or disseminating vaccines have risked their reputations to speak out about the risks.\n\nIn the late summer of 2014 a Centers for Disease Control scientist, William Thompson, became a whistleblower. A recorded phone call and an email (to Dr. Julie Gerberding, then of the CDC, now an Executive VP at Merck \u2014 the sole manufacturer of the measles vaccine) laid the foundation for blockbuster revelations about destructive effects of MMR vaccines and thimerosal, particularly in causing an increased risk of autism among African-American boys. Thompson went even further to state that, \u201cThere is biologic plausibility right now to say thimerosal causes autism-like features.\u201d\n\nThe Association of American Physicians and Surgeons wrote to oppose Ohio\u2019s mandate for child vaccination stating that, \u201cChildren younger than 14 are three times more likely to be killed or \u201cseriously injured\u201d by hepatitis B vaccines than to catch the disease.\u201d\n\nBesides the instilled notion that \u201cdoctors know best,\u201d the most common objections to questioning the truth of vaccine safety, efficacy and history seem to be, \u201cWell, at least we know that so many lives were saved by the small pox and polio vaccines, and wasn\u2019t that Wakefield study debunked?\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s look at these.\n\nAndrew Wakefield was a doctor concerned about vaccine safety whose studies showed him there were significant problems with delivering the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines all combined together. He published an article in the Lancet that linked MMR vaccine to bowel disease and autism. This was the last thing that Merck wanted, so the attacks began. He lost his career and his reputation. That tends to be all that most people know about this. They don\u2019t know that his research partner, Prof. John Walker-Smith fought and won an expensive legal battle against the UK\u2019s General Medical Council and was fully exonerated. Wakefield himself has filed a lawsuit against Brian Deer, Fiona Godlee and the British Medical Council for falsely accusing him of fraud \u2014 with the same evidence that cleared Walker-Smith, but that is back page stuff, not warranting the original headlines.\n\nThe Vaccine Autism Cover-up: How One Doctor\u2019s Career was Destroyed for Telling the Truth\n\nDr. Wakefield has consistently invited public, televised debate with those who make allegations against him for his research, and specifically with Dr. David Salsbury, who was instrumental in both the introduction of MMR vaccines and accusations against Dr. Wakefield.\n\nTo my knowledge neither Dr. Salsbury nor any other pro-vaccine \u201cauthority\u201d has been willing to do so. They must be experts in the subject. They know exactly the claims that Dr. Wakefield is making. So why wouldn\u2019t they take the opportunity to set the record straight and educate the public?\n\nThe true epidemic is the epidemic of autism that seems for the most part to be caused by the toxins in these vaccines \u2014 that now has every 1 in 36 in South Korea and 1 in 31 boys in the U.S. as victims of autism.\n\nSpeaking of America, we need to ask ourselves why in the top 34 nations, the U.S. is simultaneously highest in infant mortality and highest in infant vaccination. A chart here will show that in general the higher the vaccination rate, the higher the infant mortality.\n\nDr. Rima Laibow recently presented a paper to the First All India Congress on Medical Education (Feb. 7, 2015, Nitte University, Mangalore, India) in which she looked at the \u201cwidely available and well-substantiated data that makes the case that the only thing that has decreased the incidence of infectious disease is a combination of hygiene, clean water, sufficient protein and other nutrition and sanitation. And that ALL childhood and other infectious diseases, and their associated morbidity and mortality were radically reduced BEFORE the introduction of a single vaccine.\n\nIn every case, the slope of the decrease either remained the same or the decrease slowed down when the vaccines were introduced. In the case of smallpox, when the British government enforced its vaccine mandate, the incidence of death from smallpox increased by nearly 300%.\n\nSeveral experts have come to the same conclusion from their research that the virtual disappearance of POLIO was due not to the Salk and Sabin Vaccines, but to two other factors \u2014 the improvement of hygiene at the time, and especially to the simultaneous \u201credefining\u201d in 1955 of what the category \u201cpolio\u201d was to include.\n\nThe polio death rate was already dramatically declining when the Salk vaccine was introduced. Initially the diagnosis of polio was given if the patient\u2019s paralysis lasted 24 hours. Later the parameters were changed to the person\u2019s paralysis lasting 60 days. By redefining the definition of the disease, the decrease appeared to be associated with the vaccine, but most likely was not.\n\nThe mainstream media will not speak openly about the SV-40 cancer virus that was spread to millions of people worldwide after being given as part of the polio vaccine. But it will try to promote a \u201cglobal polio pandemic\u201d that turns out to have no substance.\n\nDr. Suzanne Humphries, author of , makes the important point that \u201cYou cannot dabble in the topic of vaccination.\u201d With stakes as high as these, being informed is the least you can do.\n\nDr. Humphries goes on to recount the history of misunderstanding behind the myths around the smallpox and polio vaccines. Here is a video where she is interviewed by Dr. Joseph Mercola.\n\nDr. Peter Rost, MD is a former vice president of Pfizer who has become a whistleblower of the entire pharmaceutical industry. He is also the author of \u201cThe Whistleblower, Confessions of a Healthcare Hitman.\u201d Here is a clip of Dr. Rost from the film \u201cOne More Girl\u201d about the dangers of Gardasil.\n\nA UK doctor with an autistic son wanted information on what the CDC knows about vaccine dangers, so he filed a FOIA request. Almost 7 years later a judge finally ordered the agency to turn over the documents. This information shows 30 years of coverup. It obviously won\u2019t end the vaccine debate, but this article helps shine a light on the arbitrariness of the vaccine \u201cschedule\u201d and puts the deception in context with the 2009 H1N1 (Swine Flu) cover-up that so embarrassed the CDC and other similar events.\n\nHere are two articles that further chronicle a legacy of fraud at Merck, the FDA and the CDC.\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. got involved in this issue when he was given a transcript of a secret meeting of 75 leaders in the pharmaceutical industry. In the meeting the head of the FDA and the Director of Johns Hopkins said they had to \u201ccome clean.\u201d They were referring to the dramatic rise in autism from 1 in 1,000 in 1987, when the \u201cgateway of vaccines\u201d was begun, to 1 in 68 within two years. Similar rises in ADD, ADHD, asthma and food allergies were also occurring. 500 studies showed thimerosal caused autism in animals and 39 showed the same for humans.\n\nInstead of coming clean, new studies were \u201ccreated\u201d to cover up and continue and the lobbying pharmaceutical companies used their political power to create the \u201cvaccine court\u201d to take the drug corporations off the hook and get the taxpayers to cover the damages. Here is a riveting clip of Kennedy talking about all of this.\n\nActor Jim Carrey has done some serious homework on vaccines and has had the courage to leverage his popularity and take flak for standing up to protect children with knowledge. This article gives a succinct summary of his key points about sidestepping the Nuremberg codes on informed consent, the vast lobbying fees it takes to keep people uninformed and the increasing legacy of first hand whistleblowers. Rebuttals to his arguments from the mainstream came mostly in the form of personal attacks and dramatic headlines telling him to shut up, not from presentation of facts, evidence or logic.\n\nIf vaccines are safe, why are pharmaceutical companies given blanket immunity from prosecution for damages that they cause?\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to pay for the care of just some of those damaged by vaccinations \u2014 but only by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that was created to put the burden of ruining victim\u2019s lives onto the taxpayer. A couple of examples are that over 800 children across Europe suffered severe brain damage from the Swine Flu vaccine and the UK government agreed to pay $90 million in compensation as part of a vaccine injury settlement.\n\nDr. Rima Laibow wrote a detailed response to Australian journalist Claire Harvey\u2019s claim in the Daily Telegraph that those who oppose forced vaccinations are \u201cbaby killers.\u201d Here is a list of what Dr. Laibow calls \u201ccold, hard facts\u201d that refute many of the myths used to persuade people to take the injections for themselves and their kids:\n\nDr. Russell Blaylock describes in detail how the adjuvants in some vaccines apparently can lead to Depression and Neurodegeneration after Age 50.\n\nThe American woman who was the first to die of measles in 12 years turned out to have been already vaccinated against measles!\n\nIf you want to know the truth and have the stomach for graphic images showing the tragic evidence of some of the damage vaccines can do to children, look here.\n\nThere is also a study in May of 2015 that was published in PEDIATRICS, describing the ineffectiveness of the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine. From the Abstract: \u201cLack of long-term protection after vaccination is likely contributing to increases in pertussis among adolescents.\u201d\n\nHere are more accounts of this vaccine \u201cfail\u201d from Nevada and Texas.\n\nAs Dr. Suzanne Humphries explains, the notion that children who are not vaccinated will infect those who are flies in the face of logic and science. If the vaccines work, then being exposed should not be a problem, right? And if they are not effective guarding against exposure to the disease, then what exactly are they good for?\n\nUnfortunately, there is actually no solid evidence that vaccines are effective, or that they are safe. In fact, evidence reveals that they often spread the very disease they are supposed to eliminate, as well as even cause others. I know this is not what we have been taught by doctors and the media.\n\nCan we trust the medical establishment\u2019s endorsement?\n\nBut then, what else has the medical establishment endorsed that turned out to be harmful? Thalidomide, tobacco, DDT\u2026 Of course allopathic medicine can be immensely useful. It has its many areas where it is supremely effective in repairing, replacing, muting pain and so forth, but that does not mean anyone should blindly follow all their dictates.\n\nI know there are countless doctors, nurses, bio-chemists and even pharmaceutical managers and sales reps who believe they are acting in good faith and for the benefit of others in developing, promoting and injecting vaccines. As we said in THRIVE, most people implementing the harmful policies are not aware of the bigger agenda of which they are a part. But to know this, one has to invest the time and open-minded discernment necessary to wade through the propaganda and find sources of reliable information.\n\nThe extent of NSA surveillance was laughed off as a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d until Edward Snowden could prove it. Similarly here is a revelation from a CDC whistleblower who came forward to admit that the organization was planning on trying to conceal RFID chips (as mentioned in THRIVE) in one-use syringes for delivering their planned Ebola vaccine.\n\nIs it risky for doctors who seriously question the safety or effectiveness of vaccines to speak out?\n\nOf course, this type of dissent is dangerous to engage in \u2014 for your career, for your reputation and for your personal safety.\n\nDr. Sherri Tenpenny, a \u201cpro-informed consent\u201d osteopath, had to cancel a vaccine education tour of 11 seminars throughout her own country of Australia when she faced so many threats of violence from those who felt that their dogmatic beliefs entitled them to force toxic chemicals on others.\n\nDr. Jeff Bradstreet, one of the key doctors linking vaccines to autism, was found dead recently \u2014 floating in a North Carolina river with a bullet hole in his chest.\n\nBut there are nevertheless many brave individuals who are informed enough to be concerned and true to their oath (\u201cdo no harm\u201d) that they are willing to speak up. Here is an article and e-book addressing the topic, \u201cMedical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations \u2014 Should Their Views be Silenced?\u201d\n\nWould the AMA, CDC, NCIP and the pharmaceutical companies ACTUALLY withhold critical information about health risks intentionally?\n\nA article from March of 2015 contains quotes glowing about how the new synthetic vaccines can take over the patient\u2019s DNA:\n\nSo vaccinations can change your DNA and remake your biology\u2026 Don\u2019t you think people should be told about that? And what about them wanting to make this mandatory, as the authorities tried to so with the Swine Flu and the mandatory vaccine bill passed in California \u2014 SB 277 etc.)\n\nIn 2014 the health committee of Kenya\u2019s National Assembly ordered an independent inquiry into the Catholic Church\u2019s concern that a national anti-tetanus vaccination campaign was a cover for a sterilization scheme covertly intended to suppress the country\u2019s population growth. The program was for female Kenyans aged 14\u201319.\n\nThe government\u2019s Health Ministry submitted its test results that showed NO trace of HCG \u2014 the miscarriage-causing hormone suspected to have been included. So the Catholic bishops did their own tests \u2014 ALL of which showed significant traces of HCG!\n\nRemember, as mentioned in THRIVE, the World Health Organization was already busted for secretly using similar sterilants on women in Mexico in 1993 and Philippines in 1994. (You can review this from timecode 1:33:50\u20131:37:57 in THRIVE.)\n\nApparently having brown skin can make it particularly dangerous to put your trust and health in the hands of Government and Globalist institutions. This is reminiscent of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment when 339 rural African-American men in Alabama were told by the Public Health Service that they were being given free health care when they were actually being given injected syphilis. Most died from the disease and many of their wives and 19 children were born with it.\n\nIn a primarily Gates Foundation funded initiative in India, 16,000 young women in Andhra Pradesh were given the Gardasil vaccine, and another 14,000 in Vadodara, supposedly to prevent cervical cancer. Consent forms to participate in this program were \u201cillegally\u201d signed by wardens from youth hostels. Many of the girls have reported epileptic seizures, severe stomach cramps, headaches. Some died and many have experienced infertility.\n\nIn the UK, \u201cTens of thousands of teenage girls have fallen seriously ill and even been left wheelchair-bound after taking the cervical cancer vaccination.\u201d\n\nDr. Kelly Brogan has gathered and cohered critical information about \u201cthe New Gardasil \u2014 the fear they are selling, natural alternatives and the ethical issues involved.\u201d Especially because the \u201cgovernment\u201d of California is claiming the right to make Gardasil injections MANDATORY, this is critical data to consider.\n\nBrace yourself and look at this clip of a teenage girl incapacitated in whole-body pain since her Gardasil shot. Your momentary discomfort in watching it could help others not have to experience this kind of chronic suffering.\n\nAnother WHO / Gates project in Chad (Africa) rendered 50 youths paralyzed from a new Meningitis vaccine. The Gates Foundation is also being sued for its polio vaccine program causing 47,500 paralysis deaths. This is the man who is dedicated to vaccinating every single child on the planet and who invested in the \u201cDoomsday\u201d Organic Seed vault in Svalbaard, Norway, along with Monsanto and the Rockefeller Foundation, while at the same time pushing GMO seeds by Monsanto (in which he is heavily invested) on India and Africa.\n\nAt least we have the right to choose, right?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer is moving toward \u201cno.\u201d\n\nIf someone chooses to have themselves or their child vaccinated after being fully informed, then that is their choice. But for those who choose not to, the fundamental violation that mandating (forcing) vaccinations represents is the most dangerous threat.\n\nIf we concede to these corporate interests taking control of our bodies with DNA-altering injections, we are forfeiting our right to own our own bodies and to protect our children. The notion that someone can legally and forcefully inject us and our children with microorganisms and toxins against our will is the limit: if we don\u2019t actually own our own bodies, or our right to protect our children as we see fit, then what rights do we have?\n\nThe jackboot of medical tyranny is being raised over our own and our children\u2019s heads. Governor Brown of California has already signed SB 277 into law, meaning in 2016 children won\u2019t have the right to attend public or private schools or many day-care facilities without submitting to multiple vaccines. And that is just the beginning.\n\nOne of the vaccines required under California\u2019s SB 277 is Hepatitis B. Currently students who actually already HAVE Hep B are allowed to attend school, but if you haven\u2019t had the vaccination against it you will be denied access to the schools which, in most cases, you are already paying for with your taxes. What?\n\n\u201cAccording to health experts, the presence of a person with hepatitis B or C poses no significant risk to others in school, daycare or school athletic settings as long as all teachers, staff and coaches are properly trained in first aid and standard precautions.\u201d So why would kids need to be vaccinated for Hep B to attend school?\n\nClearly this whole issue has not been the subject of much critical thinking.\n\nAs SB 277, the mandatory vaccination law in California, was being debated in the legislature, Senator Richard Pan, a physician, was the top recipient of a share of more than $2 million in campaign contributions by large pharmaceutical companies. He also received donations from Merck in 2010 ahead of supporting a 2011 law allowing girls as young as 12 years old to receive Gardasil vaccinations without parental consent.\n\nVaccines are the only product government mandates and completely indemnifies.\n\nIt reminds me of the nuclear industry, which is so dangerous that insurance companies refuse to insure it, so it is subsidized by the government.\n\nThe \u201cState\u201d wants to have the right to control your body and arrest you if you resist. Allowing mandatory vaccination now will only grow the government, justifying extensive government monitoring, new surveillance powers, reporting obligations by home-schooling parents and the further forcing of ordinary people to pay more to influential corporations.\n\nFirst They Came for the Anti-Vaxxers\n\nHas anyone \u201cfollowed the money\u201d to look at what\u2019s behind the push for more and more vaccination?\n\nI recommend that you print out and spend some time with this graphic by Mike Adams to understand the revolving doors and complimentary motives that could lead to ignoring and even hiding the destruction of human lives to serve profit and control.\n\nWhether you believe vaccines are all great or they are dangerous and result from greed, incompetence or a more nefarious agenda, clearly there is huge evidence that this game of Russian Roulette is a risky one, and you and your children are the ones bearing the brunt of this risk. And clearly the facts demonstrate that in every major sector, banking, media, medicine, etc., the same people are profiting and gaining control. My conclusions are the result of decades of investigation and research. I understand that not everyone can accept the extent of what I believe is happening. As I said in THRIVE, I may be wrong. But what if I\u2019m not?\n\nFollowing is the conclusion of an article \u2014 \u2014 that helps follow the money and motives that transcend mere incompetence and greed.\n\nI. G. Farben partnered with the Rockefellers (proven architects of eugenics and depopulation activities as laid out in THRIVE) to create a chemical and pharmaceutical cartel complex in Germany that remained politically protected from allied bombings during WWII to become the CIA\u2019s headquarters following the war. They produced pesticides, drugs and war gases including Zyklon B \u2014 used for genocide in the concentration camps in Germany.\n\n\u201cThe Merck Corporation became a primary recipient of Nazi \u2018flight capital\u2019 at the time their company\u2019s president, George W. Merck, was America\u2019s biological weapons industry director. The flight capital scheme assured the rise of a Nazi \u2018Fourth Reich.\u2019 (Also see The Rise of the Fourth Reich , Jim Marrs.) It was alternatively called the \u2018Neuordnung\u2019 \u2014 New Order \u2014 for the global chemical-pharmaceutical and banking cartels.\u201d ( , Leonard G. Horowitz)\n\nIf there were an actual nefarious agenda behind the vaccine controversy, we might expect high level \u201cbought\u201d politicians to get on board with mass injection\u2026\n\nHillary Clinton has recently tweeted \u201cThe science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and vaccines work. Let\u2019s protect all our kids.\u201d \u2014 In other words, \u201cDon\u2019t question this, let\u2019s inject every child.\u201d\n\nIn February, 2015, Barack Obama came out urging all parents to get their kids vaccinated. \u201cThere aren\u2019t reasons not to,\u201d he said.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld was a former Chairman of the board and major investor in Gilead Sciences, the company that created \u201cTamiflu,\u201d the drug the government tried to push for the never-materialized Bird Flu \u201cEpidemic.\u201d Former Secretary of State George Schultz also sat on that board. Both made millions from that \u201cscare.\u201d\n\nWould so-called \u201cleaders\u201d use drugs to manipulate the \u201ccommon folk?\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense has already planned for and tested dropping aerial vaccines on entire populations.\n\nAerosolized thought control vaccines already have already been tested on humans.\n\nIf you think that this push to inject people with these substances won\u2019t affect you, consider that there used to be religious and philosophical as well as medical exemptions. Now, starting with SB 277 in California, there will be only very rare and hard to get medical ones. If you think the controllers won\u2019t eventually come for your home-schooled kids, for the private day-care centers, remember history shows this tyrannical violation doesn\u2019t stop unless courageous people insist on stopping it.\n\nAnother bill, SB 792, is now gathering momentum in the California legislature. It would prohibit any employees at daycare centers who were not fully immunized according to the state\u2019s official \u201cschedule.\u201d Being an adult won\u2019t protect you. Being informed and effective in your actions might.\n\nYou can contact your Assembly Member to urge a no vote.\n\nHere are some helpful websites working for freedom from vaccine tyranny:\n\nWhat Can We Do to Guard our Freedom and Health?\n\nStrike and demonstrate at your place of school or work if threatened with mandatory vaccinations.\n\nHold a Vaccine Education night at or near your children\u2019s schools inviting all perspectives for a respectful discussion.\n\nCreate petitions to your boards of education, city councils, school principals, medical clinics, political representatives.\n\nFile court complaints against offending organizations and individuals. Here is a sample for Swine Flu.\n\nEducate brave lawyers who can help file individual lawsuits against Governor Jerry Brown and individual members of the California state legislature.\n\nMobilize to hold politicians and CDC, FDA, Big Pharma Execs accountable on the basis of PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES.\n\nPrint out copies of a Vaccine Liability Acceptance Form or a \u201cWarranty of Vaccine Safety\u201d Here is a sample. Will doctors ever sign them? Not likely, but it makes your stand \u2014 and theirs \u2014 very clear for the record.\n\nMany advise not signing a Refusal to Vaccinate form because it was created by the CDC legal department and is set up against the patient. Read more here.\n\nIf you choose not to accept vaccines, get an Advance Vaccination Directive Card and carry it with you.\n\nOrganize coherent activism by Sectors \u2014 Health, Science, Justice, Media, etc. And make sure that a team follows the money! Check out these Solutions videos for how this method worked to stop a Presidential level toxic spray program in Northern California.\n\nPress for the removal of all toxic chemicals from any vaccines, the restoration of choice for every individual, and full liability for manufacturers.\n\nHere is an example of an informed letter to Australian PM Tony Abbott about the MMR vaccine.\n\nEncourage people to enhance their own natural immunity through healthy lifestyle, plenty of vitamin D and immune boosting fruits and vegetables and reducing exposure to immuno-suppressing toxins such as pesticides and food additives.\n\nUse your talents, skills and networks to awaken as many as possible \u2014 especially in the military and law enforcement \u2014 to the risks of vaccines and our inalienable right not to be violated against our will.\n\nWill mandatory vaccines, gun confiscation or more economic theft light the blaze of revolution to restore our inalienable rights? Or can we use our minds to connect all of these dots, realize the risk and take non-violent action before it\u2019s too late? Thrive Movement is dedicated to the latter path.\n\nThis information is my offering to the vast majority of people who just want to do their best to take care of themselves, their loved ones and humanity, and do no harm.
