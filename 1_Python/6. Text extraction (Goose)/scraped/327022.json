(Related: Vaccine mandate in Ecuador province defeated by health freedom organization.)\n\nAccording to the newly elected leader, the country\u2019s vaccine mandate put in place before he assumed power was \u201ccontrary to international standards.\u201d To back up his claim, he cited an April 2021 statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) that denounced vaccine mandates.\n\nThe April 13 WHO statement said compulsory vaccination policies \u201cinterfere with freedom and individual autonomy\u201d and called for policymakers to \u201cbalance the well-being of the community with individual liberties.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Mandatory vaccination\u2019 policies limit individual choice in non-trivial ways by making vaccination a condition of, for example, attending school or working in particular industries or settings like health care.\u201d\n\nFormer Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado Quesada announced nationwide vaccine mandates back in 2021, first with public-sector employees having an Oct. 15 deadline to get vaccinated. The mandate was subsequently expanded, with proof of vaccination becoming mandatory to join certain activities and enter many establishments in the country beginning Dec. 1.\n\n\u201cWe have to give time for the people who remain to get their two vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cAs of Dec. 1, there will be no excuse.\u201d\n\nAlvarado later touted this achievement during his final speech in May 2022. He claimed that Costa Rica was among \u201ca select group of countries in the world that has more than 85 percent of its population vaccinated with at least one dose.\u201d\n\nChaves: Vaccine mandates in Costa Rica \u201cinvalid\u201d as policymakers\u2019 terms already expired\n\nChaves further slammed his predecessor\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines as violation of Costa Rican law.\n\nHe pointed out that the members of the Central American nation\u2019s National Vaccination and Epidemiology Commission (CNVE) were functioning under expired terms. When Chaves and his new administration took office, they realized that the commissioners\u2019 terms \u201cofficially ended in 2020.\u201d This, he added, officially rendered all of their actions after their term expired \u2013 including mandating the COVID-19 vaccine \u2013 invalid.\n\n\u201cWhen told this, [the CNVE members] all got quiet. They said nobody had told them their terms had ended, and nobody questioned this until the minister here investigated,\u201d the president continued, pointing to Health Minister Jocelyn Chacon Madrigal.\n\nAccording to Chaves, he asked Chacon to suspend the vaccine mandates \u201cgiven the illegal actions taken by the CNVE.\u201d He clarified, however, that the country kept doses of the COVID-19 vaccine \u201cavailable for those who, in the exercise of their liberty, desire to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nChacon, who was also present during Chaves\u2019 Aug. 3 press conference, shot down accusations that the new administration is \u201canti-vaccination.\u201d She added that members of new cabinet were \u201cup to date\u201d with their vaccination.\n\n\u201cThere are countries which do not mandate, and have higher rates of vaccination. Why? Because people do not want to be ordered. They prefer to have things explained,\u201d remarked Chacon.\n\nWatch InfoWars founder Alex Jones explain why U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate is illegal.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nNYC ends vaccine mandate for retail customers \u2013 but not for employees.\n\nHochul drops covid vaccine mandate for MTA after workers quit in protest.\n\nOut of the blue, Washington, D.C., suddenly drops covid \u201cvaccine\u201d mandate.", "opengraph": {"title": "Costa Rican president scraps COVID vaccine mandate, says forcing the clot shot on people \u201cagainst the law\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2022-08-09-costa-rican-president-scraps-covid-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "The president of the Central American nation of Costa Rica scrapped the country\u2019s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate, noting\u00a0that forcing the shot on Costa Ricans was \u201cagainst the law.\u201d \u201cAs of today, the vaccines are not mandatory\u00a0\u2013 and therefore, any action taken against anyone who does not want to be vaccinated is an action that [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.vaccines.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2022/08/Covid-19-Coronavirus-Vaccine-Bulk-Vials.jpg"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "big government", "Costa Rica", "covid-19", "Liberty", "medical fascism", "vaccine wars", "vaccine", "Rodrigo Chaves Robles", "progress", "vaccine mandates", "Medical Tyranny", "awakening", "freedom", "health freedom", "medical martial law", "Jocelyn Chacon Madrigal"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/our-people-are-not-cattle-president-of-costa-rica-abolishes-covid-vaccine-mandate/", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-28-vaccine-mandate-ecuador-defeated-health-freedom-organization.html", "https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/340841/WHO-2019-nCoV-Policy-brief-Mandatory-vaccination-2021.1-eng.pdf", "https://ticotimes.net/2021/10/13/costa-ricas-coronavirus-measures-vaccine-mandates-for-october-2021-updated", "https://healthfreedom.news", "https://www.brighteon.com/07c13854-f13e-4945-b670-6c20731d3ec8", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/infowarsnetwork", "https://healthfreedom.news/2022-06-27-austrian-government-drops-covid-vaccine-mandate.html", "https://healthfreedom.news/2022-06-27-austrian-government-drops-covid-vaccine-mandate.html", "https://vaccines.news/2022-03-02-nyc-ends-indoor-vaccine-mandate-for-customers.html", "https://healthfreedom.news/2022-01-03-hochul-drops-covid-vaccine-mandate-mta-protest.html", "https://pandemic.news/2022-02-14-washington-dc-suddenly-drops-covid-vaccine-mandate.html", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/our-people-are-not-cattle-president-of-costa-rica-abolishes-covid-vaccine-mandate/", "https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/340841/WHO-2019-nCoV-Policy-brief-Mandatory-vaccination-2021.1-eng.pdf", "https://ticotimes.net/2021/10/13/costa-ricas-coronavirus-measures-vaccine-mandates-for-october-2021-updated", "https://www.brighteon.com/07c13854-f13e-4945-b670-6c20731d3ec8", "//www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.vaccines.news/2022-08-09-costa-rican-president-scraps-covid-vaccine-mandate.html&linkname=Costa%20Rican%20president%20scraps%20COVID%20vaccine%20mandate%2C%20says%20forcing%20the%20clot%20shot%20on%20people%20%E2%80%9Cagainst%20the%20law%E2%80%9D", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
