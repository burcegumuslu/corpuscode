Most \u2018mainstream\u2019 outlets no longer see their role as informing the public so we can make up our own minds about issues.\n\nRather, they now see their primary objective as working on behalf of tyrannical leaders within the deep state and political establishment. Our media, and the media in many Western-aligned countries, now see their role as primarily pushing the \u2018state\u2019 narrative; they are propagandists, not informers.\n\nAnd with the rise of Big Tech, the flow of information to the people is now so tightly controlled, a recent study found that failing to report scandal and corruption linked to one presidential contender, Joe Biden, very likely led to his \u2018winning\u2019 the election.\n\nRather, they now see their primary objective as working on behalf of tyrannical leaders within the deep state and political establishment.
