To reduce emissions at any cost, both he and President Biden are oblivious to the fact that breezes and sunshine can only generate electricity.\n\nBoth are unaware of the reality that the products manufactured from fossil fuels were the primary reasons the world populated from one to eight billion in less than 200 years. The major unintended consequence of divesting in crude oil is that efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change. Today, wind turbines and solar panels cannot manufacture anything for society.\n\nCalifornia Governor Newsom and President Biden are so focused on emission reductions, they have lost touch with the negative impact on the world\u2019s population without fossil fuels, and the shortages and inflation inflicted upon all.\n\nToday, in less than 200 years, the world has more than 6,000 products that are made with oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, as well as numerous infrastructures and a space program that did not exist a few centuries ago.\n\nBoth are deaf to the reality that wind turbines, solar panels, and EV vehicles are all made from oil derivatives manufactured from the same crude oil that they want to rid the world of.\n\nDespite the reality of all the good fossil fuels have done for humanity, both wish to rid the world of fossil fuels and return to the decarbonized society that existed a few hundred years ago.\n\nMost importantly, those fossil fuel products are needed today to support the growing demands of the world\u2019s economy and to maintain for the health and well-being of the world\u2019s eight billion residents. Both believe we can live WITHOUT these manufactured products for society:\n\nRenewables cannot manufacture fuels for the:\n\u2022 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.\n\u2022 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.\n\u2022 The 290 million registered vehicles in the U.S. as of 2021, that were comprised of about 56 percent trucks, 40 percent cars, and 4 percent motorcycles.\n\u2022 The cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world.\n\nRenewables cannot manufacture oil derivatives to make thousands of products such as:\n\u2022 Tires for the billions of vehicles.\n\u2022 Asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways.\n\u2022 Fertilizers that come from natural gas to help feed billions.\n\u2022 Pesticides to control locusts and other pests.\n\u2022 Wind turbines and solar panels as they are all made with products from fossil fuels\n\nNeither has a substitute for oil, thus their focus is to rid America of oil production and be dependent on importing oil from foreign countries that have less environmental controls and lower humanity standards. Governor Newsom is proud that California is the only state in contiguous America that imports MOST of its demands for oil from foreign counties via air polluting tankers traversing around the world.\n\nBoth support subsidies for wind and solar which provides financing for the environmental degradation and humanity atrocities occurring in the developing countries with yellow, brown, and black skinned residents mining for the exotic minerals and metals to support the green movement.\n\nObviously neither Newsom nor Biden have read the 2022 Pulitzer Prize nominated book Clean Energy Exploitations \u2013 Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy\u201d, before they speak again about the environment.\n\nRestricting the supply of oil feedstock to be manufactured by refineries into usable products for society is not helpful in meeting the growing demands by society. Further, both are oblivious to one in five oil refineries that are expected to cease operations over the next five years which may be 20 percent of the 135 refineries in America, while Asia is building over 80 new refineries to provide America and the world, with the products being demanded by society.\n\nCrude oil is useless unless it can be manufactured into something usable. Today\u2019s are all the rage to divest in all fossil fuels. ESG is working but will result in shortages and inflation as the new norm as society\u2019s demands for the products from crude oil are exceeding the supply from the diminishing number of manufacturers.\n\nRidding the world of oil, without a replacement in mind, is immoral and evil, as extreme shortages will result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths, necessitating lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800\u2019s and could be the greatest threat to the planet\u2019s eight billion residents.\n\nLife without oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine and NEITHER wind turbines, nor solar panels, can manufacture direct energy for society. Climate change may impact humanity but being mandated to live without the products manufactured from oil, will\n\nIn addition, Newsom\u2019s track record in California may be dark clouds over his desire to seek the Presidency. To Newsom, closing schools, more crime, high taxes and eating at the French Laundry\u2014for him, not you\u2014are freedom, promoting the highest cost for electricity and fuels in the country, in his state which is now less than fifty percent white. \u201cOver half the nation\u2019s homeless crowd the state\u2019s major cities. One-third of America\u2019s welfare recipients have flooded into the state. A fifth of the resident population lives below the poverty line. California public school test scores consistently fall among the bottom 10 states. San Francisco has the highest per capita property crime rate in the country. Newsom wants the rest of the country to clone California\u2019s over regulations that inflict inflation and shortages in perpetuity.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Newsom is like Biden", "description": "California Governor Newsom is pondering a run at the Presidency.
