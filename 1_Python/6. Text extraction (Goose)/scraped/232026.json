That flies in the face of reality.\n\nNeatly nestled behind the Ukraine headlines plastered all over the front pages, this past week has seen the World Health Organization meeting to discuss the global legislation to empowering the WHO to combat \u201cfuture pandemics\u201d.\n\nThe first consultation was held on March 1st. The EU passed a motion authorizing the bloc to negotiate such a treaty on March 3rd.\n\nNobody knows exactly what the hypothetical international regulations \u2013 dubbed the \u201cPandemic Treaty\u201d \u2013 would entail, but there are hints.\n\nIt\u2019s almost certainly going to involve some kind of international vaccine passport, possible based on the SMART Health Cards currently rolling out all across the US.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that this treaty is being developed in parallel to the UK \u201creforming\u201d their Human Rights Act 1998 into a new \u201cUK bill of rights\u201d which seeks to prevent the \u201cabuse\u201d of \u201crights culture\u201d and place a new emphasis on \u201csocial responsibility\u201d.\n\nHowever, the specifics will remain a mystery until the final proposal is published later this year.\n\nOne thing we do know though, is that a big part of the proposed \u201cstrengthening\u201d of our pandemic response will be increased funding and resources for developing vaccines even faster than the Covid vaccine.\n\nThis aim was announced at the recent Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit in London, where the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced their \u201c100 Days Mission\u201d.\n\nCEPI, for those who don\u2019t know, is a foundation jointly funded by (among others) the Bill and Melinda Gate Foundation and the World Economic Forum, whose stated aim is \u201cto develop vaccines to stop future epidemics\u201d.\n\nThe 100 Days Mission, which already has its own website and a trending hashtag (#100DaysMission), is pretty much exactly what it sounds like.\n\nIn future CEPI wants to produce new vaccines for unknown emerging diseases \u2013 what they call Disease X \u2013 within 100 days of the pathogen being isolated.\n\nThey\u2019ve already secured 1.5 BILLION pounds sterling to further this effort.\n\nOver a billion pounds to produce vaccines for a disease that \u2013 as yet \u2013 does not even exist, and may never exist.\n\nThis looks like a further step in the process, begun by the \u2018pandemic\u2019 narrative, of redefining everything we previously understood about how infective agents and vaccines interact.\n\nCovid, let\u2019s remember, was a disease-narrative totally removed from all social, scientific and historical context to create a fluid, agenda-driven alternate reality. And it looks as if this is intended to be the \u2018new normal\u2019.\n\nHere\u2019s a little refresher course on just how fast the Covid vaccines sped through the usual scientific process:\n\u2022 The virus was allegedly discovered in December.\n\u2022 It was fully genetically sequenced by January 10th 2020.\n\u2022 The paper that all the PCR tests were based on was peer-reviewed in less than 24 hours.\n\u2022 After decades of failure, the human race produced a dozen effective coronavirus vaccines in less than three months.\n\u2022 These vaccines were then \u201csafety tested\u201d in less than six months.\n\nAll told, from \u2018discovering\u2019 the virus to getting the vaccine(s) approved for use on people, it took 300 days.\n\nThis process normally takes at least 3-10 years.\n\nIt usually takes at least 5-10 years to bring a fully-tested vaccine to market. A paper by Pronker et al, \u201cRisk in vaccine research and development quantified\u201d (PubMed 2013), estimates the average development time for a new vaccine to be over 10 years.\n\nSimply put, it has never been possible to make a vaccine for a new disease in 1000 days, let alone 100.\n\nThe speed with which the covid vacines were produced is totally unprecedented in the history of vaccines.\n\nThe idea you could further reduce this unprecedented time frame, and produce a safe and effective vaccine in only 100 days is frankly absurd. It\u2019s surreal. Fictional.\n\nFor one thing, the vast majority of candidate vaccines don\u2019t work.\n\nThe Pronker paper, found that of all potential vaccines products being researched, only about 6% ever actually hit the market.\n\nSo, back in the real world, a vaccine manufacturer will go through that 5-10 year process knowing there is a ~94% chance there will be nothing to show for it in the end.\n\nAfter decades of trying they haven\u2019t managed to produce a vaccine against AIDs, or the flu, or malaria or many other common diseases. These are conditions they know and (allegedly) understand, but they cannot make vaccines for them.\n\nSo, in that old world of veridical reality, even if you managed to make a vaccine in 100 days, the odds are it either won\u2019t produce immunity, or it will but will also produce harmful side effects, or maybe it will do literally nothing.\n\nNow, granted, science and technology are not static. We are always moving forward and making progress\u2026but that\u2019s irrelevant to this issue, because even if vaccine manufacturing technology really did take a huge leap forward just in time to battle covid, you still can\u2019t produce a safe vaccine in 100 days, or even 300 days \u2013 because the process NEEDS time.\n\nIt takes time to test rigorously, it takes time \u2013 a lot of it \u2013 to a assess long term side effects. The clue is right there in the name.\n\nNo amount of new tech is going to permit you to know the ten-year effects of a vaccine in under three months.\n\nWith the public eye fixed on Ukraine, and Covid now firmly in the collective unconsciousness\u2019s rearview mirror the powers that be are trying to normalise what was, inherently, an abnormal, unreal (if not impossible) process. To make it easier \u201cnext time\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen Bill Gates lament that the vaccine was too slow, and he was partially right. The Covid story didn\u2019t keep people hypnotized enough to secure everything they needed, in part because their \u201cvaccine\u201d rollout took almost a year.\n\nBut for the future \u201cDisease X\u201d waiting in the wings, it will officially only take three months, and the fear will still be fresh. The fact the process will be completely incompatible with reality or sense will not matter in the slightest.\n\nTo be clear: You cannot develop a \u201csafe and effective\u201d vaccine for a brand new disease in three months.\n\nYou can\u2019t do it in one year.\n\nAnd if in the future they claim to have done so, they will be lying.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Reality Check: \u201c100 day vaccines\u201d are NOT possible.", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/03/11/reality-check-100-day-vaccines-are-not-possible/", "description": "Kit Knightly Neatly nestled behind the Ukraine headlines plastered all over the front pages, this past week has seen the World Health Organization meeting to discuss the global legislation to empow\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-03-11T13:00:58+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-11T17:46:06+00:00", "site_name": "OffGuardian", "image": "https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/100-days-mission-covid.jpg", "image:width": "2050", "image:height": "950", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["flu", "CEPI", "Bill Gates", "coronavirus", "WHO"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/100-days-mission-covid.jpg", "https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/pandemic-treaty/", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/02/26/who-planning-new-pandemic-treaty-for-2024/", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/03/01/who-moving-foward-on-global-vaccine-passport-program/", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/02/08/uk-reforming-human-rights-law-compulsory-vaccines-on-the-horizon/", "https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/minister-milling-speech-at-the-cepi-global-pandemic-preparedness-summit-2022", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_Epidemic_Preparedness_Innovations", "https://100days.cepi.net/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysMission?src=hashtag_click", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_X", "https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/01/china-releases-genetic-data-new-coronavirus-now-deadly", "https://off-guardian.org/2021/09/22/30-facts-you-need-to-know-your-covid-cribsheet/", "https://news.sky.com/story/world-must-roll-out-jab-for-next-pandemic-virus-in-just-100-days-scientist-behind-oxford-covid-vaccine-says-12560169", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23526951/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23526951/", "https://twitter.com/backtolife_2022/status/1494820172389040128", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/02/20/this-week-in-the-new-normal-23/", "https://ko-fi.com/offguardian", "https://www.subscribestar.com/offguardian", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bitcoin", "https://liberapay.com/OffGuardian/donate", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bank", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-03-11T13:00:58+00:00"}
