Pfizer Booster Shot Sent His Cancer Into Overdrive\n\nAfter realizing his COVID-19 booster shot may have sent his cancer into overdrive, Michel Goldman, M.D., Ph.D., professor of immunology and pharmacotherapy at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, said going public with the information was the \u201cright thing to do.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published by The Defender \u2013 Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s News & Views Website\n\nMichel Goldman, M.D., Ph.D., professor of immunology and pharmacotherapy at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, suspects his third dose of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine may have sent his cancer into overdrive.\n\nGoldman, 67, is one of Europe\u2019s best-known champions of medical research and a lifelong promoter of vaccines.\n\nBut he told The Atlantic he wants discussion of the COVID-19 vaccine to be transparent \u2014 so he went public about his suspicion that the Pfizer booster shot he received on Sept. 22, 2021, may have induced rapid progression of his angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), a type of lymphoma he\u2019d been diagnosed with before he got the booster shot.\n\nAfter his diagnosis, Goldman said he rushed to get the booster shot, believing he would need it more than most people because once he started chemotherapy, his immune system would be compromised.\n\nBut after receiving the shot, Goldman\u2019s follow-up CT scan showed something unexpected: Within only a few days, his cancer had grown so fast that cancerous points were lighting up all over his scan.\n\n\u201cIt looked like someone had set off fireworks inside Michel\u2019s body,\u201d The Atlantic reported.\n\nGoldman and his brother, Serge Goldman, a fellow scientist and head of nuclear medicine at the teaching hospital of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, suspected Goldman\u2019s COVID-19 booster shot may have triggered the rapid proliferation of cancerous growth in his body.\n\nThe initial CT scan had been \u201ca bit disturbing,\u201d Serge Goldman told The Atlantic, because it showed an asymmetrical cluster of cancerous nodes around Goldman\u2019s left armpit, where Michel\u2019s first two doses of vaccine had been delivered.\n\nThe CT scan done after Michel\u2019s third dose showed the cancer\u2019s asymmetry had flipped and was clustered by his right armpit, where he received the third shot.\n\nThe brothers knew it could be a mere coincidence, but they thought it was important to investigate the possibility that the vaccine might be behind the clustering \u2014 because it could mean other people with certain forms of cancer might be at risk of a COVID-19 vaccine causing their cancer to progress more rapidly.\n\nSo on Nov. 25, 2021, the brothers \u2014 who had written prior papers together \u2014 and other colleagues published a case report in which they described Michel Goldman\u2019s experience and urged the scientific community to study the phenomenon to see if it occurred in patients diagnosed with AITL.\n\n\u201cSince nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines strongly activate T follicular helper cells, it is important to explore the possible impact of approved SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines on neoplasms affecting this cell type,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThe brothers said the case study \u201csuggests that vaccination with the [Pfizer-BioNTech] BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine might induce rapid progression of AITL.\u201d\n\nThey noted, however, that it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to extrapolate the findings from Michel Goldman\u2019s case to other patients with the same kind of cancer and that \u201cdedicated studies are needed.\u201d\n\nGoing Public Was \u2018The Right Thing to Do\u2019\n\nMichel Goldman\u2019s case study added to the scientific literature that aims to understand the relationships between mRNA vaccines and the functioning of helper T-cells.\n\nFor instance, previous researchers have noted mRNA vaccines rev up helper T-cells, which may explain why Michel Goldman\u2019s AILT went into overdrive following his third booster shot.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the shots gave such a jolt to his helper T cells that they went berserk,\u201d The Atlantic reported. \u201cIf they were prone to forming tumors, or if they were already cancerous, then overstimulation could have made the problem even worse.\u201d\n\nResearch involving body scans of some people who get mRNA vaccines \u2014 including cancer patients \u2014 shows heightened activity in the lymph nodes near the armpit on the side where the shot was received.\n\nIn February 2018, a team of researchers at Columbia University\u2019s Institute for Cancer Genetics published a study using mice with a pair of gene mutations \u2014 the same two mutations found in Michel Goldman\u2019s tumor \u2014 showing that the mutations predispose T-cells to go rogue.\n\nThe study also showed that when the mice were injected with red blood cells from sheep \u2014 as an experimental stand-in for invading microbes \u2014 the mice developed the same subtype of lymphoma Michel Goldman had.\n\nMichel Goldman previously headed a $2 billion European endeavor to accelerate the research of new medicines and in December 2020, he publicly spoke out in support of the safety of mRNA vaccines \u2014 the technology used in both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAt that time, he said the highest risk \u2014 especially for vulnerable people \u2014 is not to be vaccinated and that his main concern about mRNA vaccination was that people might use the possible side effects as an argument against getting the vaccine.\n\nHe currently leads the Institute for Interdisciplinary Innovation in Healthcare, or I3h, a university hub aimed at assisting in drug-design projects.\n\nMichel Goldman doesn\u2019t regret going public with his case, even though it presented challenging evidence regarding the safety of mRNA vaccines for individuals such as himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still convinced it was the right thing to do,\u201d he told The Atlantic.\n\nHe remains adamant that COVID-19 vaccines are useful for the vast majority of people, but he is unsure whether he himself will get another booster dose.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I will do,\u201d he said.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title":
