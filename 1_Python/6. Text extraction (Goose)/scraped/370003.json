There are three basic reasons why one should prefer homeopathy for this problem.\n\nOne, it is the most natural and safest treatment. As it is based on the principle of \u201dlike cures like\u201d it forms a natural way of conditioning our healing responses also. The substances used in homoeopathy are in a highly diluted state and they act very safely \u2013 without any side-effect. Two, as it is a natural form of medication it does not suppress the disease. Three, the beneficial effects achieved with homeopathic medicines are lasting and do not vanish once the treatment is stopped.\n\nIt is nasal allergy which is also referred to as hay fever. This mostly affects our nasal path (nose tract) and the conjunctiva of the eyes. Its symptoms are frequent sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, congestion, and itchy eyes, nose, and roof of the mouth or the throat.\n\nAllergic rhinitis is like any other allergy. The only difference is that the fight between the antigen and the antibodies takes place in the nose, eyes, etc.\n\nAs we breathe, we take in many substances along with the air. Substances such as pollens, animal dander and smoke (allergens), for some individuals, are countered by the body\u2019s own defence system in our nose. They are attacked by the already developed antibodies in our system. This is called an allergic reaction, which also results in the release of an inflammatory chemical called histamine. It causes the swelling of the mucous membranes in our nose, sinuses and eyes, leading to a runny nose, watery eyes and sneezing.\n\nThe most common allergens are pollens (released by trees, grasses or weeds.), animal dander, dust mites, molds, dust and smoke. For those who have seasonal allergies, pollens are the main culprit, and for those who suffer all the year around animal dander, dust mites, cockroaches and molds are the culprits.\n\nBut it is actually no fault of the person who suffers from this allergy. It is your body\u2019s own watchdogs that have (by mistake) started fighting the substances that are not at all harmful to you. The hereditary factor plays a major role. If one of your parents is suffering from any kind of allergy the chances are that you would also develop an allergy of some sorts. If both parents suffer from allergy, the risk for you to develop allergy is 70 per cent.\n\nThe homeopathic medicines used in treating allergic rhinitis are Sabadilla, Natrum Mur, Arundo, Allium Cepa, Histaminum and Wyethia. Another medicine that has been introduced and has a great role in treating allergic rhinitis is Glaphimia Glauca. The medicines mentioned are for information only. Self-medication can be harmful.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nasal Allergy treatment with homeopathy - Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "description": "The homeopathic medicines for nose allergies that bring relief include Sabadilla, Natrum Mur, Arundo, Allium Cepa, Histaminum and Wyethia.", "url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/allergy/homeopathic-treatment-of-nose-allergy/", "site_name": "Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DrHomeo/292178394174737?", "article:section": "allergy", "article:published_time": "2008-08-03T10:42:35+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-08-17T05:37:59+00:00", "updated_time": "2018-08-17T05:37:59+00:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fallergy%2Fhomeopathic-treatment-of-nose-allergy%2F&t=Nasal%20Allergy%20treatment%20with%20homeopathy", "#", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fallergy%2Fhomeopathic-treatment-of-nose-allergy%2F&title=Nasal%20Allergy%20treatment%20with%20homeopathy"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2008-08-03T10:42:35+00:00"}
