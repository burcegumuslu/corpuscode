If there were an effective vaccine, though, you could develop immunity without having to get sick, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nDietary supplements aren't meant to prevent or treat COVID, per the CDC. But certain vitamins and minerals may have effects on the immune system \u2014 specifically, how well it fights infections, inflammation and swelling, the agency adds. If your diet is deficient in the recommended levels of essential vitamins and minerals, supplements may help fill that gap.\n\nSome of the warnings come from both the FTC and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), which bans the sale of misbranded or unapproved new drugs. The list of products claiming to boost immunity against COVID is a mishmash of intravenous therapies, herbs, dietary supplements, essential oils, colloidal silver therapies and so on. The latest offender: a company that had marketed an eyelid and eyelash solution as a coronavirus killer.\n\nEven if you do develop immunity, scientists don't yet know how long it may last. According to Gombart, some studies show that you'll be immune from infection for three months. However, he also cites an October 2020 study in \u200bImmunity\u200b suggesting that neutralizing and \"spike-specific\" (targeting spike proteins on the surface of the virus) antibodies persist for five to seven months.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Adopting a healthy lifestyle can support your immune system, but experts say there's no evidence that \"boosting\" your immunity can prevent or treat COVID-19.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13729138-boost-immune-system-coronavirus/", "title": "Why 'Boosting Your Immune System' Won't Stop COVID-19 | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2F953873323c9446289386b3905b3db270.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/article/13725587-supplements-boost-immune-system/", "/article/13730767-covid-vaccine-immunity-vs-natural-immunity/", "/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725963-what-is-immune-system/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279364/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279396/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728693-weakened-immune-system-signs/", "/article/13725587-supplements-boost-immune-system/", "/article/13730767-covid-vaccine-immunity-vs-natural-immunity/", "/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/novel-coronavirus-structure-reveals-targets-vaccines-treatments", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770758", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/how-they-work.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725962-protein-and-immune-system/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723551/", "https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/faculty-staff/adrian-gombart", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725587-supplements-boost-immune-system/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/food-and-COVID-19.html", "https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-C", "https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-D", "https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-7/", "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21196-immune-system", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727799-vaccine-schedule/", "https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-boost-your-immune-system", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13723669-boost-your-immune-system/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13724994-what-weakens-immune-system/", "https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/warning-letters?field_tags_tid%5B0%5D=361", "https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2020/08/20-more-warning-letters-tell-companies-cut-out-unproven", "https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products", "https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Lyke-Kirsten/", "https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(20)30445-3", "https://www.uchealth.org/today/coronavirus-vaccines-101-what-you-need-to-know/", "https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725173-how-and-when-to-wash-your-hands/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727169-how-to-buy-wash-cloth-face-mask/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728584-what-to-clean-every-day-covid/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727391-covid-essentials/"], "authors": ["Karen Pallarito"], "publish_date": null}
