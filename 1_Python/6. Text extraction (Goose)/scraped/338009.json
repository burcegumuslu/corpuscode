Currently 61.9% of the world population has received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine) but that\u2019s okay, however, Gates said, as in many places, the virus itself, which creates a level of immunity, and has \u201cdone a better job of getting out to the world population than we have with vaccines.\u201d\n\nFinally, Gates insisted that the cost of being \u201cprepared\u201d for the next pandemic wouldn\u2019t be that difficult. For instance, Gates said, having a mutable mRNA vaccine platform is one way vaccine-makers might be able to prepare themselves.\n\nHe added that the world should move faster in the future to develop and distribute vaccines, calling on governments to invest now.\n\nDespite becoming an object of public scorn during the pandemic, Gates and his foundation are undeterred: the billionaire is already plowing millions of dollars into a foundation helping to prepare for \u2018the next\u2019 pandemic.\n\nThe whole operation is amusing since nobody knows what the next pandemic will be.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bill Gates Credits Natural Infection With Doing a \"Better Job\" of Bolstering Immunity", "description": "\"The virus itself, which creates a level of immunity, has \"done a better job of getting out to the world population than we have with vaccines.\"", "url": "https://wearechange.org/bill-gates-credits-natural-infection-with-doing-a-better-job-of-bolstering-immunity/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2022-02-20T02:51:36+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/tyutyut-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bill-gates-says-covid-risks-have-dramatically-reduced-but-another-pandemic-is-coming/ar-AAU2wVm", "https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/bill-gates-credits-natural-infection-doing-better-job-bolstering-covid-immunity", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2022-02-20T02:51:36+00:00"}
