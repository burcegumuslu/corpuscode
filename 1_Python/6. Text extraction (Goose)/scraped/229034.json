Another Nobel Prize went to the \u201cmedical doctor-turned-virologist\u201d who discovered that the HPV virus was causing cervical cancer. In his acceptance speech, he mused that there may be a bovine polyoma virus\u2014a multiple tumor virus in cattle\u2014that could be playing a role in human colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, but no polyoma virus had ever been discovered in meat\u2026until now.\n\nAs I discuss in my video The Role of Burger Viruses in Cancer, polyomaviruses are a particular concern\u2014not only because they are known to be carcinogenic, but also because they can survive cooking temperatures. Since a single burger these days can contain meat from \u201cmany dozens of animals,\u201d researchers felt \u201cthis could present an ideal situation for virus-hunting\u2026\u201d Researchers from the National Cancer Institute purchased meat samples from three separate supermarkets and found three different polyomaviruses in ground beef, as you can see at 1:52 in my video. Now, just because three types of \u201cpolyomavirus species are commonly detectable in food-grade ground beef\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are causing human disease. What made this Nobel laureate suspect them? Well, for one thing, some people got cancer right where they had been vaccinated for smallpox\u2014a whole bunch of different cancers, in fact. The vaccine had been harvested from the skin of calves, so \u201cit is possible\u201d there could have been some cancer-causing cow virus.\n\n\u201cMany people are exposed to potentially virus-contaminated meat and dairy products\u201d through their diets, but those in the industry, \u201csuch as farm workers, butchers, veterinarians, and employees in dairies,\u201d would be even more exposed. Do these groups have higher cancer incidence? Indeed, it now appears to be clear \u201cthat workers in the meat industry are at increased risk of developing and dying from cancer.\u201d\n\nAnother reason to suspect the involvement of some kind of bovine infectious factor in colorectal cancer is the fact that there appear to be relatively low rates of colorectal cancer in countries where not a lot of beef is eaten. And, when meat consumption suddenly increases, rates shoot up, as you can see at 3:15 in my video. \u201cThe only exception is Mongolia where they have low rates of colon cancer and eat a lot of red meat, but there they eat yak.\u201d Maybe yaks don\u2019t harbor the same viruses.\n\nCan\u2019t you just avoid steak tartare? Even steak cooked \u201cmedium\u201d may not reach internal temperatures above 70\u00b0 Celsius, and it takes temperatures higher than that to inactivate some of these viruses, so we would expect viruses to survive both cooking and pasteurization. In fact, researchers followed up with a paper suggesting the consumption of dairy products may \u201crepresent one of the main risk factors for the development of breast cancer\u201d in humans. The recent discovery of a larger number of presumably new viruses in the blood, meat, and milk of dairy cows should be investigated, since one might speculate that infectious \u201cagents present in dairy products possess a higher affinity to mammary [breast] cells,\u201d since they came from breast cells. The fact that people with lactose intolerance, who tend to avoid milk and dairy throughout their lives, have lower rates of breast and other cancers could be seen as supporting this concept. Though, there are certainly other reasons dairy may increase cancer risk, such as increasing levels of the cancer-promoting growth hormone IGF-1 or adversely affecting our gut microbiome. Or, for that matter, maybe the plant-based milks they\u2019re drinking instead could be protective. That\u2019s the problem with population studies: You can\u2019t tease out cause and effect. It doesn\u2019t matter how many viruses are found in retail beef, pork, and chicken, as you can see at 5:16 in my video, if we can\u2019t connect the dots.\n\nCan\u2019t we just look for the presence of these viruses within human tumors? Researchers have tried and did find some, but even if you don\u2019t find any, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean viruses didn\u2019t play a role. There\u2019s a \u201cviral hit-and-run\u201d theory of cancer development that suggests that certain viruses can slip in and out of our DNA to initiate the cancer, but be long gone by the time the tumor matures.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done. But, if the link between bovine polyomaviruses and human disease pans out, the National Cancer Institute researchers envision the development of a high potency vaccine. So, just like the HPV vaccine may prevent cervical cancer from unsafe sex, perhaps one day, vaccines may prevent breast and colon cancer from unsafe sirloin.\n\nThis reminds me of the story of bovine leukemia virus and breast cancer. For more on that, see:\n\u2022 The Role of Bovine Leukemia Virus in Breast Cancer\n\u2022 The Best Diet for Colon Cancer Prevention\n\u2022 Banning Trans Fat in Processed Foods but Not Animal Fat\n\nWhat about chicken? Check out The Role of Poultry Viruses in Human Cancers and Poultry and Penis Cancer.\n\nOne of the problems with eating other animals is that we put ourselves at risk of their diseases. Not once have I diagnosed anyone with Dutch Elm Disease or a really bad case of aphids. See Eating Outside Our Kingdom for more on this concept.\n\nPS: If you haven\u2019t yet, you can subscribe to my free videos here and watch my live presentations:\n\u2022 2016: How Not To Die: The Role of Diet in Preventing, Arresting, and Reversing Our Top 15 Killers\n\u2022 2015: Food as Medicine: Preventing and Treating the Most Dreaded Diseases with Diet\n\u2022 2014: From Table to Able: Combating Disabling Diseases with Food\n\u2022 2013: More Than an Apple a Day\n\u2022 2012: Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "The Role of Meat and Dairy Viruses in Cancer | NutritionFacts.org", "type": "article", "image": "https://nutritionfacts.org/app/themes/sage/dist/images/default-image.png", "url": "https://nutritionfacts.org/2020/09/24/the-role-of-meat-and-dairy-viruses-in-cancer/", "site_name": "NutritionFacts.org"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23417394", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15489139", "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413_supp/full/488S16a.html?message-global=remove", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19588476", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-burger-viruses-in-cancer/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568187", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-burger-viruses-in-cancer/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568187", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19720205", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19720205", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11211014", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21497401", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22212999", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-burger-viruses-in-cancer/", "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413_supp/full/488S16a.html?message-global=remove", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23116715", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648405", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314053", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217712", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-burger-viruses-in-cancer/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186851", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-milk-infectious/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-breast-cancer/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/industry-response-to-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-breast-cancer/", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-diet-for-colon-cancer-prevention/", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/fast-food-tested-for-carcinogens/", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/banning-trans-fat-in-processed-foods-but-not-animal-fat/", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise/", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-poultry-viruses-in-human-cancers/", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/poultry-and-penis-cancer/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eating-outside-our-kingdom/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/subscribe", "https://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-weight-loss-live-presentation/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-not-to-die/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/", "http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "September 24, 2020"}
