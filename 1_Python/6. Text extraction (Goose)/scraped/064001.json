It shows pictures of what looks like blood clots yet never really confirms the true origins of them. To suggest that these were caused by Covid-19 vaccines as the film did would be kind of like showing pictures of mullets and then claiming that vaccines caused such hairstyles. In the film, a person blurred out did say in a distorted voice what sounded like, \u201cas a Canadian embalmer, I have found that everyone who I have embalmed for over a year had fibrous mass clots.\u201d However, you can\u2019t really tell who this person really is, because saying \u201cCanadian embalmer\u201d isn\u2019t quite the same as saying something like \u201cbillionaire who bought Twitter.\u201d It doesn\u2019t really pinpoint who the person is. In fact, you can\u2019t really tell the identities of many of the people featured in the film since there is relatively little use of captions.\n\n\n\n Bruce Y.

Yet once again, the individual shown in the film never died and no evidence points to a vaccine being responsible.\n\n \n\n A third clip used shows a royal guard fainting while standing next to the casket of Queen Elizabeth, a As with the others highlighted, the guard did not die. And while Twitter has thus far declined to flag the film for misinformation, numerous Twitter users have. A lengthy thread from one such account has revealed that countless examples of vaccine deaths in the documentary are outright false.In the film's trailer, footage of a basketball star collapsing on the court is cited as proof of the vaccine's dangers. In reality, the footage is from 2020, long before the vaccine became available to the entire public.Another clip from the trailer shows a woman in Argentina fainting and falling into a moving train. Yet once again, the individual shown in the film never died and no evidence points to a vaccine being responsible.A third clip used shows a royal guard fainting while standing next to the casket of Queen Elizabeth, a common occurrence among guards who must stand in one place for hours on end.\n\nIt is a waste of time one will never get back:A trailer for the video shows a basketball player, Keyotae Johnson, collapsing on a basketball court, which the film hints was supposedly caused by the covid-19 vaccine. But do note two things: this happened on Dec. 12, 2020--before the vaccines were even available. Also, Johnson didn't die!And:And it gives a good example using Tom Hanks.Here is more, from another source that analyzed the documentary:It noted:When I was in high school, in the Glee Club, one of the boys in the choir told me that in a previous year, while singing in a concert, one of the boys near him, dressed in a suit, started swaying and started to faint. The boys on either side of him caught him by his arms and carried him off the stage to a place where he could lie down. This was in the mid-60's. Happens more often than people think. Heck, some people faint just getting any shot. My 18-year old grandson almost faints when he has to get shots or blood drawn. It is just how he is.Personally, I think one of the greatest horror movies of all time was \"Silence of the Lambs.\" Really creepy. The guy who played \"Hannibal the cannibal\" deserved his Oscar!", "opengraph": {"description": "This is without a doubt the most horrific movie I have ever seen in my entire life.\n\nhttps://rumble.com/v1wcesu-died-suddenly-full-documentary-not-suitable-for-children.html", "url": "https://forums.carm.org/threads/the-horror-film-to-end-all-horror-films.12687/", "site_name": "CARM Forums", "type": "website", "title": "The Horror Film to end all horror films"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/11/22/new-died-suddenly-film-pushes-unfounded-depopulation-claims-about-covid-19-vaccine/?sh=6c23db5849d0", "https://angelarasmussen.org/", "https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/anti-vax-film-e2-80-98died-suddenly-e2-80-99-is-littered-with-fake-claims-testing-boundaries-of-musk-e2-80-99s-twitter/ar-AA14qbjW", "https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/20220915151182/why-do-queen-royal-guards-faint/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-11-24T13:27:22-0700"}
