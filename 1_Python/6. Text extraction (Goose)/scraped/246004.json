They filed papers in court, and they won their case.\n\nHere is the issue in a nutshell: In 1986, a law, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, was passed. It insanely excused vaccine makers from legal liability stemming from unsafe vaccines and the injuries they cause. Buried in the law was a provision ordering the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to update Congress, every two years, on its efforts to improve vaccine safety.\n\nKennedy and Bigtree thought it would be very interesting to read these HHS reports\u2014all 16 of them. So they filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and then\u2026nothing. No replies.\n\nKennedy and Bigtree then went to court to obtain the information\u2014and after wrangling and stonewalling, HHS admitted it has NO such reports in its archives.\n\nIN OTHER WORDS, SINCE 1988, HHS HAS FAILED TO UPDATE CONGRESS ON ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE VACCINE SAFETY.\n\nAnd the further implication is: there are no reports, because HHS has done nothing to improve vaccine safety in all these years.\n\nThe original 1986 law removed all liability from vaccine makers BECAUSE THERE WAS A PROBLEM, AND THAT PROBLEM WAS VACCINE SAFETY.\n\nCongress protected billions of dollars that could never be sought in court from vaccine manufacturers. Those law suits, filed by parents of vaccine-injured children, would henceforth be illegal. That was the substance of the law.\n\nSo, did Congress recognize there was a serious vaccine safety problem? You bet your life they did, and to make it seem they cared, they charged HHS with doing something about it, and reporting to them (Congress) every two years.\n\nAnd thanks to the efforts of Kennedy and Bigtree, all this is now exposed.\n\nYou can read the court judgement and relevant press release in this pdf document, here.\n\nIn 1986, vaccine makers went to the federal government and said they were going to get out of the vaccine business, because juries were awarding too much money in court, to parents of vaccine-injured children. The feds basically said, \u201cWe\u2019ll ram through a law eliminating those law suits,\u201d and they did. EVERYBODY AND HIS BROTHER KNEW VACCINE SAFETY WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM\u2026\n\nIncluding the US Department of Health and Human Services, which was tasked with doing something about it. Back in 1986.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s discovered there is no evidence they lifted a finger these last 32 years.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve lurched forward, introducing more and more vaccines into the childhood schedule\u2014and never running studies to gauge the toxic effects of the increased load.\n\nTo any person with open eyes, these are the actions of criminals pretending to be scientists.\n\nIf you want to glimpse the level of profound criminality, talk to the mother of a bright, happy, open child who incurred brain damage after a vaccination and checked out of this world.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Principia Scientific Intl. | A science-based community", "type": "blog", "title": "Court: US government broke the law on vaccine safety for 30 years | Principia Scientific Intl.", "description": "For 30 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) broke the law regarding vaccine safety, and no one noticed or cared.", "url": "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/", "image": "https://principia-scientific.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vaccine.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://principia-scientific.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "792", "image:height": "608"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr", "https://worldmercuryproject.org/", "https://twitter.com/delbigtree", "https://twitter.com/HighWireTalk", "https://www.facebook.com/HighWireTalk", "http://icandecide.org/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIRXxEYnkxA", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5546", "http://icandecide.org/government/ICAN-HHS-Stipulated-Order-July-2018.pdf", "https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/vaccine-woman-2/", "https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2018/07/16/us-government-exposed-for-30-years-it-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety/", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=twitter", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=facebook", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=telegram", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=custom-1654796357", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=linkedin", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=reddit", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Court%3A%20US%20government%20broke%20the%20law%20on%20vaccine%20safety%20for%2030%20years&body=https%3A%2F%2Fprincipia-scientific.com%2Fcourt-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years%2F&share=email", "#", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=pinterest", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=pocket", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=tumblr", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=skype", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://principia-scientific.com/court-us-government-broke-the-law-on-vaccine-safety-for-30-years/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "July 18, 2018"}
