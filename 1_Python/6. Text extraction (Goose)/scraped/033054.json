You have previously heard me talk about vaccination certificates as a \u201cplan B\u201d. Now that situation is here,\u201d Lind said.\n\nHow will Sweden use the vaccine pass?\n\nThe Swedish Public Health Agency said in a press release on Wednesday afternoon that they intended to bring back restrictions for all indoor events with more than 100 participants from December 1st.\n\nThese restrictions might include a limit on the maximum number of people allowed to attend per square meter, or a minimum distance requirement between different groups of people attending. At the press conference, Tegmark Wisell would not give any further details, only saying that the restrictions would \u201cbe similar\u201d to those in place during earlier waves of infection.\n\nThe new restrictions will apply to theatres, concerts, cinemas, night clubs, sports events, dance performances, funfairs, and amusement parks, markets, conferences, demonstrations, and religious services.\n\nInstitutions and event organisers will be excused the new restrictions if they require that all those attending have shown a valid vaccination certificate.\n\nThe possibility of requiring a vaccine pass is not currently expected to be extended to restaurants, bars or similar establishments, as has been the case in France, Denmark and other countries \u2014 so long as they do not hold dance events.\n\nWhat will be required for a vaccination certificate to be valid?\n\nUnlike similar health or Covid passes brought in elsewhere in Europe, Sweden\u2019s requirement is for vaccination and vaccination alone, with those who have received their final vaccine dose at least two weeks before attending an event counted as fully vaccinated. Proof of a negative test result or evidence of recovery from a Covid-19 infection will not be enough to enter events requiring a certificate.\n\u2022 None Peter Hultqvist supports a proposal within the EU that has come from the Baltic countries for a training mission in Ukraine.\n\u2022 None This could mean that Sweden will eventually send officers to the country to train the military.\n\nMinister of Defence of Sweden Peter Hultqvist agreed to send Swedish troops to Ukraine for a training mission led by the European Union. Hultqvist stated this on Swedish radio Ekot.\n\n\u201cWe consider it very important to highlight the EU\u2019s ambitions to contribute to the security and sovereignty of Ukraine,\u201d Swedish Defense Minister said.\n\nHultqvist intends to find out how Sweden can take part in this.\n\nIn October, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry announced that an EU military advisory and training mission would be deployed in the country by the end of this year.\n\nEarlier it became known that Brussels sent experts to Ukraine to study the country\u2019s needs in the deployment of the EU military training mission.\n\nLast week, Swedish Ambassador to Ukraine Tobias Tiberg said that the European Union would prepare an assessment of the security situation on the Ukrainian border, where Russian troops are concentrated.", "opengraph": {"title": "Sweden Introduces Vaccine Passports, Considers Deploying Troops to Ukraine", "description": "To train Ukrainians with the EU.
