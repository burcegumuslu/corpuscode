Deemed \u201canti-vaxxers,\u201d many were shunned, canceled online, and fired from their jobs. They were made to feel worse than second-class citizens, and many were deprived of their basic legal and constitutional rights, all because they attempted to exercise some caution about a vaccine that was experimental and proven to be highly dangerous for millions of people.\n\nBut as it turns out, the skeptical \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019 were justified in their refusal to take the jab, mostly because the claim being pushed by governments and the mainstream \u2018scientific\u2019 community that the vaccines prevented the spread of COVID-19 was a lie, according to a comprehensive investigative report published this week in Tablet Magazine:\n\nVaccine mandates were mainly rationalized through the belief that the higher the rate of vaccination, the less the virus would spread. For example, during oral arguments for Biden\u2019s health care worker mandate, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Elena Kagan claimed that health care workers had to get vaccinated \u201cso that you\u2019re not transmitting the disease.\u201d But recently, on Oct. 10, 2022, a Pfizer spokesperson told the European Parliament that the vaccines had never actually been tested for preventing transmission. While this was presented on social media as \u201cbreaking news,\u201d the fact that the vaccines were not tested for this purpose has been documented extensively ever since Pfizer and Moderna received their original Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).\n\nOn Dec. 10, 2020, in a Food and Drug Administration meeting where the first mRNA vaccines were authorized, an adviser to the agency, Dr. Patrick Moore, said: \u201cPfizer has presented no evidence in its data today that the vaccine has any effect on virus carriage or shedding, which is the fundamental basis for herd immunity.\u201d Despite the information that was presented for individual efficacy, Moore added that \u201cwe really, as of right now, do not have any evidence that it will have an impact, social-wide, on the epidemic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the FDA EUA press release from December 2020 confirms that there was no \u201cevidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-COV-2 from person to person.\u201d\n\nPut another way, most people were led to believe the vaccines prevented the spread of the virus because they were told that was the case by liars who wanted to mislead the masses so they could impose their will. This was also done, of course, with the help of the deep state\u2019s allies in the \u2018mainstream\u2019 media and on the major social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, all of whom censored or took down content that questioned the \u2018accepted official narratives\u2019 on COVID.\n\n\u201cFor anyone content with their vaccination status, this might not be a big deal. Yes, the vaccine information that was provided in 2021 wasn\u2019t entirely accurate, but you might still feel that getting vaccinated was the right decision,\u201d Tablet Magazine noted, before pointing out: \u201cHowever, being misinformed about potential benefits and risks is an enormous deal for, say, a male college athlete who got vaccinated because he wanted to protect his elderly family members, but who then developed myocarditis.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which led to crippling economic shutdowns and massive shifts in wealth, was a scam from start to finish. And we still have not felt all of the effects of the bad policy decisions, including keeping kids out of school for two years.", "opengraph": {"title": "FRAUD FROM DAY ONE: Stunning new report notes that COVID vaccines NEVER prevented spread of the virus", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2022-10-24-new-report-covid-vaccines-never-prevented-spread-of-virus.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Once again, it turns out that the alternative media \u2014 outlets like ours, for instance \u2014 were 100 percent right about the most life-changing health event of our lifetimes thus far: the COVID-19 pandemic.
