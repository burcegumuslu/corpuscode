With the accelerator serving as a sort of microscope, scientists will be able to construct atomic-level three-dimensional maps that can then serve as models for drugs that would bind to the virus, potentially halting or treating it.\n\n\u201cWe shine the light on the proteins and the light that scatters off them tells us where every atom in the (CoViD-19) protein molecule is. You need to know what the protein looks like so you can design a drug to attach to it. It\u2019s like designing a key for a lock, you need to know the dimensions of the keyhole.\u201d\n\nThe Melbourne team will be working with dozens of protein samples submitted from colleagues across the world that could be good fits for binding to CoViD-19 in a manner that would blunt the disease\u2019s effects or protect from it.\n\nThe government funded project could help boost the time it takes to develop a vaccine, which some researchers believe could take anywhere from 18 months to several years to develop.\n\nAround 35 private companies and academic institutions are working at a feverish pace to develop an effective vaccine or treatment for CoViD-19, which has infected over 750,000 people and upended the world economy, earning the distinction of being arguably the worst global health crisis of the 21st century.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-19-vaccine.png", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/03/australia-using-light-one-million-times-brighter-than-sun-to-find-covid-19-vaccine.html", "title": "Australia Using Light One Million Times Brighter Than Sun to Find COVID-19 Vaccine", "description": "Scientists are using a particle accelerator to help fast-track the hunt for a COVID-19 vaccine.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:section": "Science & Tech", "updated_time": "2020-03-31T15:26:40-05:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid-19-vaccine.png", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Vaccine", "image:type": "image/png", "article:published_time": "2020-03-31T15:25:04-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-03-31T15:26:40-05:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "740", "height": "416", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ANSTO's COVID-19 research support\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3DhtOSvV6I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3DhtOSvV6I?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://themindunleashed.com/", "https://www.ansto.gov.au/research/facilities/australian-synchrotron/overview#content-how-it-works", "https://www.france24.com/en/20200331-australia-enlists-particle-accelerator-in-coronavirus-fight", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-it-be-ready", "https://themindunleashed.com/author/eliasmarat", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/03/australia-using-light-one-million-times-brighter-than-sun-to-find-covid-19-vaccine.html", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["Elias Marat"], "publish_date": "2020-03-31T15:25:04-05:00"}
