This is a tragedy that highlights the severe limitations of the program.\u201d\n\nCHD Acting President Laura Bono called the payouts for myocarditis \u201cinsulting,\u201d given that mortality rates increase to 50% within five years of diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThe CICP is a pathetic, government-run program that gives complete liability protection to the very industries profiting from the COVID vaccine or product. While victims linger with their injuries, paying out-of-pocket for expenses, or at worst die, the industries run to the bank.\u201d\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, people claiming injuries related to COVID-19 vaccines and other countermeasures submitted 11,425 requests for compensation.\n\nOf those, only 19 have been declared eligible for compensation and are undergoing a \u201cmedical benefits review\u201d to determine payment.\n\nThe anaphylaxis case had been pending medical benefits review since the fall of 2021, and the two myocarditis cases had been pending review since January.\n\nDuring the medical benefits review, HRSA determines any costs remaining after insurance, workers\u2019 comp, disability or other reimbursements or payments.\n\nWayne Rohde, an expert in vaccine injury compensation, wrote on his Substack that given the \u201c18+ months to review previous medical benefits that may have been awarded to the injured party [the anaphylaxis case], this process tells me it was a major injury that resulted in very large medical bills.\u201d\n\nMyocarditis is a serious condition that also requires a lot of medical attention, Rohde said.\n\nTo date, there have been 1,541,275 reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\nHow does vaccine injury compensation work? the VICP and CICP\n\nHRSA, which operates under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers two vaccine injury compensation programs: the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP).\n\nThe VICP is a special, no-fault tribunal housed within the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that handles injury claims for 16 common vaccines on the childhood vaccination schedule. To date, it has awarded more than $4 billion for medical bills, lost wages, lawyer fees, and pain and suffering to thousands of people for vaccine injuries.\n\nThe program does not currently cover COVID-19 vaccine injuries. Should COVID-19 vaccines be moved into the program, any injuries would be handled by the already overwhelmed VICP.\n\nThe CICP, the only program that covers COVID-19 vaccine injuries at this time, is even less equipped to deal with them, Rohde told The Defender.\n\n\u201cFor COVID-19 vaccine-injured people, the CICP is the worst place, it\u2019s the worst option,\u201d Rohde said, \u201cbecause it is not really a compensation program, it\u2019s a reimbursement program for medical costs.\u201d\n\nThe CICP allows individuals to claim compensation only for unreimbursed medical expenses \u2014 meaning those not fully reimbursed by insurance or government programs, such as Medicaid \u2014 for death and for lost wages up to $50,000.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under the CICP:\n\n\u201cEligible individuals may be compensated for certain reasonable and necessary medical expenses and for lost employment income at the time of the injury. Death benefits may be paid to certain survivors of covered countermeasures recipients who have died as a direct result of the covered countermeasure injury.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is the payer of last resort. Therefore, payments are reduced by those of other third-party payers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pain and suffering here, there\u2019s nothing,\u201d Rohde said.\n\nBecause the CICP reviews and resolves claims through an administrative rather than a judicial process, no details other than the amount of the payments have to be shared with the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s designed to be very convoluted, very non-transparent,\u201d Rohde said.\n\nThe CICP was known for its cumbersome claims process and low likelihood of success for claimants even before the pandemic. Since then, it has seen unsustainable growth.\n\nAccording to HRSA\u2019s numbers, of the 11,941 claims filed with the CICP since 2010, nearly 11,000 of them are still under review.\n\nThe HRSA budget for COVID-19 vaccine injury compensation will increase in fiscal year 2023 \u2014 from approximately $1 million to $5 million \u2014 and its budget for staffing and contractors will jump from $5 million to $9.5 million.\n\nHow would COVID vaccine injury compensation change under the VICP?\n\nFor vaccine injury claims to be covered under the VICP rather than the CICP, three requirements must be met:\n\u2022 None The vaccine needs to be recommended for routine administration for children and/or pregnant women.\n\u2022 None It needs to have an excise tax imposed upon it through the legislature.\n\u2022 None There needs to be a notice of coverage published in the federal record.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine was added to the childhood immunization schedule earlier this year \u2014 but the next two steps in the process have yet to be completed and public health officials have not indicated when this might happen.\n\nThe National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine met for three days last month \u2014 behind closed doors, except for a two-hour public comment period \u2014 to review the epidemiological, clinical and biological evidence on adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe committee will generate a report that will be used to add injuries to the federal Vaccine Injury Table, which lists known adverse events associated with existing vaccines.\n\nThis list helps the VICP and the CICP decide whether to compensate vaccine injury claims.\n\nAt the National Academies meeting, Professor Renee Gentry, director of the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic at The George Washington University Law School, told the committee the stakeholders that created the VICP \u2014 vaccine manufacturers, lawyers and parents \u2014 set it up to be petitioner-friendly, informal, generous and non-adversarial.\n\nBut instead, she said, HHS has been \u201cunrelenting\u201d in its opposition to recognizing vaccine injuries.\n\n\u201cI believe the VICP as it exists today would be unrecognizable to those original stakeholders,\u201d she said.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.
