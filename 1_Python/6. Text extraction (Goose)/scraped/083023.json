A leaked document broken down by Twitter user Ehden reveals the shocking terms of Pfizer\u2019s international COVID-19 vaccine agreements.\n\n\u201cThese agreements are confidential, but luckily one country did not protect the contract document well enough, so I managed to get a hold of a copy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs you are about to see, there is a good reason why Pfizer was fighting to hide the details of these contracts.\u201d\n\nAn ironclad agreement, all on Pfizer\u2019s terms\n\nThe alleged indemnification agreement, reportedly between Pfizer and Albania, was originally posted in snippets on Twitter, but Twitter now has them marked as \u201cunavailable.\u201d Copies of the tweets are available on Treadreader, however.\n\nThe Albania agreement appears very similar to another contract, published online, between Pfizer and the Dominican Republic. It covers not only COVID-19 vaccines, but any product that enhances the use or effects of such vaccines.\n\nCountries that purchase Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 shot must acknowledge that \u201cPfizer\u2019s efforts to develop and manufacture the Product\u201d are \u201csubject to significant risks and uncertainties.\u201d\n\nAnd in the event that a drug or other treatment comes out that can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19, the agreement stands, and the country must follow through with their order. Ivermectin, for instance, is not only safe, inexpensive and widely available but has been found to reduce COVID-19 mortality by 81%. Yet, it continues to be ignored in favor of more expensive, and less effective, treatments and mass experimental vaccination.\n\n\u201cIf you were wondering why #Ivermectin was suppressed,\u201d Ehden wrote, \u201cwell, it is because the agreement that countries had with Pfizer does not allow them to escape their contract, which states that even if a drug will be found to treat COVID19 the contract cannot be voided.\u201d\n\nEven if Pfizer fails to deliver vaccine doses within their estimated delivery period, the purchaser may not cancel the order. Further, Pfizer can make adjustments to the number of contracted doses and their delivery schedule, \u201cbased on principles to be determined by Pfizer,\u201d and the country buying the vaccines must \u201cagree to any revision.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the vaccines are delivered severely late, even at a point when they\u2019re no longer needed, as it\u2019s made clear that \u201cUnder no circumstances will Pfizer be subject to or liable for any late delivery penalties.\u201d As you might suspect, the contract also forbids returns \u201cunder any circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe big secret: Pfizer charged U.S. More Than Other Countries\n\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cfree\u201d to receive in the U.S., they\u2019re being paid for by taxpayer dollars at a rate of $19.5011 per dose. Albania, the leaked contract revealed, paid $12 per dose, while the EU paid $14.70 per shot. While charging different prices to different purchases is common in the drug industry, it\u2019s often frowned upon.\n\nIn the case of the price disparity between the U.S. and the EU, Pfizer is said to have given a price break to the EU because it financially supported the development of their COVID-19 vaccine. Still, Ehden noted, \u201cU.S. taxpayers got screwed by Pfizer, probably also Israel.\u201d Also, Pfizer makes a point to note that countries have no right to withhold payment to the company for any reason.\n\nApparently, this includes in the case of receiving damaged goods. Purchasers of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines are not entitled to reject them \u201cbased on service complaints,\u201d unless they do not conform to specifications or the FDA\u2019s Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. And, Ehden adds, \u201cThis agreement is above any local law of the state.\u201d\n\nWhile the purchaser has virtually no way of canceling the contract, Pfizer can terminate the agreement in the event of a \u201cmaterial breach\u201d of any term in their contract.\n\nThe purchaser of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine must also acknowledge two facts that have largely been brushed under the rug: Both their efficacy and risks are unknown. According to section 5.5 of the contract:\n\n\u201cPurchaser acknowledges that the Vaccine and materials related to the Vaccine, and their components and constituent materials are being rapidly developed due to the emergency circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be studied after provision of the Vaccine to Purchaser under this Agreement.\n\n\u201cPurchaser further acknowledges that the long-term effects and efficacy of the Vaccine are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the Vaccine that are not currently known.\u201d\n\nIndemnification by the purchaser is also explicitly required by the contract, which states, under section 8.1:\n\n\u201cPurchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pfizer, BioNTech, each of their Affiliates, contractors, sub-contractors, licensors, licensees, sub-licensees, distributors, contract manufacturers, services providers, clinical trial researchers, third parties to whom Pfizer or BioNTech or any of their respective Affiliates may directly or indirectly owe an indemnity based on the research \u2026\n\n\u201cfrom and against any and all suits, claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses of an investigation or litigation \u2026 arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the Vaccine \u2026\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the purchaser must also keep the terms of the contract confidential for a period of 10 years.\n\nNot only does Pfizer have total indemnification, but there\u2019s also a section in the contract titled, \u201cAssumption of Defense by Purchaser,\u201d which states that in the event Pfizer suffers losses for which it is seeking indemnification, the purchaser \u201cshall promptly assume conduct and control of the defense of such Indemnified Claims on behalf of the Indemnitee with counsel acceptable to Indemnitee(s), whether or not the Indemnified Claim is rightfully brought.\u201d Ehden notes:\n\n\u201cPfizer is making sure the country will pay for everything: \u2018Costs and expenses, including \u2026 fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnitee(s) in connection with any Indemnified Claim shall be reimbursed on a quarterly basis by Purchaser.\u2019\u201d\n\nBuried in the March 17, 2020, Federal Register \u2014 the daily journal of the U.S. government \u2014 in a document titled, \u201cDeclaration Under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for Medical Countermeasures Against COVID-19,\u201d is language that establishes a new COVID-19 vaccine court \u2014 similar to the federal vaccine court that already exists.\n\nIn the U.S., vaccine makers already enjoy full indemnity against injuries occurring from this or any other pandemic vaccine under the PREP Act. If you\u2019re injured by a COVID vaccine (or a select group of other vaccines designated under the act), you\u2019d have to file a compensation claim with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), which is funded by U.S. taxpayers via Congressional appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).\n\nWhile similar to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), which applies to nonpandemic vaccines, the CICP is even less generous when it comes to compensation. As reported by Dr. Meryl Nass,25 the maximum payout you can receive \u2014 even in cases of permanent disability or death \u2014 is $250,000 per person; however, you\u2019d have to exhaust your private insurance policy before the CICP gives you a dime.\n\nThe CICP also has a one-year statute of limitations, so you have to act quickly, which is also difficult since it\u2019s unknown if long-term effects could occur more than a year later.\n\nAs is apparent in Pfizer\u2019s confidential contract with Albania, the drug giant wants governments to guarantee the company will be compensated for any expenses resulting from injury lawsuits against it. Pfizer has also demanded that countries put up sovereign assets, including bank reserves, military bases and embassy buildings, as collateral for expected vaccine injury lawsuits resulting from its COVID-19 inoculation.\n\nNew Delhi-based World Is One News (WION) reported in February 2021 that Brazil rejected Pfizer\u2019s demands, calling them \u201cabusive.\u201d The demands included that Brazil:\n\u2022 \u201cWaives sovereignty of its assets abroad in favor of Pfizer.\u201d\n\u2022 Not apply its domestic laws to the company.\n\u2022 Exempt Pfizer from all civil liability for side effects.\n\nSTAT News also referred to concerns by legal experts, who also suggested Pfizer\u2019s demands were an abuse of power. Mark Eccleston-Turner, a lecturer in global health law at Keele University in England, told STAT:\n\n\u201c[Pfizer] is trying to eke out as much profit and minimize its risk at every juncture with this vaccine development then this vaccine rollout. Now, the vaccine development has been heavily subsidized already. So there\u2019s very minimal risk for the manufacturer involved there.\u201d\n\nPfizer continues to sign lucrative secret vaccine deals across the globe. In June 2021, they signed one of their biggest contracts to date \u2014 with the Philippine government for 40 million doses.\n\nMeanwhile, COVID-19 \u201cbreakthrough cases,\u201d which used to be called vaccine failures, are on the rise. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of July 19, 5,914 people who had been fully vaccinated for COVID-19 were hospitalized or died from COVID-19.\n\nIn the U.K., as of July 15, 87.5% of the adult population had received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 67.1% had received two. Yet, symptomatic cases among partially and fully vaccinated are on the rise, with an average of 15,537 new infections a day being detected, a 40% increase from the week before.\n\nIn a July 19 report from the CDC, the agency also reported that the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had received 12,313 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 more than doubling from the 6,079 reports of death from the week before.\n\nSoon after the report, however, they reverted the number to the 6,079 from the week before, indicating by default that no deaths from the vaccine had occurred that week,34 raising serious questions about transparency and vaccine safety.\n\nMany other adverse events are also appearing, ranging from risks from the biologically active SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used in the vaccine to blood clots, reproductive toxicity and myocarditis(heart inflammation). As you can see in the confidential indemnification agreements, however, even if the vaccine turns out to be a dismal failure \u2014 and a risk to short- and long-term health \u2014 countries have no recourse, nor does anyone who received the experimental shots.\n\nOne question that we should all be asking is this: If the COVID-19 vaccines are, in fact, as safe and effective as the manufacturers claim, why do they require this level of indemnification?\n\nYou can actually participate in the global efforts to cripple the Deep State organized criminal cabal's ability for genocide, while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same time, by boycotting Big Pharma for good.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Leaked Document Reveals \u2018Shocking\u2019 Terms of Pfizer\u2019s International Vaccine Agreements", "url": "https://geopolitics.co/2021/08/11/leaked-document-reveals-shocking-terms-of-pfizers-international-vaccine-agreements/", "description": "Vaccine purchasers must \u201cindemnify, defend and hold harmless Pfizer \u2026 from and against any and all suits, claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, penalties, fines, cost\u2026", "article:published_time": "2021-08-11T06:12:23+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-15T09:46:36+00:00", "site_name": "Covert Geopolitics", "image": "https://geopolitics.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pfizer-executives.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "506", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["pfizer vaccines", "no liability clause", "pfizer purchase agreement", "pfizer deaths"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"474\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PFIZERLEAK: EXPOSING THE PFIZER MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT.<br/><br/>(thread)<br/><br/>Background:<br/>Pfizer has been extremely aggressive in trying to protect the details of their international COVID19 vaccine agreements.<br/><br/>Luckily, I've managed to get one.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PfizerLeak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PfizerLeak</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pfizer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Pfizer</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1JlyJzxByb\">pic.twitter.com/1JlyJzxByb</a></p>\u2014 Ehden @ TELEGRAM CHANNEL: T.ME/EH_DEN (@eh_den) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eh_den/status/1419653002818990085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 26, 2021</a></blockquote> \n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"474\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The CDC revised downward its official number of deaths reported to VAERS following COVID vaccines, but an analysis of VAERS data shows the CDC arrived at the new, lower number, by excluding reports of deaths from outside the U.S.<a href=\"https://t.co/HA2n8lkuMw\">https://t.co/HA2n8lkuMw</a></p>\u2014 Robert F.
