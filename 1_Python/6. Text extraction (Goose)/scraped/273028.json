I\u2019m okay with some heated exchanges and some disagreements, particularly in this case because this guy has done a ton of interviews on this book and the topics we clash over most people will find surprising\u2026 particularly that he has such a strong favorable opinion about scientism, and materialistic science-as-we-know-it.\n\nThe other thing is, he\u2019s really closed down re conspiracies. He doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve in conspiracies,\u201d whatever that means. I wanted to bring this up because it\u2019s such a litmus test. If you don\u2019t \u201cbelieve in conspiracies\u201d you are on the outside of our culture looking in because conspiracies are at the heart of culture shaping. They\u2019re at the heart of politics, they\u2019re at the heart of money, they\u2019re, unfortunately, at the heart of corporate science \u2014 they\u2019re at the heart of everything important to our culture. So, to say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in conspiracies,\u201d and at the same time to say, \u201cI believe in magick,\u201d is\u2026 well, I wish I could have gotten there earlier in the interview \ud83d\ude42\n\nBut, I think it\u2019s important, I think it\u2019s important to understand that and bring that forward, especially from a guy who\u2019s made such a splash with this book.\n\nSo, here then is my interview with Jason Louv.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let\u2019s start with the book, your publisher was nice enough to introduce me, so we are hereby obligated to talk about this really rather remarkable new book, it\u2019s getting a lot of attention, as well it should, it\u2019s really pretty fantastic. What I want to focus on here, tell people about the book, they should go out and get the book, even though we\u2019re not going to spend a lot of time in this interview talking about it, they should get it. Talk about what I\u2019ve underlined there, the occult and this empire architecture that is John Dee and why he is relevant to anyone, whether they\u2019re super interested in magic or not.\n\nJason Louv: Okay. So, the book is called John Dee and the Empire of Angels and it\u2019s a history and a biographical take on Dr. John Dee, who was Queen Elizabeth 1 court astrologer and scientific advisor. He was a real-life magician, he was interested in magic and not just for silly things like fortune telling, but very directly to get the British Empire going. He was the guy who coined the phrase \u2018British Empire\u2019, he is the person responsible for laying out the naval schematics, made it possible to create, among many, many other scientific and mathematical achievements. He\u2019s the person that brought higher mathematics to the British public for the first time and he also spent about ten plus years doing occult rituals none stop, to talk to angels to try and learn the higher wisdom of humanity. Believe that or not, his work has had a tremendous impact on history, although it\u2019s been kept secret and occulted.\n\nSo, what that means is, this book is not just about the singular individual but it\u2019s about the secret history of the last 500 years of the world and about the occult forces that have been quietly, incredibly, forcefully shaping world history and what that really means is, this is the guy to what reality actually is and helps you, potentially, realign yourself to it and maybe you yourself might have to learn a bit of magic, just to get your way out of the nightmare of history.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay, but he\u2019s also a complicated guy, as you\u2026 you\u2019re very fair-minded, I think, in the book. I mean, in some respects he\u2019s a broken man, he\u2019s not a perfect man. T\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s important is, he\u2019s a Christian. A lot of people will come across John Dee and will immediately dive into the magic and the wife swapping and the crazy kind of stuff, and then, this guy is a devout Christian, he is as Christian as he can be. Even when he\u2019s doing his magic he\u2019s praying intensely and intently to Jesus for protection and for guidance and all of this stuff, but in the end, he also has this other side. He is a somewhat broken man and then there\u2019s the question of, is he being manipulated somehow?\n\nThese are some of the deeper questions, but the kind of stuff I did want to get into. So, let\u2019s do that now, what do you think?\n\nJason Louv: Well, I push back on that a little bit, in the sense that Dee certainly had some misadventures, he had ups and downs, but the reality of John Dee is that he was a government servant, he was not a well-paid one, but we have to put that in context. Nobody was well paid at this time. Sir Francis spent his entire life in debt, but he wasn\u2019t unique in that. Sir Francis Walsingham, who started the British Intelligence Agencies at this time also, also spent his life in debt. England was broke at this time, which Dee actually fixed by giving them the plans for building an empire and colonizing the new world.\n\nAlso, we have to put that in context and the reason that\u2019s important is, so often people will point to stories of guys like John Dee or [0:06:19] and say, \u201cOh well, they died broke, they died destitute, that proves that there\u2019s something sinister about magic and you shouldn\u2019t mess with it.\u201d Well, the reality is that John Dee rose to as higher of a position as he could have, given the economics of the time, given his class background.\n\nLook, it was the 1500s, life was hard. People were dying of plague, people were starving to death, nobody\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m referring to, what I\u2019m referring to, and as you reveal in the book\u2026 I\u2019m not putting the guy down because in one sense he is the ultimate spiritual seeker, truth seeker warrior, but the point where he almost reaches the point of suicide I think is telling. It\u2019s telling in a couple of ways. One, he reaches it because his spiritual journey he feels will not be fulfilled. Well, there\u2019s two ways to read that, one is to admire the, kind of intense interest and desire he has to achieve this spiritual fulfillment, but the other is, what\u2019s going on in the psyche of this guy, that he\u2019s going to commit suicide? What goes on in the psyche of him when he pairs with Kelley, who was not\u2026\n\nSo, he is a complicated figure, maybe you don\u2019t want to put broken on it, but I\u2019m not talking about it in any other way than just from the truth seeker, spiritual warrior part. He had a tough go of it.\n\nJason Louv: My take on magic, and when I say magic, I use magic as a catch-all term for a lot of different spiritual paths, but specifically for the Western esoteric tradition. The point of the Western esoteric tradition is as I said, the raising of the entire individual along the vertical axis, so becoming a more enlightened, empowered and awake individual. That\u2019s the safe way to do it. Conjuring spirits is the unsafe way to do it, by and large.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that to put down different traditions and religions that rely very strongly upon spirit contact, but that\u2019s not my interest in magic and it\u2019s not what I teach.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, I can accept that that\u2019s not what you teach or that that\u2019s not what your interest is, my problem is differentiating between the map and the territory. You can say that that\u2019s not your map, that\u2019s not how you\u2019re doing it, your map is personal empowerment or however you say it. The point is, is there a spiritual realm and does that spiritual realm have impact on our material realm? That is fundamentally the question that I think we wrestle with and we don\u2019t wrestle to the ground and we really need to wrestle to the ground as even just a basic starting point.\n\nThe screen that I\u2019ve put up here, it says, \u2018reality\u2019. This show is 90% about the fact that the absurdity that we live in a scientific reality that completely disavows, not only disavows, just doesn\u2019t acknowledge anything beyond materialistic, dogmatic kind of science, right?\n\nSo, there is no room for magic, there\u2019s no room for religion, there\u2019s no room for anything beyond that materialism that we\u2019re enmeshed in, and the absurdity is that no one really believes that. No one believes that they\u2019re a biological robot in a meaningless universe. \u201cWe believe that we are able to connect with other people, that we have love, that we have meaning in our life, and yet we walk out kids to school and let them go into science class and science class tells them, \u201cNo. You are a biological robot and the universe is meaningless.\u201d\n\nSo, the first challenge, before we even get into any of that sorcery or evocation of spirits or any of that, is to understand the difference between this bracket of reality, of science and spirituality, if you will, in its broader sense, in terms of there being more than just a material world. Are we on the same page there or not?\n\nJason Louv: I can tell you my take on it, which is that when I approach these things, first off, I do not put science and magic in opposition to each other. I think that\u2019s a false dichotomy, and to be more specific about that, I think that science is the crowning achievement of humanity. I think it\u2019s the greatest tool we\u2019ve ever come up with, in order to light a light in the darkness, to light a light in the demon haunted world, as Carl Sagan once called it. I think that in this book, I really clearly shine a light on the work of people who were magicians and alchemists, like John Dee and Giordano Bruno and Isaac Newton and Francis Bacon and people like that, to create science magically. Science was a creation of the magical tradition and it\u2019s a brilliant creation.\n\nNow, when I talk about magic, I\u2019m very careful to separate these things because the last thing that I want is for the scientific paradigm to collapse. Right now, in America, we\u2019re seeing the catastrophic consequences of people not being able to know what\u2019s true anymore and the whole thing of fake news and things that are going on politically. We\u2019re really on the verge of going back to the Dark Ages.\n\nSo, I\u2019m very careful, even though I talk about magic, not to put up this kind of woolly 1970s, In Search of\u2026 with Leonard Nimoy, type of opposition between science and magic. Now that\u2019s said, how are they different?\n\nThe way that I look at it is that science tells us the objective truths about what reality actually is, it\u2019s a brilliant tool. Magic is about the realm of subjectivity, it\u2019s the realm of how humans create meaning out of their experience.\n\nNow, are there \u2018spirits\u2019? Is there a spiritual reality? There are absolutely things that people have perceived as spirits throughout all human history that have appeared to have shaped history and certainly shaped people\u2019s lives on a day-to-day basis. The broader question is, is there any objective reality to that or is that just an aspect of people\u2019s minds? Perhaps a shared aspect of people\u2019s minds, like a collective unconscious perhaps, to use an overused and a much-abused term. That\u2019s the real question, what is that?\n\nThe question of whether people interact with them and whether these things play a gigantic role in people\u2019s lives, that\u2019s a [unclear 00:13:03] point, because that\u2019s the truth, that\u2019s what life on this planet is. Most cultures outside of Western culture, interact with these realities on a daily basis, whether that\u2019s South America, Africa, India, Buddhist cultures, Thailand, even Christian groups for the most part are immersed constantly in a spiritual realm.\n\nNow, my previous answer, when I was saying the point of the way that I teach magic is that it\u2019s about enlightenment is that, for me, that was a magical answer. As somebody who\u2019s interested in yoga and meditation, all of that is an intermediary layer, the part where people get obsessed with sorcery and spirits and powers and psychic phenomenon and all that stuff, people often call that the astral plane and for me that\u2019s an intermediary stage, that\u2019s something to get passed.\n\nWhat I\u2019m interested in is enlightenment states, and to get to that, you have to get beyond that layer of whatever it is, that hallucinatory layer, because what\u2019s happens is, people get into meditation and magic is they get to unlock that hallucinatory layer and it becomes endlessly fascinating, just like TV would be, but ultimately it\u2019s a distraction at the end of the day, and that\u2019s another place where I have to distinguish what I\u2019m teaching from a lot of other current approaches to magic. Are there spirits? Can you summon them? Yes. Can you do astral travel and all of these things like this? Yes. Is it an intermediary stage? In my opinion, yeah.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: So, here\u2019s the hard part Jason. I totally agree with you in the end gain. I\u2019m a yogi, right? So, that\u2019s my orientation.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Forget that. My problem with the magical community\u2026\n\nJason Louv: It\u2019s kind of important, but okay.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, it\u2019s important to me, right? It\u2019s not important to this conversation right now.\n\nJason Louv: The reason I say it\u2019s important is because I\u2019m trying to tell what your focus is, what you\u2019re focusing on with your practice.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What I\u2019m focusing on right now is, I don\u2019t understand how you are fully embracing materialistic science and not drawing\u2026 I don\u2019t get that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Because science has systematically and quite intentionally tried to deny all of the aspects of the greater self that you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s not an accident. It\u2019s not this miracle of science, kind of thing. It\u2019s part of that, but it\u2019s also culture shaping, in terms of telling us that, \u201cYou are not more, you are just a biological robot. Go out and shop. Satisfy your physical desires because that\u2019s all you are.\u201d\n\nJason Louv: Science doesn\u2019t say, \u201cGo out and shop.\u201d That\u2019s consumerism and advertising.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: How do you understand the distinction between scientific materialism and the consumeristic materialism? Where do you think that line is drawn philosophically?\n\nJason Louv: Well, those are two totally different things.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, they\u2019re not totally different things.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: They\u2019re exactly the same.\n\nJason Louv: No, no, no. You\u2019re over-generalizing, with all due respect. You\u2019re conflating a lot of different things. So, let\u2019s back up to the beginning.\n\nFirst of all, with scientific materialism. To paint the entirety of hundreds of years of science with one brush and say that it has a unified dogma, is just inaccurate.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What unified dogma are you talking about?\n\nJason Louv: Well, what you just said. Exactly what you just said.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hold on, I\u2019m just saying, materialistic science, by definition, says that science is matter and that we can measure what is going on and what we experience, right? Isn\u2019t that fundamentally what we call materialistic science? Isn\u2019t that the definition?\n\nJason Louv: That\u2019s one general part of thinking of science, but science evolves, science evolves constantly. One thing that I\u2019ve shown in John Dee and the Empire of Angels is, if you go back to the beginnings of science and people like John Dee and Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton, those things were never separate and increasingly now they\u2019re not separate. We see people like Rupert Sheldrake or Dean Radin, you mention, people who are looking at these things very seriously.\n\nBut science is not a dogma, science is simply a set of techniques and to discard it, well, that\u2019s absolutely true, I\u2019m sorry, to discard it would be like going back to the Dark Ages. You\u2019re alive right now because you\u2019ve had access to penicillin, you\u2019ve had access to drugs and things that have been produced by science that have given you\u2026We\u2019re talking on this computer, all of these things have been given to us, and I really don\u2019t draw a distinction. Science is an amazing tool, humanity has created many, many different wonderful tools, why would we refuse to use them? If you want to go back and live in a cave in the 12th century, go right ahead, but you seem not to be doing that because we\u2019re having a conversation on Zoom. So, you must like science a bit, you\u2019re certainly benefiting from it.\n\nNow, in terms of whether science denies certain parts of the spiritual realm? I have two answers to that. One answer is, that\u2019s good to a large extent. When you look at certain parts in this world where people are still immersed in fear, fear of people having magical power over them, that\u2019s no good, but also, everything is a process, everything is a process of change. Science has been a very important period for human consciousness to evolve through.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Human consciousness? How does science, as we know it, modern science understand human consciousness?\n\nJason Louv: Well, it doesn\u2019t fully, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t have the answer, and that\u2019s where you get people like me coming along.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What is the current position of science on human consciousness? That it\u2019s epiphenomena of the brain. That is it. Plain and simple.\n\nJason Louv: I think that\u2019s evolving quite a bit. I\u2019ve done quite a bit of work on artificial intelligence\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. You can say it\u2019s evolving, but it\u2019s evolving from the position that\u2019s clearly not true.\n\nJason Louv: I\u2019ve agreed to this interview so please, at least let me finish my answers.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: It\u2019s a conversation, so we can talk.\n\nJason Louv: Okay, so let\u2019s talk one at a time, and I\u2019ll be respectful.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You interrupted me but go ahead.\n\nJason Louv: Okay, okay, I won\u2019t. Alright, so I\u2019ve done a lot of work on artificial intelligence. Science doesn\u2019t have an answer for\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I was in the PhD program on artificial intelligence in this year\u2019s [unclear 00:19:38]. I know all about it. Go ahead.\n\nJason Louv: So, they don\u2019t fully know, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not an answer. They\u2019re trying to reduce consciousness to an algorithm. Personally, I don\u2019t think they actually will.\n\nI want to make it very clear that I\u2019m not saying that science has the ultimate answers, what I\u2019m saying is that science is a process. It\u2019s very hard to define because the very point of science is that hypothesis is made and then tested and that\u2019s an ongoing process and things are overturned. We don\u2019t fully know and certainly in my work, what I\u2019m trying to do is bring interest to things like meditation and spirituality and I want people to look at them. I particularly want scientists to look at them in an empirical and methodical way, so that we can look at those parts of the human experience and bring back things that can be helpful to our further evolution as a species, particularly because technology is advancing so quickly, we haven\u2019t been able to catch up with it on the wisdom front.\n\nSo again, everything\u2019s a tool. I look at things magically in the sense that everything\u2019s a tool, and I think we should use all of it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah, I just think we have to nail some things down. So, when you say consciousness\u2026 I talk to these folks all the time, some of the leading researchers on consciousness, both on the materialistic side and more of the cutting-edge side. You know Dean Radin\u2019s been on this show many times, Rupert Sheldrake has been on this show many times, as has Christof Koch, one of the leading researchers, or, who\u2019s the guy? Hameroff, the guy who\u2019s\u2026\n\nSo, I\u2019m familiar with this. I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re really fairly representing the struggle between this materialistic definition of consciousness that is an epiphenomenon of the brain and how science, as we know it, has just vehemently denied, even considering all of the data that contradicts that, all of the data from near-death experience science. Even going back to quantum physics. Quantum physics really puts a wrench in the whole idea of this consciousness being an epiphenomenon of the brain. This is a huge dilemma, not only a dilemma for science but it\u2019s a huge stumbling block for science.\n\nSo, you don\u2019t have to tell me science is a method, it\u2019s not a position statement. Of course, we all get that, but the reality is, the way science operates inside our society, the way it works in terms of shaping policy, the way it works in terms of shaping culture, it\u2019s really important that we understand these.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t understand the cheerleading for science as we know it. I guess I\u2019m more of an iconoclast, but I think there has to be, for us to move forward, I think it\u2019s really important that we have some fundamental reality check on just what consciousness is and how much our current understanding of consciousness goes against what is accepted widely, throughout academia, as being human consciousness. So, do you understand my frustration?\n\nJason Louv: Well, I think this is hilarious, because now you\u2019ve got the magic guy arguing for science on a podcast called Skeptiko!\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I know. What\u2019s going on?\n\nJason Louv: Well look, here\u2019s the thing. Okay, is there a friction between science\u2019s current definition of consciousness and what mystics have been telling us for a long period of time? Yes. Is science, to a large degree, run by defense and military contracting? Yes. Is that a problem? Yes. But, what I don\u2019t want to do is make a monolithic statement for all science, as if all science can be represented with one statement because that\u2019s simply not true. There are scientists all over the world working on all different projects and to speak that there\u2019s one monolithic scientific establishment is simply not true, that\u2019s just sloppy thinking.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Of course not, but it\u2019s sloppy thinking to say it the other way too.\n\nJason Louv: No, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not. What I\u2019m saying is, science is\u2026 Okay. What we\u2019re doing, in general, as a culture, is we\u2019re increasing our knowledge and science is one of our tools to do that. Mysticism is another. To go backwards to reject science and to go backwards would be a tremendous civilizational wide disaster and we see the consequence of that type of thinking in our world right now, with people accepting conspiracy theories, fake news, antivaccination stuff, it\u2019s an utter nightmare. All you have to do is go on Facebook.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to make any difference, it\u2019s like you said, I don\u2019t understand how a magic guy gets in\u2026 You\u2019re a non-conspiratorial, so, were I was going to down is the conspiratorial path. You don\u2019t want to hear that but to suggest that the government control mechanism, CIA, deep state, however you want to put it, hasn\u2019t had a vested interest in steering consciousness in a certain way, in terms of steering academia towards this materialistic science that denies a larger, broader extended consciousness, while at the same time, they were investigating and figuring out how to weaponize consciousness, I think is incredibly na\u00efve and I don\u2019t see it in your world view at all.\n\nJason Louv: Well, that\u2019s because I don\u2019t agree with it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You don\u2019t agree with it?\n\nJason Louv: Well, let me ask you this. If that\u2019s true, then why hasn\u2019t\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You don\u2019t believe history then?\n\nJason Louv: I don\u2019t know. If that\u2019s true, then why has the Trump administration been defunding science and denying science left and right? If anything, the people in power want to deny climate science.\n\nJason Louv: No, no, no, back up. Here\u2019s my position. Science is the greatest light that humanity has ever created. You asked me, how can a magic person say that? I\u2019m a human being and I can\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I didn\u2019t ask you that question.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I didn\u2019t ask you that question.\n\nJason Louv: You just did, you just did.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You\u2019re answering a question that I didn\u2019t ask. I didn\u2019t ask.\n\nJason Louv: Guy, please. You\u2019re interviewing me, let me speak.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Go back and review the thing. You\u2019ve interrupted me like a million times, so now you can\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Do you believe in climate change?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Do you think that climate change is supported by the science?\n\nJason Louv: Listen to me. Listen to me.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Do you think science supports climate change?\n\nJason Louv: Yes, 99.7% of all NASA scientists\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s the most fake figure in the world. You are\u2026\n\nJason Louv: You\u2019re an idiot. You\u2019re an idiot. You\u2019re an idiot. You\u2019re an idiot. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nJason Louv: I\u2019m sorry, you don\u2019t believe in climate science? NASA, go to a NASA website. This is what is driving our world back to the Dark Ages, this type of thinking, this type of thinking. Conspiratorial. If that was actually true, the government would be funding all of this science, but they\u2019re actually tearing it apart and what\u2019s happening is the world is sliding backwards into ignorance of the type that you\u2019re displaying.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Because of the facts or global warming?\n\nJason Louv: Look, if you\u2019re going to be an individual who wants to liberate humanity, you will use every tool possible.\n\nRobert Anton Wilson, one of my heroes, thought that you should be able to wear every hat possible, whether that\u2019s magic or science or consciousness and you should be able to go back and forth between then as much as possible. With people like you, I push science, with people who are hard science people, I push consciousness, but right now, you\u2019re just telling me things that are not true and you\u2019re being very combative about it and I\u2019m being combative back because I\u2019m pushing back against statements which are just simply not true.\n\nThis is important, because we live in a post-truth world, which actually means a world full of lies and delusions, misinformation and un-education.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Have you ever read the study that cited on the NASA website and that was cited by Obama, the 97% consensus? Have you ever read the study, do you know the methodology that was used?\n\nJason Louv: You haven\u2019t even said the name of the study.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, it\u2019s the same study that everybody references, I forget the guy\u2019s name, but do you know\u2026?\n\nJason Louv: You haven\u2019t told me what the study is or even what it says.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it says, but the methodology, which everyone assumes is that they went out and they pooled scientists and they asked them what their view on global warming is, but that\u2019s not the methodology that they used. What they did is they hired a bunch of grad students to serve as science abstracts and then they made a judgement call on whether those abstracts were supportive or non-supportive of their understanding of what global warming was. It was flawed from the beginning and then, in particular, many, many scientists came forward, who were cited in that study and said, \u201cHey, my paper said the exact opposite of that and yet I was put in this category.\u201d\n\nSo, if you want to go and look at the work of people like, oh what\u2019s her name at Georgia Tech? I can\u2019t think of her name right now, I\u2019m happy to send that to you, bit many people have pulled that apart, it\u2019s just a ridiculous study. It\u2019s a pure example of\u2026\n\nJason Louv: Honestly, I\u2019m going to trust the NASA website and the scientific consensus on this. It\u2019s really non-negotiable, and then somebody being an idiot in this conversation, and frankly I feel like I\u2019m in the content section of a Facebook discussion.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I can pull up that study if you want, if you want to look at it. I can send it to you afterwards.\n\nJason Louv: Yes, send it to me. We\u2019re out of time, but please, go ahead and send it to me. The reality of climate change is not\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019d love to hear your take on vaccines.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But the name calling Jason, the name calling.\n\nJason Louv: Guy, guy, guy, guy. Look, the liberty of human consciousness is at stake right now.\n\nJason Louv: Humanity going back to the Dark Ages for opinions like this. That\u2019s my point. Anybody who is listening to this conversation, I highly recommend, there\u2019s an audio series called, Your Deceptive Mind by Dr. Steven Novella, which will go through systematically\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Oh my gosh. Why didn\u2019t you say you were a Steve Novella fan at the beginning? We could have short circuited this whole thing.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019ve got three or four interviews with Steve Novella.\n\nSo, this interview has obviously been a train wreck and I\u2019ve held off from jumping in and making any comments, but I did have to jump in here because inside baseball can only go so far, and we were talking about Steve Novella and I realized a lot of people might not know who Dr. Steven Novella is. Who he is, is a Yale University Neurologist and one of the best-known public skeptics. I mean, hardcore skeptic. He does this show, The Skeptics\u2019 Guide to the Universe and everything to this guy is, you know, what they call woo, to these hardcore skeptics is woo. \u201cSpirits? Total woo.\u201d I mean, it isn\u2019t at all within his belief system. Occult, magic, heck, this guy doesn\u2019t believe in free will, he doesn\u2019t believe in consciousness. I always say, the biological robot, meaningless universe, his worldview demands that everything about your minute by minute experience of consciousness is purely the product of your brain, therefore there is no such thing as meaning, there is no such thing as love, connection, all of that stuff. He doesn\u2019t even believe in parapsychology. The debates that I\u2019ve had with him have been about, like Dean Radin\u2019s carefully controlled, multiply replicated, presentiment work, completely denies it, completely misrepresents it and then says that Dean Radin fiddles with the data. The worst of the worst, in terms of hardcore skeptics and this is, I mean, it makes no sense to me. Jason, it\u2019s the self-loathing thing, like \u201cLet\u2019s cozy up with these people that completely hate and stand against everything we\u2019re about. Man, I don\u2019t get that.\n\nGo back and listen to my interviews with him, I think he doesn\u2019t hold up very well, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve held up very well either.\n\nJason Louv: I own this stuff. Well, you\u2019ve just been a laughing monkey.\n\nJason Louv: The light of science, intelligence, let there be life. [Unclear 00:32:52], as both the scientists and the alchemists have said. Humanity must be liberated from superstition by knowledge, whether that\u2019s knowledge of the\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What does Novella think of your\u2026?\n\nJason Louv: Well, he would totally discount it, but I\u2019d love to talk about it with him, but like I said, I\u2019m willing to shift hats. If I\u2019m having this conversation I can wear the skeptic hat. On Skeptiko, I\u2019ve out-skepticed the Skeptiko podcast.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, you don\u2019t understand what Skeptiko is about. I encourage you to get Novella on your show, that\u2019s one I would listen to. That\u2019s one I would listen to, because I\u2019ve spoken with him, you haven\u2019t.\n\nJason Louv: I will see whether he would come on the show.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019ve spoken with him. I\u2019ve faced-off with him several times, you haven\u2019t.\n\nJason Louv: Well, I\u2019m sure that went great. I\u2019m sure that went great. I\u2019m sure he loved you.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hey, I think we had a mutual respect, that\u2019s why we did multiple shows, but that\u2019s okay. You know what? A lot was revealed, I always learn something. Thanks for coming on.\n\nJason Louv: Alright.
