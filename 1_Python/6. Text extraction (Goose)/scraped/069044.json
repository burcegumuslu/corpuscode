Posted in Latest news\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 global communications rep tells the WEF, \u201cWe own the science, and we think that the world should know it, and the platforms themselves also do,\u201d during a panel on disinformation.\n\nDuring the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) Sustainable Development Impact Meetings last week, the unelected globalists held a panel on \u201cTackling Disinformation\u201d where participants from the UN, CNN, and Brown University discussed how to best control narratives. [bold, links added]\n\nMelissa Fleming, [pictured above, right] Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications at the United Nations, highlighted that the UN had partnered with several big tech companies, including TikTok and Google, to control COVID and climate narratives while claiming, \u201cWe own the science.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of controlling the climate change narrative, Fleming remarked that the UN had partnered with Google so that the unelected globalists\u2019 authoritative narratives would appear at the top of search results.\n\n\u201cWe partnered with Google,\u201d said Fleming, adding, \u201cfor example, if you Google \u2018climate change,\u2019 you will, at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources.\n\n\u201cWe started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled \u2018climate change,\u2019 we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re becoming much more proactive. We own the science, and we think that the world should know it, and the platforms themselves also do,\u201d she added.\n\nBut the unelected globalists\u2019 efforts on narrative control didn\u2019t end with partnering with Google to manipulate search results on climate change.\n\nFleming also highlighted that the UN worked with TikTok on the \u201cTeam Halo\u201d project to boost COVID messaging from medical and scientific communities on the Chinese-owned video sharing platform.\n\n\u201cWe had another trusted messenger project, which was called \u2018Team Halo\u2019 where we trained scientists around the world and some doctors on TikTok, and we had TikTok working with us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe UN claims to own the science, but if we take a closer look at who funds the UN\u2019s \u201cdirecting and coordinating authority on international health\u201d \u2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2014 we get a clearer picture of who is really calling the shots.\n\nHistorically, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with the Gates-backed GAVI vaccine alliance, have contributed more to the WHO program budget than all member nations, save two \u2014 the US and the UK.\n\nWho owns the science again?\n\nDuring last week\u2019s WEF panel, the UN global communications rep went on to admit that people didn\u2019t trust institutions like the UN when it came to information related to COVID, and so to counter this, the UN looked to influencers to get its message across through the backdoor.\n\n\u201cAnother really key strategy we had was to deploy influencers,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cinfluencers who were really keen, who have huge followings, but really keen to help carry messages that were going to serve their communities, and they were much more trusted than the United Nations telling them something from New York City headquarters.\u201d\n\nThe idea of infiltrating and subverting online groups from within by targeting influencers mirrors recommendations from a Google-backed RAND report published in April 2021.\n\nAccording to the report\u2019s policy recommendations:\n\n\u201cConspiracists have their own experts on whom they lean to support and strengthen their views, and their reliance on these experts might limit the impact of formal outreach by public health professionals.\n\n\u201cOur review of the literature shows that one alternative approach could be to direct outreach toward moderate members of those groups who could, in turn, exert influence on the broader community.\u201d\n\nThe report went on to say, \u201cCommercial marketing programs use a similar approach when they engage social media influencers (or brand ambassadors), who can then credibly communicate advantages of a commercial brand to their own audiences on social media.\u201d\n\nModerating last week\u2019s \u201cTackling Disinformation\u201d panel was WEF managing director Adrian Monck, who in recent months has been name-calling critics of the WEF and components of its Great Reset agenda as white supremacists and anti-Semites engaged in far-right disinformation campaigns.\n\nWhen addressing CNN\u2019s Rachel Smolkin, Monck said that CNN was part of a political war strategy to \u201cown the narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cCNN is both an organization that\u2019s trying to make sense of the world and trying to establish the facts; it\u2019s also part of a political war on who owns the narrative,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to MintPress News, CNN received $3.6 million in donations from none other than the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 the same organization that\u2019s been heavily invested in the WHO.\n\nThe investigation revealed that Gates had also donated a whopping $319 million to many of the biggest and most influential corporate news outlets in the world.\n\nWho\u2019s really engaged in the \u201cpolitical war on who owns the narrative\u201d again?\n\nSpeaking of owning narratives, last year the WEF launched the Great Narrative initiative as a sequel to the Great Reset, with the goal of reshaping all aspects of society and the global economy.\n\nThe idea of a great narrative is something that the French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard called a \u201cgrand narrative,\u201d (aka \u201cmetanarrative\u201c) which, according to Philo-Notes, \u201cfunctions to legitimize power, authority, and social customs\u201d \u2014 everything that the great reset is trying to achieve.\n\nOnce the Great Reset has its great narrative implemented, any opposing narrative can be dismissed as disinformation, conspiracy, or extremism that must be censored and suppressed for the greater, collective good.\n\nIn one WEF panel on \u201cTackling Disinformation,\u201d we saw unelected globalists claim that they basically had a monopoly on science and that corporate media was embroiled in a battle to own the narrative.\n\nAt the same time, the UN rep claimed that people who questioned the vaccine narrative were \u201cseizing the opportunity of people being afraid\u201d to inject disinformation.\n\nAccording to Fleming, \u201cPeople who are very active in the anti-vaccine scene and others were seizing the opportunity of people being so afraid \u2014 injecting disinformation and misleading information \u2014 fueled also by some leaders and governments.\u201d\n\nHowever, it was Britain\u2019s King Charles III, who was a prince at the time of the great reset launch, who said in June 2020,\n\nSimilarly, WEF founder Klaus Schwab said that the pandemic represented \u201ca rare but narrow window of opportunity\u201d to initiate the Great Reset agenda.\n\nIf anyone was \u201cseizing the opportunity\u201d to exploit people\u2019s fears during the pandemic, unelected globalists and the British crown would certainly be at the top of that list.\n\nOn the subject of free speech, Brown University\u2019s Claire Wardle, who is \u201cone of the world\u2019s leading experts on misinformation,\u201d told last week\u2019s WEF disinformation panel that she was frustrated that people couldn\u2019t have a \u201cmore nuanced conversation about speech\u201d as she simultaneously engaged in a nuanced conversation about free speech.\n\nFree speech is free speech. It allows for nuanced conversation by default.\n\nHowever, that didn\u2019t stop Wardle from complaining about free speech even as she was actively participating in it in real time.\n\n\u201cI just wish we could have a more nuanced conversation about speech,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis idea that all speech is equal is not true, and I wish we could just have that conversation properly,\u201d Wardle added, as she had exactly that type of conversation.\n\nBy declaring they \u201cown the science,\u201d partnering with big tech companies to manipulate search results to influence public opinion, and pouring millions of dollars into media outlets, the unelected globalists are once again showing their true colors for all to see.\n\nOwning the science leads to owning the narrative.\n\nControlling thought and speech means the end of a free society.\n\nWelcome to the great reset.\n\nThe unelected globalists\u2019 authoritarian attempts to remake society out of the destruction of the old are becoming increasingly more obvious and desperate as the people\u2019s trust in the global elites continues to crumble.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article",
