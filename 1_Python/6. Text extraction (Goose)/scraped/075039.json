The latest reports stated that over 88 percent of the country is fully vaccinated, and around 40 percent had received booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. It also leads the world in doses administered with nearly 3.2 billion doses given.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 15, the country reported a record high of 5,000 new COVID-19 cases with the omicron variant, mostly in the northeastern province of Jilin. Following this, all 24 million residents of the province were placed under lockdown.\n\nThis is the first time the communist nation has placed an entire province under lockdown since early 2020, when Hubei province in central China, home to Wuhan, was shut down.\n\nIn Jilin, residents are banned from moving around outside. Anybody that wants to be given the right to leave the province must apply for a permit with the police.\n\nThe lockdown order in Jilin comes after the 17.5 million residents of the southern city of Shenzhen were placed under lockdown on Sunday, March 13, which led to the suspension of all public transport services, including buses and subways.\n\nShenzhen is also notable for being a manufacturing and shipping hub. The city alone accounts for around 11 percent of China\u2019s economy and the province of Guangdong, where the city is located, accounts for nearly a quarter of the country\u2019s shipping.\n\nSeveral other cities all over China were placed under lockdown, including Langfang, which borders Beijing to the south and east, and Dongguan in the southern province of Guangdong.\n\nBusinesses shuttered all over China due to tyrannical lockdowns\n\nBusinesses affected by the lockdowns all over the country were told to either shutter completely or have their employees work from home, with exceptions given to essential services like food production, utilities and other necessities. (Related: China stocks on a DOWNHILL trend as COVID cases rise.)\n\nThe mass closure of businesses all over the country has stoked fears in economic analysts that the ongoing supply chain crisis is about to get worse.\n\nTaiwanese electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn, which has a massive factory in Shenzhen that employs over 350,000 people, announced on Monday, March 14, its compliance with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) directive to shut down. Foxconn said it would resume production on the advice of the local government.\n\nThe Shenzhen factory manufactures all kinds of electronics, from Apple iPhones to Amazon Echo and Alexa devices to smart televisions and even vehicles. Disruptions to the production and export of goods coming out of this factory alone could be enough to induce shortages and further drive up inflation.\n\nToyota and Volkswagen, which have factories in the city of Changchun in Jilin, also both complied with CCP orders and completely halted production of their vehicles and components in the city.\n\nChang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg, warned that the \u201cforceful action\u201d the CCP is using to contain COVID-19 will result in a severe hit to the country\u2019s production and manufacturing output.\n\n\u201cPrevious steps to contain virus flare ups left manufacturing unscathed for the most part,\u201d said Chang. \u201cThis lockdown will hit output in key industries such as tech and machinery that feed into global supply chains.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that China is a major global manufacturing hub and one of the most important links in global supply chains, the country\u2019s COVID policy can have notable spillovers to its trading partners\u2019 activity and the global economy,\u201d said Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at financial company Scotiabank.\n\n\u201cThe outbreaks impose downside risk to China\u2019s economy at least in the next few months,\u201d noted Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist for Pinpoint Asset Management. \u201cA China slowdown would exacerbate the risk of stagflation and global supply chain problems.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the recent COVID outbreak in China at Pandemic.news.\n\nWatch this episode of \u201cBrighteon Conversations\u201d as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Yan Li-Meng about the threat China\u2019s biological warfare programs pose to the world.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nChina shuts down more ports due to \u201ccovid,\u201d global supply chain collapse imminent.\n\nChina implements strict lockdown, claiming they have to stop the spread of COVID\u2026 the supply chain will be impacted.\n\nForced covid lockdowns in China are starving people to death.", "opengraph": {"title": "World braces for renewed supply chain crisis as COVID outbreaks shut down highly vaccinated China", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2022-03-17-china-covid-outbreak-spurs-supply-chain-crisis.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "The supply chain crisis is expected to get worse\u00a0as\u00a0the resurgence of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in highly vaccinated China led to tens of millions being forced into some form of lockdown.
