Trump has tried to \u201cpoach\u201d German scientists working on a coronavirus vaccine so he could secure exclusive rights to it for the US. (1)\n\nAccording to the report, the German biotech company CureVac has been offered \u201clarge sums of cash\u201d by the Trump administration. Currently, CureVac is working with the federally-owned Paul Ehrlich Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Medicines (2) on a coronavirus vaccine like many other biotech laboratories around the globe.\n\nThe German government has responded by offering significant financial incentives to the company to remain in Germany. Senior German politician and professor of epidemiology Karl Lauterbach has commented on the report saying \u201cThe exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means. Capitalism has limits.\u201d\n\nCureVac themselves also commented saying that they have been in talks with multiple organizations and governments but that there are no plans for \u201cacquisitions\u201d. They also said that the firm \u201cabstains from commenting on speculations and rejects allegations about offers for the acquisition of the company or its technology.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, in a statement last week (3) the company confirmed that their CEO, Daniel Menichella has been invited to the White House for a meeting with Donald Trump to \u201cdiscuss strategies and opportunities for the production of a coronavirus vaccine.\u201d\n\nOther members of the German Health Ministry (4) have also commented on the situation saying:\n\n\u201cThe German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,\u201d the German newspaper quotes a Health Ministry spokesperson. \u201cIn this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac.\u201d\n\nOther German officials also confirmed the newspaper\u2019s report \u2013 \u201cWe confirm the report in the Welt am Sonntag,\u201d a representative said.\n\nIn a bit of good news, Florian von der Muelbe, cofounder and a chief production officer at CureVac has told Reuters last week (5) that the German company hopes they will be ready for human trials on a vaccine by June or July 2020. \u201cWe are very confident that we will be able to develop a potent vaccine candidate within a few months,\u201d Menichella said in a statement.\n\nThis optimistic timeframe of just a few months is in contrast with a statement by Anthony Fauci, the U.S. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who said that while he also expects human trials to begin in a few weeks, he expects the end product to be ready \u201cin 12 to 18 months\u201d (6).\n\nWith the U.S. stock market plummeting to a historic low for the past 3 decades (7) and Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating also taking a huge hit after his administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis (8), it\u2019s not surprising that the U.S. president is trying to take drastic steps to regain the favor of his voters.\n\nTrump was nearing a 50% approval rating \u2013 a personal high for him \u2013 until recently after his impeachment backfired and bolstered his support (9). This boded pretty well for him for the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election, however, the coronavirus crisis and stock market crash seem more and more likely to stop the president\u2019s rush to a second mandate.\n\nWhether his favorability would have increased with him \u201cpurchasing\u201d a foreign coronavirus vaccine exclusivity or not remains unclear. So far, the German biotech company seems to continue working with the support of the German government and not for a U.S. exclusivity.", "opengraph": {"description": "- The reputable German newspaper Welt am Sonntag (The World on Sunday) has reported that U.S. President Donald J.
