If you\u2019re thinking about using essential oils to treat your feline friend, there are very specific oils that are considered safe for cats, as well as certain potentially dangerous ones to avoid.\n\nThere are many uses of essential oils for cats, including geranium oil for reducing stress, frankincense oil for better digestion, & lavender oil for inducing calmness.\n\u2022 Stress: Geranium oil is known to reduce stress and regulate mood\n\u2022 Protect against insects: Use of catnip oil makes the cat happy and also protects it against insects. Lemongrass oil has a similar effect to catnip\n\nCats have several sets of scent glands, which are extremely sensitive, so it\u2019s important to apply very small amounts of these oils when using them on your cat. [1]\n\nThe recommended method of using essential oils on cats is through a diffuser or putting a small drop on their collar rather than directly on their skin. Topical application of this oil is not advised.\n\nAll oils, even the safe ones listed above, can be potentially toxic and should be stored carefully. However, these oils, in particular, should never be used on or around your cat.\n\nWord of Caution: Cats do not process oils in the same way as humans and are very susceptible to toxicity. Only use essential oils sparingly with your cat, and make sure that your cat has a way to leave the room when using a diffuser. If you are using the oils topically or internally, use the smallest amount possible. Dilute all oils well, and be sure to use pure brands that you trust.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Essential Oils for Cats: All You Need to Know | Organic Facts", "description": "There are many uses of essential oils for cats, including geranium oil for reducing stress, frankincense oil for better digestion, & lavender oil for inducing calmness.", "url": "https://www.organicfacts.net/essential-oils-cats.html", "site_name": "Organic Facts", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/organicfacts", "article:section": "Cat Care", "article:published_time": "2018-06-11T07:22:56-07:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-08-01T07:47:23-07:00", "updated_time": "2020-08-01T07:47:23-07:00", "image": "https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/essentialoilsforcats.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/essentialoilsforcats.jpg", "image:width": "700", "image:height": "525"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/essential-oil-benefits-uses.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/home-remedies/home-remedies-for-depression.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-geranium-essential-oil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-frankincense-essential-oil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-lavender-essential-oil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/geranium.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/frankincense.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/lavender.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-helichrysum-essential-oil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-cedar-wood-essential-oil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-catnip-essential-oil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-lemongrass-essential-oil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/catnip.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-rosemary-oil.html", "http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8197716", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/healthy-skin.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/basil.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/health-benefits-of-cloves.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/health-benefits-of-fennel.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/birch.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/oregano.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/peppermint.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/thyme.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/wintergreen.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/fruit/health-benefits-of-lemon.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/fruit/health-benefits-of-grapefruit.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/fruit/health-benefits-of-lime.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/bergamot.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-06-11T07:22:56-07:00"}
