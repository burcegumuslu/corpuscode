The study primarily investigated the safety and immunogenicity of boosters, but also looked into the infection and reactogenicity of the subjects.\n\nImmunogenicity, the focus of the study, is defined as the ability of the vaccine to trigger an immune response. Though the study authors reiterated that the trial does not examine vaccine efficacy, the authors acknowledged that immunogenicity has been used to infer efficacy.\n\nThree days before the FDA VRBPAC meeting on June 28, 2022, Moderna published the study as a preprint, and in September, published the study in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nBoth the preprint and peer-reviewed study included data on immunogenicity, safety, reactogenicity, as well as infection.\n\nModerna\u2019s spokesman Christopher Ridley also told CNN that the company shared the infection data with the FDA and published the study before the FDA panel meeting.\n\nAt the VRBPAC meeting, Moderna president Stephen Hoge made several references to the study\u2019s immunogenicity data, which showed that people who took the bivalent shots had a higher antibody level than those who took the monovalent booster, as an argument for the bivalent booster\u2019s superiority.\n\nHoge also made references to the same study\u2019s data on safety and reactogenicity, but infection rates were excluded.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s documents provided to the committee panel on the same day, also referenced the study\u2019s data on immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity, yet the infection data were similarly excluded.\n\nAccording to CNN, the FDA spokesman explained in an email that the data on infection were not included, as \u201cthe FDA received the preprint less than a day prior to the advisory committee meeting,\u201d and \u201cgenerally the FDA only discusses data at advisory committee meetings that the agency has had the opportunity to substantively review.\u201d\n\nThis means that the FDA could review the study\u2019s data on immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity, but had no opportunity to examine infection data.\n\nVRBPAC member and professor of microbiology and immunology from the University of Iowa, Dr. Stanley Perlman, said that with the absence of these data, there is always the concern that the public will lose trust in the health care system.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the VRBPAC committee ruled in favor of using the Omicron variant\u2019s mRNA in boosters to produce the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines in a 19-2 motion.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s meeting with members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Sep. 1, 2022, presented by Moderna staff Dr. Jacqueline Miller, also excluded data on infection rates in the presentation (pdf).\n\nHours into the CDC meeting, voting member of the ACIP Dr. Sybil Cineas asked whether there were any data on breakthrough infections between two experimental groups.\n\nMiller said that between the overall cohort of people who received the bivalent vaccine, the infection rate was 2.5 percent, and for the monovalent group, the rate of 2.4 percent.\n\nHowever, she failed to mention that for people who never had a previous infection, 3.2 percent of those who took the bivalent vaccine became infected, while 1.9 percent of subjects who took the monovalent developed an infection.\n\nThe ACIP members approved Moderna bivalent boosters being made available to people aged 18 and over in a 13-1 vote.\n\nDr. Cody Meissner, a VRBPAC member and a professor in the division of infectious diseases and international health from Dartmouth Health Children\u2019s, also pointed out that the infection data came out of a non-randomized and non-blinded study.\n\nThis introduces the risk of bias into the study, as those assigned to bivalent or monovalent boosters were not based on random chance, and trial administrators would know what booster participants received.\n\nWhile this possibly discounts the significance of the data on infection rates, it can also affect the validity of the findings on immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity.\n\nBiochemist and mRNA platform inventor Dr. Robert Malone raised the point that immunogenicity data that only look at antibody levels are not good surrogate measures for vaccine efficacy.\n\nAntibody levels are also not a good measure of immunity, as antibodies will and should wane with time. The long-term immunity they provide is therefore unknown.\n\nIt is also unconfirmed if the antibodies produced are neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus and spike proteins, or if they may actually prevent the immune system from killing and controlling the virus, a scenario known as antibody-dependent enhancement.\n\nBivalent boosters have come under increasing scrutiny for their rapidly declining effectiveness.\n\nA December 2022 preprint study on bivalent vaccines, authored by the Cleveland Clinic, found that the higher the number of previous vaccinations, the greater the risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\nIn a letter to the editor (pdf) published in the NEJM, researchers from Columbia University compared antibody serum responses among people who received bivalent boosters, monovalent boosters, and those who were infected.\n\nThe authors found that there was no significant difference in neutralizing abilities among these groups when tested against Omicron and other variants.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, an advisor on the VRBPAC committee who voted against bivalent boosters at the meeting, also published a commentary, saying that young and healthy people shouldn\u2019t get the latest boosters.\n\n\u201cI believe we should stop trying to prevent all symptomatic infections in healthy, young people by boosting them with vaccines containing mRNA from strains that might disappear a few months later,\u201d wrote Offit, also an FDA vaccine panel adviser and professor of pediatrics at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, in the NEJM on Jan. 11, 2023.\n\nIn his article, Offit cited two studies suggesting that bivalent boosters, which target the original COVID-19 strain and two Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA. 5, do not \u201celicit superior immune responses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did the strategy for significantly increasing BA.4 and BA.5 neutralizing antibodies using a bivalent vaccine fail?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe most likely explanation is imprinting. The immune systems of people immunized with the bivalent vaccine, all of whom had previously been vaccinated, were primed to respond to the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2. They therefore probably responded to epitopes shared by BA.4 and BA.5 and the ancestral strain, rather than to new epitopes on BA.4 and BA.5.\u201d\n\nMeissner, likewise, expressed that healthy people younger than 65 years of age may not need bivalent boosters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know \u2026 how many or how often boosters are necessary. And could there be consequences from giving multiple vaccine doses that we don\u2019t fully understand at this time?\u201d\n\nA peer-reviewed study published on Jan. 12 in Germany also showed that people who received higher numbers of mRNA vaccines had a higher IgG4 antibody response. The authors did not further discuss what these antibody levels may indicate, but studies have associated IgG4 antibodies with immune tolerance, which is when the body reduces its immune response to fight off an infection.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/moderna-and-regulatory-agencies-caught-leaving-out-bivalent-vaccine-data-physicians-skeptical-of-timing_4985851.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/1.tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXMPEI5D0J7-FILEDIMAGE-870x522.jpg?itok=h_XHfvc4", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2208343", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-omicron", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/06-COVID-Miller-508.pdf", "/s3/files/inline-images/20210528-Moderna-Vaccine-Syringes-Kingston-ON-CP124184336.jpg?itok=_hYz00Uv", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.17.22283625v1.full", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2213907", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2215780"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
