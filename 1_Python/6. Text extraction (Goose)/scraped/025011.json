Those included loss of days individuals accrued toward retirement, loss of pay or even dismissal from the ranks in a move known as involuntary separation.\n\nBut the rule received heavy pushback from Republican lawmakers and was the subject of several lawsuits. It was eventually dismantled after a rescission requirement was included in the fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act \u2014 a major concession by Democrats to help pass the sweeping legislation before the end of 2022.\n\nAhead of the memo\u2019s release, the U.S. military had stopped all related punishments for refusing the shot, including discharging troops from the service.\n\nIn the document, Austin still argued that the vaccine mandate is meant to ensure force readiness and is critical to the health and safety of the force, giving commanders the reins in deciding whether or not to deploy troops who are not vaccinated.\n\n\u201cAll commanders have the responsibility and authority to preserve the Department\u2019s compelling interests in mission accomplishment,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLeaders are also able \u201cto consider, as appropriate, the individual immunization status of personnel in making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions, including when vaccination is required from travel to, or entry into, a foreign nation,\u201d Austin added.\n\nAs for the thousands of active-duty service members who were discharged for refusing the shots, they will not be reinstated.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article may not represent the official views of Medeea Greere or the American Media Group.
