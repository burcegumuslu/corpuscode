Toxic metals are in the foods we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe. The human body requires extremely trace amounts of a few metals, but too often the concern is with getting too much, rather than too little. Metal poisoning occurs as a result of the unhealthy accumulation of specific metals in the body. Metals become toxic when the quantity is too high and it takes very little to be too much.\n\nMercury, lead, and cadmium are three metals that can be especially harmful. Aluminum has also presented concerns. These toxic metals enter your body through drinking, eating, inhaling, and skin and eye contact. Once in your body, they cause damage at the cellular level by initiating oxidative stress. This damage can contribute to the development of diseases and health concerns.\n\nMercury is highly toxic to your health and can be found in thermometers, dental fillings, seafood, and elsewhere. Mercury can be inhaled or consumed from tainted food. After it enters the body, it gets stored in the kidneys, blood, spleen, brain, liver, bones, and fatty tissues. Frequently, mercury is a danger to those who work in industrial settings and coal power plants. Vaccine production also involves mercury.\n\nYour body has no use for mercury. Exposure at any amount is toxic. Mercury can seriously affect the nervous system and lead to muscular spasms and even death. Pregnant and nursing women should also be cautious as mercury can contaminate breast milk.\n\nAluminum is ridiculously common \u2014 a component of foil, cans, and cookware, antacids, nasal spray, and processed cheese. When aluminum enters your body, it's absorbed and can accumulate in the kidneys, brain, lungs, liver, and thyroid. Aluminum exposure is common with some occupations like welding and mining. In these industries, vapors may be present and inhalation can result in a \u201csuper absorption\u201d status. Aluminum is one of many toxic metals thought to cause brain concerns. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's have been examined for a relation to aluminum accumulation in the brain.\n\nThese Products May Contain Aluminum:\n\nLead has long been known to be hazardous. Drinking water, old homes, and tobacco smoke are all potential sources of toxic lead exposure. Dust and flakes from lead-based paint have caused unbelievable public health nightmares but fortunately, regulations have been able to reduce the concern. When lead enters the body, it goes into the bloodstream and starts depositing itself in the body- bones, soft tissue, and the brain. It's harmful to children and it's harmful to pregnant women. Be extremely cautious of exposure to lead!\n\nProducts That May Contain Lead:\n\nThe human body doesn't need cadmium in any amount and even low levels are toxic. Exposure happens primarily through contaminated foods. However, cigarettes and industry are also sources as are nickel-cadmium batteries, hazardous waste facilities, and fertilizer. Cadmium is slow to exit the body and the negative effects of cadmium are disastrous, affecting the cardiovascular and reproductive systems, kidneys, eyes, and brain.\n\nFoods That May Contain Cadmium:\n\nHow Can I Protect Myself from Toxic Metals?\n\nFirst, establish your baseline. Toxic metal tests can be done by many chiropractors or natural healthcare practitioners using hair, blood or urine analysis. A sauna is great for heat therapy, which dissolves toxins in the blood and lets you sweat them out.\n\nFind a dentist who has experience and knowledge removing mercury fillings and have your mercury amalgam fillings removed immediately. Be cautious of antiperspirants, cookware and utensils that contain aluminum. Avoid food or drink in aluminum cans. Think twice about vaccinations for things that are no longer common.\n\nToxic metals are all around and you need to actively avoid toxic metal exposure. However, total avoidance can be a very tricky proposition \u2014 the stuff is everywhere. Detoxifying and cleansing your body is the next step to reducing the chemical toxins and heavy metals that affect your health.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Heavy Metal Poisoning: The Effects of Toxic Metals", "description": "Toxic metals are all around us and they can cause heavy metal poisoning.
