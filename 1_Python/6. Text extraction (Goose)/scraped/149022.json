But as I went over it it made a little more sense. I will summarize for those of you who don\u2019t want to sit through the whole video.\n\nThere has been a large wave of energy that was unintentionally picked up by the MIMIC TPW microwave background imagery.\n\nThe glitchy curved lines that appear across the screen are the large waves of energy in question. In the video from Dutchsinse.Com he has said-\n\n\u201cThis system usually only shows precipitation / water vapor , yet in some rare instances large energy returns can be seen when solar, spaceweather, and other energy events impact the planet.\n\nWe have seen examples of X class flares, and large Earth facing Coronal Mass Ejections cause large disruptions of this very same feed \u2014 however this \u201cwave\u201d of energy produces a return that crosses the same bandwidths detected (and used by) the MIMIC microwave background system.\n\nThe energy spans the planet on both (all) sides over several hours time. This wave of energy started to form on 12/18 at about 15:00 UTC, and is currently ongoing.\n\nA check of the X-ray flux monitors from GOES shows low activity, minor solar winds, no major solar storms, Total Electron Content in the ionosphere shows \u201cminimal\u201d\u2026. thus the source / cause of this event is still \u201cunknown\u201d.\n\nIf this \u201cevent\u201d really occurred (if it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d) then we\u2019re looking at a huge amount of energy impacting the planet causing a planet wide microwave return going off the scales.\n\nMicrowaves convert to DC energy in a natural \u201crectenna\u201d process when the waves become trapped in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere\u2013 the radio waves convert to DC power, and are taken to ground. Ground ultimately being the core of the Earth.\n\nIf the event is really occurring, then the potential amount of energy going to the core of the planet would be tremendous \u2014 this of course could increase volcanic activity, and cause large earthquakes.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of this \u2014 this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen something this large over such a vast area show up on MIMIC like this.\u201d\n\nThe website which picked up this activity has issued a notice saying \u201c2016 Dec 22: We\u2019re seeing a long segment of bad data being wrapped into this product every few days. This comes from a glitch in the incoming satellite data. For a more accurate representation during those times, try the MIMIC-TPW2 product.\u201d\n\nHowever since this event there has been an influx of earthquakes over the globe with the latest being a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in Chile at 14:22 Christmas day local time. But this is not the only event since this activity has been picked up-\n\nThere have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days.\n\nObviously there are going to be moments when activity is higher, but given the fact that this video predicted it before hand and on the date of this video there was 71 earthquakes over a magnitude 5, we have to question the statement. Perhaps it is a type of energy they do not understand.\n\nYou can view the earthquake reports here\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the next few days unfold and we will keep you updated on the progress.
