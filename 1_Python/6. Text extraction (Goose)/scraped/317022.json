Over a period of two decades, Mr. O\u2019Brien has had an extensive degree of involvement and interaction with the House Democratic leadership, with myriad Democratic members across a wide array of House committees and with the leadership of the DCCC,\u201d explains his professional bio.\n\nHe has also worked \u201cat the most elevated participation level with the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee (DSCC),\u201d charging its \u201cpremier individual donor group, the Legacy Circle, since the inception of the program in 2006.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was designated a \u201cLifetime Member\u201d of the Legacy Circle in 2014. In addition, he is the recipient of what the DSCC describes as one of the highest honors it can bestow, an award of lifetime membership in its \u201cMajority Trust\u201d program. In the award letter to Mr. O\u2019Brien, Senator Schumer, then Chair of the DSCC, stated, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more qualified Democrat to receive this honor,\u201d his bio continues.\n\nAnother Ant Group lobbyist on behalf of the OB-C Group, Thomas J.
