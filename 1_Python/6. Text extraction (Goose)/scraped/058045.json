They superseded the 2021 model policies put in place by former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat.\n\nAmong the new policies were the requirement for students to use bathrooms and locker rooms designated for their biological sex. Sports teams participants are also to be segregated by sex.\n\nThe VDOE\u2019s proposed policies last year were the complete opposite of these. The earlier edicts called for bathrooms and locker rooms to be accessible to all regardless of biological sex. It also permitted students to \u201cchange genders\u201d with nothing more than a verbal declaration of their gender identity.\n\nThe report also indicated that school faculty and staff are not permitted to keep information such as \u201cgender identity\u201d from parents, and no teacher or student can be forced to call students any name or pronoun that \u201cwould violate their constitutionally protected rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo ensure parents are able to make the best decisions with respect to their child, school personnel shall keep parents fully informed about all matters that may be reasonably expected to be important to a parent, including, and without limitation, matters related to their child\u2019s health, and social and psychological development,\u201d it stated. \u201cParents\u2019 rights are affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court that characterized a parent\u2019s right to raise his or her child as \u2018perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court.'\u201d\n\n\u201cParents are in the best position to work with their children and, where appropriate, their children\u2019s health care providers to determine what names, nicknames and/or pronouns, if any, shall be used for their child by teachers and school staff while their child is at school.\u201d (Related: Virginia reverses transgender school policy, returns right to affirm children\u2019s gender to parents.)\n\nThe Sept. 16 document with its policies against transgenderism was the brainchild of incumbent Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican elected as the Old Dominion\u2019s chief executive in 2021.\n\nIt blasted the previous policies from Northam because they \u201cpromoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools.\u201d Moreover, the edict by Youngkin\u2019s predecessor \u201cdisregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Sept. 16 report superseded the 2021 policies, which are no longer effective in any capacity. However, the report is still subject to a 30-day public comment period, which will start on Sept. 26.\n\nMike Mullin, Democratic whip at the Virginia House of Delegates, slammed the new policies. He tweeted that Youngkin\u2019s \u201cabsolutely shameful\u201d policy \u201ccalls for the misgendering and outing of children in schools where they\u2019re supposed to be safe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats in the U.S. Senate described the changes in a joint statement as \u201can outright violation of Virginians\u2019 civil rights.\u201d\n\nMacaulay Porter, press secretary for Youngkin, said the new policies deliver on \u201cthe governor\u2019s commitment to preserving parental rights and upholding the dignity and respect of all public school students.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not under a school\u2019s or the government\u2019s purview to impose a set of particular ideological beliefs on all students. Key decisions rest, first and foremost, with the parents,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe previous policies implemented under the Northam administration did not uphold constitutional principles and parental rights, and will be replaced.\u201d\n\nVisit PublicEducation.news for more stories like this.\n\nWatch Martin Brodel talk about the pro-LGBT school platform of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, who Youngkin defeated in the 2021 state elections.\n\nThis video is from the Martin Brodel channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSchool choice quickly becoming the \u201claw of the land\u201d \u2013 Republicans should jump aboard and follow Virginia Governor Youngkin\u2019s lead.\n\nVirginia school board actually considering new curriculum that teaches kids there is NO such thing as \u201cbiological sex.\u201d\n\nBack-to-school students are being subjected to a whole new wave of transgender indoctrination and left-wing lunacy.\n\nVA Education Department finalizing policies to ensure transparency of sex education materials for public schools.", "opengraph": {"title": "VA Education Department updates model policies for public schools, requires adherence to students\u2019 BIOLOGICAL SEX", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-09-23-va-educ-dept-requires-adherence-students-biological.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "The Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) updated its model policies for public schools, with the revisions requiring schools to adhere to students\u2019 biological sex.
