But high-profile purveyors of misinformation have been promoting the long-standing false claim that it does.\n\nNo vaccine or medical product is 100% safe, but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval, followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high-quality and free of contaminants.One key vaccine safety surveillance program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, which is an early warning system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA. As its website explains, VAERS \u201cis not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.\u201d Anyone can submit a report to VAERS for any health problem that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem. The information is still valuable because it\u2019s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety issue with a vaccine, which can then be followed-up by government scientists. Another monitoring system is the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people, which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts, revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks. The CDC and FDA vaccine safety monitoring systems, which were expanded for the COVID-19 vaccines and also include a new smartphone-based reporting tool called v-safe, have subsequently identified only a few, very rare adverse events. For more, see \u201cHow safe are the vaccines?\u201d\n\nMost people in the U.S. \u2014 about 80% \u2014 have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they\u2019ve been able to donate blood since the vaccines first became available, according to guidance from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSo it\u2019s been almost two full years that blood from vaccinated donors has been used for transfusions, Dr. Roy Silverstein, chair of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Division of Hematology and Oncology, told us in a phone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of any kind of safety concern,\u201d he said.\n\nBut anti-vaccine campaigners have recently focused on a claim that\u2019s been lingering since the vaccines first became available \u2014 the unfounded idea that those who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 have \u201cclean blood\u201d or \u201cpure blood\u201d and that it\u2019s dangerous for them to receive a transfusion from someone who is vaccinated. The term \u201cpure blood\u201d has been embraced by at least one member of Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has a history of spreading vaccine misinformation.\n\nThis theory has recently become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among major conspiracy theorists \u2014 including Alex Jones, David Icke and Stew Peters \u2014 since a couple in New Zealand has sought to delay heart surgery for their infant until the hospital agrees to use blood from an unvaccinated donor during the operation. A New Zealand court has now granted a temporary medical guardianship for the baby so that he can undergo the procedure.\n\nOne post on Substack that\u2019s a mash-up of two notorious purveyors of COVID-19 misinformation \u2014 Steve Kirsch and Dr. Ryan Cole \u2014 claims that because of COVID-19 vaccination, \u201cThe safety of the blood supply is unknown.\u201d\n\nDoctors and organizations such as the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies have been explaining for more than a year that concerns about blood from vaccinated individuals are unfounded. The AABB actually issued guidance to help doctors answer patient questions on the issue.\n\nPosts like the one from Kirsch and Cole \u2014 each of whom are associated with organizations that promote false claims about vaccination and collect monetary donations \u2014 are pandering to those who don\u2019t want to believe science, Silverstein said.\n\n\u201cPeople are trying to make money out of bad science, which is really disturbing to me,\u201d he said, because it undermines the whole system.\n\nBlood used for transfusions in the U.S. is regulated by the FDA, which requires each unit of donated blood to be tested for infectious disease and requires donors to be screened.\n\nThe vaccines that are available in the U.S. would not pose any risk of infecting either the recipient of the vaccine with the virus that causes COVID-19 or anyone who might receive a blood transfusion from that person, since none of the available vaccines use a live attenuated virus. Rather, they use just a small part of the virus \u2014 or provide instructions for cells to make such a fragment \u2014 to instruct the immune system on how to recognize it and fight infection.\n\nThe most common type of COVID-19 vaccine used in the U.S. is an mRNA vaccine \u2014 the m stands for messenger \u2014 which is injected into the muscle. Cells read the RNA \u201cinstructions\u201d to produce coronavirus spike proteins, which prompt the immune system to respond, including the production of protective antibodies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that happens when you get vaccinated that doesn\u2019t also happen when you get infected,\u201d E. John Wherry, chair of the department of systems pharmacology and translational therapeutics and director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Institute for Immunology at the Perelman School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe immune response to the vaccine is really a subset of what your immune response following infection would be, he said, concluding, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing really qualitatively different.\u201d\n\nThe only real difference is that the vaccine causes a response targeted at the unique spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19, whereas someone who had been infected would also produce antibodies that recognize other parts of the virus.\n\nThe mRNA doesn\u2019t last long after it\u2019s done its job triggering an immune response, Wherry said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see the mRNA sticking around, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nWithin days of vaccination, Silverstein said, \u201cthere\u2019s no trace of any of the mRNA in the blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf an unvaccinated person gets a blood transfusion from a vaccinated donor, the unvaccinated person does not become vaccinated,\u201d Malia Jones, a public health researcher, explained in a post in March.\n\n\u201cA vaccine contains extremely small amounts of both active & inactive ingredients which never enter our bloodstream in the same way as other medications like pain relievers, antibiotics, or antidepressants,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAll the action comes from your own immune system.\u201d\n\nSo there\u2019s no cause for concern about getting a blood transfusion from a vaccinated donor. As Silverstein pointed out, blood from vaccinated donors has been in the supply for almost two years with no health issues.\n\nBut, as was noted early on by doctors who encountered hesitation from patients who didn\u2019t want a transfusion from a vaccinated donor, much of the concern is based on now-entrenched beliefs in misinformation about vaccines.\n\nPurveyors of misinformation also continue to build on previous claims. For example, the post from Kirsch and Cole that claims the blood supply may be unsafe references the baseless claim that vaccines are causing unusual blood clots that are killing swaths of people. Both Kirsch and Cole were featured in a viral video posted in November called \u201cDied Suddenly\u201d that pushed that claim, which we\u2019ve explained has no merit.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
