Moreover, since the Delta covid outbreak is still accelerating in Israel, the effectiveness against hospitalization and severe disease may further decrease (due to lags in hospitalizations).\n\nIn the UK, which has primarily used the AstraZeneca DNA adenovector vaccine, the latest estimate by researchers at University College London indicates an effectiveness against infection of only 8% and a total effectiveness against severe disease of about 60%. In very senior citizens, the effectiveness against severe disease may be even lower (due to a weaker immune response).\n\nThe Israeli data shown above indicates that effectiveness against infection and mild symptoms decreases rapidly over time and reaches near-zero levels after about half a year. Most likely, this is because covid vaccines do not achieve mucosal immunity (in contrast to natural infection) and serum antibody levels (i.e. antibodies in the blood) decrease within months (see chart below).\n\nThus, the false promise of very high protection against \u201csymptomatic infection\u201d, found during official vaccine trials, was simply based on very high short-term serum antibody levels mimicking mucosal immunity. From an immunological perspective, this was just a (very lucrative) \u201cflash in the pan\u201d and not a lasting protective effect.\n\nIn contrast, protection against severe disease is achieved by lower serum antibody levels in combination with immunological memory (B cells) and cellular immunity (T cells). However, the Delta variant has already achieved partial immune evasion (as did Beta and Gamma, but not Alpha), and future coronavirus variants will likely achieve almost complete immune evasion.\n\nThus, vaccine protection even against severe disease will likely further decrease due to new variants, or, in the very worst case, will turn into antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE), if high levels of non-neutralizing antibodies aggravate the infection. Indeed, this is what happened in the case of vaccines against SARS-1 and dengue fever. (Update: A first molecular modelling study has found evidence of a potential ADE mechanism in people vaccinated against covid.)\n\nTo prevent such a decrease in protection against severe disease, or to restore short-term protection against infection and mild disease, updated \u201cbooster shots\u201d will likely become necessary. (Update: On July 29, Israel announced \u201cbooster shots\u201d for people over 60 years of age.)\n\nHowever, there is a very real risk that additional vaccinations, which inject or induce the coronavirus spike protein, could substantially increase the risk of serious cardiovascular and neurological adverse events, such as strokes, GBS and heart muscle inflammation. Globally, covid vaccines may already have killed tens of thousands of people. Alternatives include safer nasal vaccine candidates or medically supervised, low-dose oral live virus challenges in low-risk people.\n\nFurthermore, the millions of people who were told that vaccination will protect them against a coronavirus infection will soon have to realize (once again) that this is not the case: instead, most of them will get infected anyway. On the positive side, this may actually provide additional mucosal immunity to large parts of the population while being mostly protected against severe disease.\n\nIndeed, data from Israel as well as recent studies all indicate that a previous coronavirus infection continues to offer the best protection against future infections and disease. (Update: A US study confirmed that previously infected people don\u2019t benefit from vaccination.)\n\nIn contrast, vaccination cannot achieve \u201csterile immunity\u201d against infection and infectiousness. Thus, the whole idea of \u201cvaccination certificates\u201d has become obsolete \u2013 at least from a medical and epidemiological perspective \u2013 and should be rejected: the claim that it\u2019s just \u201cthe unvaccinated\u201d that are driving outbreaks \u2013 a claim made by many authorities \u2013 is simply false.\n\nFor instance, just this week a \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d Australian managed to pre-symptomatically infect about 60 people at a party in the United States. Many similar stories have already been reported in Europe and Israel: fully vaccinated people can easily transmit the virus even to large groups. Hence, imposing \u201cvaccination certificates\u201d or \u201cgreen passes\u201d may only serve a political purpose.\n\nIn many countries, mass vaccination campaigns have themselves triggered large coronavirus outbreaks (\u201cpost-first dose spike\u201d), possibly due to a combination of vaccine-induced temporary immune suppression and infections at large indoor vaccination centers visited by thousands of people. The vaccine-induced temporary immune suppression may also explain the frequently observed post-vaccination appearance of shingles (i.e. herpes zoster reactivation).\n\nConcerning children, since covid remains mostly asymptomatic or mild in them anyway, and since vaccination cannot prevent infection and infectiousness, the vaccination of children and even of young low-risk adults becomes increasingly difficult to justify, especially given the very real vaccine-associated cardiovascular risks to them (e.g. teen myocarditis and cerebral blood clots).\n\nA look at covid data in places like Israel, the UK and Portugal \u2013 which were first in Europe to experience the Delta variant summer wave \u2013 confirms that, while infections have skyrocketed, hospitalizations have remained rather low and deaths have remained very low so far (see charts below). In contrast, in countries with a low vaccination rate \u2013 such as India, Russia, as well as many Asian and African countries, Delta covid deaths have reached all-time record levels (see below).\n\nIn conclusion, vaccine protection against infection and \u201cmild disease\u201d has pretty much collapsed, whereas protection against severe disease and death remains at a reasonable level, with the partial exception of the most senior citizens and especially nursing home residents, some of whom have never mounted a neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine. Moreover, future coronavirus variants will likely achieve additional immune evasion.\n\nGiven the current situation and outlook, it may once again be emphasized that research and implementation of early treatment options for high-risk patients \u2013 especially anti-viral, anti-inflammatory (immuno-modulatory) and anti-thrombotic treatment \u2013 should be a top priority.\n\nYou have been reading: Covid Vaccines: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly.\n\n An analysis by Swiss Policy Research.\n\nSerum antibody levels after vaccination with Pfizer (blue) and AstraZeneca (red).\n\nDelta cases and deaths in countries with high and low vaccination rate.\n\nCoronavirus variants escaping from major antibody classes 1 to 3.
