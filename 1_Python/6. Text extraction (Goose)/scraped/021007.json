The CDC is urging health care providers to take every rash seriously, as if it might be monkeypox. It doesn\u2019t matter if the rash is from more common infections (varicella zoster, herpes zoster, syphilis), the CDC is urging healthcare providers to evaluate homosexual men for monkeypox and test them for it.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra held a press conference confirming that 99% of cases have occurred in men who have recently engaged in sexual activities with other men. The CDC is now urging homosexual men to stop having anal intercourse with multiple partners, unless they get vaccinated first.\n\nCDC calls on homosexual men to stop having anal intercourse until they are vaccinated for monkeypox\n\nAt first, the CDC hesitated to report the truth about whom these outbreaks were affecting. Individuals most at risk are men who have sex with other men, who have also been fully vaccinated and boosted for covid-19. On August 5, the CDC finally updated their monkeypox guidelines to warn homosexual men to stop having anal intercourse with multiple partners.\n\nOn the CDC\u2019s new webpage, \u201cSafer Sex, Social Gatherings, and Monkeypox,\u201d the CDC warned homosexual men to \u201ctake a temporary break\u201d from anal intercourse until they get vaccinated first. This is the only way to help \u201ccontain\u2026the outbreak,\u201d the CDC assures.\n\nThe CDC also instructed homosexuals to avoid \u201cspaces\u201d for anonymous sex with multiple partners and to wear gloves during specific sexual activities. The CDC warns the gay community: \u201cThe best way to protect yourself and others is to avoid sex of any kind \u2026 while you are sick.\u201d The CDC warns the LGBTQ community to also \u201cavoid touching any rash\u201d and not to attend festivals or raves.\n\n\u201cMonkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, but it is often transmitted through close, sustained physical contact, which can include sexual contact,\u201d the CDC warns. \u201cA rave, party, or club where there is minimal clothing and where there is direct, personal, often skin-to-skin contact has some risk. Avoid any rash you see on others and consider minimizing skin-to-skin contact,\u201d the CDC webpage reads.\n\nRise of rare monkeypox in homosexual community proves they are now immunocompromised with VAIDS from covid-19 vaccines\n\nThere\u2019s more to the story than just transmission. The covid-19 vaccines have caused widespread immune-deficiencies that make people more susceptible to other infections (as known as vaccine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). One study showed that the vaccinated are witnessing \u201cprofound impairments in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health.\u201d\n\nMonkeypox was always an infection that rarely, if ever, occurred in developed nations. Monkeypox is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. According to the CDC, early symptoms include high fever, head and body aches and sometimes vomiting. During the second phase of the infection, sores begin to appear over the body during a ten-day period. These sores become pustules. These round pustules are sharply raised and feel like peas under the skin. After five days, the pustules crust over and turn into scabs.\n\nFor decades, cases of monkeypox were isolated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and sometimes occurred in Sudan. There has only been one reported case in the United States before 2022, and that case showed up about twenty years ago. In 2003, rodents from Ghana had reportedly infected American prairie dogs, before spreading to a human vector. The outbreak was stopped in its tracks.\n\nNow, monkeypox is taking advantage of individuals who have had their immune system wiped out by multiple influenza and covid-19 vaccines. As of August 4, 2022, there are a reported 6,000 cases of monkeypox , in the US, with an unknown case count that has gone unreported. Men who routinely have anal sex with other men are at greater risk, because they engage in activities that readily transmit infectious microorganisms, now including monkeypox.\n\nThe US is making available 1.1 million doses of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine. The CDC notes that vaccine will be \u201can important tool in preventing the spread of monkeypox,\u201d but it\u2019s hard to know whether or not these over-vaccinated homosexual populations even have a functioning immune system left. Their immune systems have been depleted by multiple vaccines that damage innate immune function, and they may not even be capable of responding effectively to the antigens in the monkeypox vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "The CDC finally tells homosexual men to stop having anal intercourse with so many partners\u2026 unless they get vaccinated first", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2022-08-11-cdc-tells-homo-men-stop-anal-intercourse-multiple-partners-unless-vaccinated.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "After the federal government declared monkeypox a \u201cnational public health emergency,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) activated their Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and deployed 300 pandemic \u201cfirefighters\u201d who will activate resources nationwide which includes local, national and international response partners.
