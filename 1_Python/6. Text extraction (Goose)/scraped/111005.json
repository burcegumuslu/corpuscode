But this hasn\u2019t stopped him from speaking out. This week he has given interviews with Irreverend and, a few days later, James Delingpole. In this article, we refer to the first interview. You can watch Mr. Bridgen\u2019s interview with Delingpole HERE.\n\nMr. Bridgen\u2019s speech is on both Parliament TV and YouTube. And, despite Mr. Bridgen sending them a press pack, corporate media have gaslighted it except for an article the next day in the Express and Scottish Daily Express.\n\nOf course, Full Fact has written a blog. \u201cYellow Card reporting rate estimates shouldn\u2019t be applied to Covid-19 vaccines,\u201d they wrote. Why? Because \u201cit is estimated that only 10% of serious reactions and between 2 and 4% of non-serious reactions are reported,\u201d Full Fact said without so much as a hint of recognising the irony in their reasoning.\n\nAnother argument Full Fact attempted to make was that absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction are two different things \u2013 a point Mr. Bridgen had already highlighted in his speech. On another point, simply because Full Fact\u2019s bloggers weren\u2019t able to replicate statistics Mr. Bridgen used from a study regarding children under 5, the blogger determines Mr. Bridgen\u2019s statistics can\u2019t be true.\n\nThe final point Full Fact made beggars belief. The conscientious bloggers overlooked the part in Mr. Bridgen\u2019s speech regarding the conflicts of interest and corruption in the UK\u2019s regulatory bodies and boldly argued Mr. Briggen must be wrong because \u201cmRNA Covid-19 vaccines have been approved as safe and effective.\u201d You couldn\u2019t make it up!\n\nA week to the day after Mr. Bridgen courageously gave his speech calling for the suspension of Covid injections, he was given a 5-day suspension from Parliament and could be in danger of losing almost a month\u2019s pay.\n\nThe reasons given for the suspension were:\n\u2022 two days for failing to declare that he received a paid trip to Ghana in eight emails to ministers; and\n\u2022 three days for writing to the Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone asking if she had been lobbying to receive a peerage.\n\nExpress UK reported that there had been concerns that he could have had his suspension doubled to 10 days after an appeal, which would have triggered a recall vote in his constituency but his suspension remains at five days.\n\nAs the news of Mr. Bridgen\u2019s suspension was breaking, Darren McCaffrey of GB News reported that Mr. Bridgen\u2019s suspension was in no way related to his speaking out against vaccine harms because it dates back to a couple of months ago. Mr. Bridgen had filed an appeal and it was his appeal that was denied on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, we cannot ignore that Mr. Bridgen was suspended from Parliament and is also the one who publicly called out the safety of the Covid injections in no uncertain terms. Mr. Bridgen may have been found guilty of breaking the rules, but is he the only one?\n\nThere have been 11 MPs suspended from Parliament since the beginning of 2020, each being given between one and five days suspension. Installed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is not one of them. Whatever Mr. Bridgen\u2019s trip to Ghana was worth, it\u2019s nowhere near the amount of \u00a32.1m per year income tax Sunak\u2019s wife avoided paying. This tax avoidance was also happening when Sunak was Chancellor of the Exchequer and was responsible for raising revenue through taxation or borrowing and for controlling public spending.\n\nSunak is not the only MP who as acted dubiously over the last three years. For more than a year, Good Law Project has been working to uncover the politically-connected firms that benefitted from the Government\u2019s \u00a337 billion Test and Trace programme. \u201cWe know that 50 companies with close links to Ministers, Peers and Government officials were given access to a priority route through which they secured lucrative Covid testing contracts,\u201d they wrote in June. Michael Gove was one of those who referred firms down a fast track \u2018VIP\u2019 route to bid for lucrative Test and Trace contracts.\n\nThere were also VIP Lanes for personal protective equipment (\u201cPPE\u201d) referred by, for example, Siobhan Baillie, MP for Stroud. According to a National Audit Office (\u201cNOA\u201d) report in March 2022, the Department of Health & Social Care (\u201cDHSC\u201d) had awarded 394 PPE contracts worth \u00a37.9 billion. Of the 394 contracts awarded, 115 were awarded to 51 VIP lane suppliers. And surprisingly little of the PPE reached its intended destination. NOA\u2019s report stated that DHSC had received 31.5 billion items of PPE in the UK (of which only 55% had been actually distributed to health and social care settings), with another 1.4 billion stored in China and 5.0 billion still to be received.\n\nHow many of the MPs involved in VIP Lanes have been investigated or suspended?\n\nOn Saturday Irreverend interviewed Mr. Bridgen about the emerging evidence that calls into question the safety of mRNA injections.\n\nThe scientific evidence does not support the further use of the mRNA vaccines, Mr. Bridgen said.\n\nMr. Bridgen had read biological sciences at Nottingham University. He specialised, mostly, in genetics and behaviour. His dissertation in his final year was on viruses and viroids.\n\nHe was uncomfortable with the Government\u2019s lockdown policies and approach to the so-called Covid pandemic. (Yes Mr. Bridgen used the term \u201cso-called Covid pandemic\u201d!) \u201cI was very reluctant to vote for the lockdowns,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t vote for the last two lockdowns. I voted against \u2018Plan B\u2019. I\u2019m sceptical about the mask-wearing.\u201d However, to begin with, Mr. Bridgen wasn\u2019t sceptical about the Covid injection. He has had two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca. But \u201cthe data that\u2019s coming in from harms \u2013 the Yellow Card data \u2013 and then when you actually speak to sceptical professionals but they take you through the scientific papers and the evidence \u2026 [its] deeply worrying,\u201d he said. \u201c[The vaccines] are not safe, they\u2019re not effective and they\u2019re not necessary.\u201d\n\nMr. Bridgen met with Pfizer in November 2020. \u201cThese people [from Pfizer] told me then \u2026 that we\u2019ll be taking these vaccines every three months for the rest of our lives and, basically, they were going to make a fortune out of us,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bridgen is hoping that, following his appeal, scientists, doctors, nurses and those in the media who know but aren\u2019t saying anything will take some strength and courage from his remarks. \u201cNow\u2019s the Time to come forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are other MPs, from both sides of the House, who have the same concerns, said Mr. Bridgen, but they\u2019re scared and afraid to speak out.\n\nIf the video above is removed from YouTube you can watch it on Rumble HERE or Odysee HERE.\n\nHow should we, the people, respond to what is happening. We need to stand up and let our voices be heard. GB News\u2019 Neil Oliver sums it up in one of his world-famous monologues: \u201cIf our MPs don\u2019t care enough about harms to population, it\u2019s time we reminded the whole damned lot of them we are still here.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "UK MP is Suspended from Parliament a Week after \u201cVaccine Harms\" Speech But He Has Not Been Silenced [VIDEO] - Europe Reloaded", "description": "ER Editor: We published UK MP Andrew Bridgen\u2018s famous 17 minute speech to a scandalously empty Parliament chamber.
