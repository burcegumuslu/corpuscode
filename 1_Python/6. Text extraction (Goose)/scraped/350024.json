His more than 100 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have resulted in copious evidence that the vaccine preservative Thimerosal, which is still used in the flu shot that is administered to pregnant women and infants, can cause autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nDr. Hooker, a PhD scientist, worked with two members of Congress to craft the letter to the CDC that recently resulted in his obtaining long-awaited data from the CDC, the significance of which is historic. According to Hooker, the data on over 400,000 infants born between 1991 and 1997, which was analyzed by CDC epidemiologist Thomas Verstraeten, MD, \u201cproves unequivocally that in 2000, CDC officials were informed internally of the very high risk of autism, non-organic sleep disorder and speech disorder associated with Thimerosal exposure.\u201d\n\nFactually, thimerosal is a mercury-containing compound that is a known human carcinogen, mutagen, teratogen and immune-system disruptor at levels below 1 part-per-million, and a compound to which some humans can have an anaphylactic shock reaction. It is also a recognized reproductive and fetal toxin with no established toxicologically safe level of exposure for humans.\n\nIn November, 1997, the U.S. Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, requiring the study of mercury content in FDA-approved products. The review disclosed the hitherto-unrecognized levels of ethylmercury in vaccines.\n\nIn July 1999, public-health officials announced that thimerosal would be phased out of vaccines. The CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, and FDA insisted that the measure was purely precautionary. They requested of all vaccine manufacturers to eliminate mercury from vaccines.\n\nThe requests were denied by vaccine manufacturers and continued every year thereafter.\n\nThe FDA does not require ingredients that comprise less than 1 percent of a product to be divulged on the label, so a lot more products may have thimerosal and consumers will never know.\n\nWhen the results of the Verstraeten study were first reported outside the CDC in 2005, there was no evidence that anyone but Dr. Verstraeten within the CDC had known of the very high 7.6-fold elevated relative risk of autism from exposure to Thimerosal during infancy. But now, clear evidence exists. A newly-acquired abstract from 1999 titled, \u201cIncreased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to Thimerosal containing vaccine in first month of life\u201d required the approval of top CDC officials prior to its presentation at the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) conference. Thimerosal, which is 50% mercury by weight, was used in most childhood vaccines and in the RhoGAM shot for pregnant women prior to the early 2000s.\n\nThe CDC maintains there is \u201cno relationship between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism rates in children,\u201d even though the data from the CDC\u2019s own Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database shows a very high risk. There are a number of public records to back this up, including this Congressional Record from May 1, 2003. The CDC\u2019s refusal to acknowledge thimerosal\u2019s risks is exemplified by a leaked statement from Dr. Marie McCormick, chair of the CDC/NIH-sponsored Immunization Safety Review at IOM. Regarding vaccination, she said in 2001, \u201c\u2026we are not ever going to come down that it [autism] is a true side effect\u2026\u201d Also of note, the former director of the CDC, which purchases $4 billion worth of vaccines annually, is now president of Merck\u2019s vaccine division.\n\nToxic Effects of Thimerosal No Longer Disputed by Scientific Study\n\nThimerosal-Derived Ethylmercury in vaccines is now well established as a mitochondrial toxin in human brain cells.\n\nThere are dozens of scientific inquiries and studies on the adverse effects of thimerosal, including gastrointestinal abnormalities and immune system irregularities.\n\nThimerosal, is metabolized (converted) into the toxic and \u201charmful\u201d methylmercury. And then in turn, the harmful methylmercury is metabolized (converted) into the most harmful, long-term-toxic, \u201cinorganic\u201d mercury that is retained in bodily tissue.\n\n\u201cInorganic\u201d mercury is the end product of mercury metabolism. Methylmercury subject groups confirm that the metabolic pathway for mercury in the human and animal body consists in the reduction/conversion of the harmful methylmercury into a more harmful \u201cinorganic\u201d mercury which is tissue-bound, and long-term-toxic. Hence, both the originating substance (methylmercury) and its conversion/reduction, inorganic mercury are found.\n\nBased on published findings by Dr. Paul King, the metabolic pathway for organic mercury involves the conversion of Ethylmercury (Thimerosal) into \u201cmethylmercury\u201d and then the further reduction of \u201cmethylmercury\u201d into inorganic mercury.\n\nDr. Hooker\u2019s fervent hope for the future: \u201cWe must ensure that this and other evidence of CDC malfeasance are presented to Congress and the public as quickly as possible. Time is of the essence. Children\u2019s futures are at stake.\u201d A divide within the autism community has led to some activists demanding that compensation to those with vaccine-injury claims be the top priority before Congress. Dr. Hooker maintains that prevention, \u201cprotecting our most precious resource \u2014 children\u2019s minds,\u201d must come first. \u201cOur elected officials must be informed about government corruption that keeps doctors and patients in the dark about vaccine risks.\u201d\n\nReferring to an organization that has seen its share of controversy this past year, Dr. Hooker remarked, \u201cIt is unfortunate that SafeMinds issued a press release on my information, is accepting credit for my work and has not supported a worldwide ban on Thimerosal.\u201d\n\nBrian Hooker, PhD, PE, has 15 years experience in the field of bioengineering and is an associate professor at Simpson University where he specializes in biology and chemistry. His over 50 science and engineering papers have been published in internationally recognized, peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Hooker has a son, aged 16, who developed normally but then regressed into autism after receiving Thimerosal-containing vaccines.", "opengraph": {"description": "PhD Scientist and Biochemist Reveals Hidden CDC Documents Showing Thimerosal In Vaccines Increase Neurologic Disorders.
