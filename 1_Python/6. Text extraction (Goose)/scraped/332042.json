Mercury, aluminum, vaccine-related chemicals, and environmental poisons including arsenic, lead, cadmium, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds are just some of what we are exposed to every day. Imagine the damaging effects of heavy metals when they are injected into our bodies through vaccines?\n\nBy some estimates, we are exposed to over 80,000 chemicals in our daily lives in our food, water, and air. These toxic substances accumulate in our organs and our body fat leading to inflammation that affects our sleep, memory, concentration, and overall health (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nConventional medicine doesn\u2019t have an answer to this modern problem. In fact, most physicians don\u2019t even recognize the toxic assault of chemicals as being toxic! The solution is not found in our pharma-based healthcare system, but a natural solution comes from nature.\n\nAs a physician who has spent the last 20 years looking at ways to detox the body gently, I am very excited that I have found this product. It is a rare natural mineral, created through a reaction of volcanic ash and seawater. It can cleanse the body down to the cellular level. The mineral has a negative charge and is formed in the shape of a honeycomb so it can bind positively charged chemicals and metals, chelating (eliminating) them from the body.\n\nZeolite is a member of a family of minerals that contain both alkali and alkaline-earth metals. Clinoptilolite zeolite is the type of zeolite that has been widely studied for its ability to:\n\u2022 Protect against leaky gut by strengthening the intestinal wall (8)\n\u2022 And much more, as extensive clinical research shows (9)\n\nBased on the testimonials I\u2019ve seen, the detoxification and health benefits of the Clinoptilolite zeolite are exceptional. This particular form of zeolite is thought to be hundreds of times more effective than activated charcoal, a commonly used compound that can detox the gut but comes with harsh side effects.\n\nClinoptilolite zeolite can bind to toxins deposited throughout the body. It has been designed to have an affinity for toxins only. It does not remove beneficial minerals, and there are no negative side effects.\n\nMost Zeolite Products Do Not Work\n\nThere are other zeolite products on the market. I have used several of them in the past without much success. To most from the gut and into cells, the zeolite must be nanosized and suspended in water molecule clusters. With that formation, this natural detoxifier can travel throughout the body and even cross the blood-brain barrier. You can start to see why this is important for those who want to detox from vaccines.\n\nWhen zeolite is mined, it comes filled with environmental pollutants. That\u2019s because even nature, zeolites are good at absorbing toxins. However, if the zeolite is already filled with toxic substances, it can\u2019t remove anything from your body. That\u2019s why most zeolite products don\u2019t work, and why I haven\u2019t recommended one before.\n\nThe Most Effective Zeolite on the Market is Backed by Science\n\nAfter doing extensive research, I discovered Pure Body Extra Strength manufactured and distributed by a company called Touchstone Essentials. They use a cleansing and nanosizing technology that is hands-down the most advanced on the market. The particles that are contaminating the zeolite are removed and the zeolite honey-comb is filled with alkalizing minerals. That way, the zeolite \u201cswaps out\u201d a beneficial mineral for a toxin it absorbs. The amount removed has been confirmed by a third-party independent laboratory.\n\nThe Clinoptilolite zeolite particles are so small they are invisible to the naked eye. This observation is backed by the gold standard in instrumentation \u2013 Malvern particle size testing.\n\nNanometer-sized particles can get into cells and can \u201cmop up\u201d toxins within hours of administration. And because this form of zeolite is encapsulated within water molecule clusters, it can be administered as a liquid spray. That makes it easy to use: just take a few sprays, morning, noon, and night. There is no odor, no taste, and no hassle.\n\nBecause pollutants have been removed from Pure Body Extra Strength it can effectively remove heavy metals.\n\nThe most important aspect for me has been the patient testimonials. Let me share a few of the incredible statements people have made about using Pure Body Extra Strength:\n\nWith over 300 studies listed on PubMed on the beneficial properties of the Clinoptilolite zeolite, this mineral has a solid reputation for removing toxicities from the body. Other zeolite products are synthetically made and work best for industrial processes.\n\nTry this amazing product?
