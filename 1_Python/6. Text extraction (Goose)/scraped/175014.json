In just 2\u00bd months, already the vaccine has lost 56% of its antibody levels.\n\nAn \u201cexponential decrease\u201d in vaccine effectiveness of up to 40% per month after last shot\n\nAnother new study highlights the precipitous drop in antibody protection almost immediately following getting jabbed for the second time.\n\nWhile those with natural immunity from a prior COVID-19 infection (convalescents) lose <5% antibody protection per month after a COVID-19 infection, vaccinated-only individuals lose up to 40% of their immunity protection every month after their last shot.\n\nAt this pace, the artificial immunity afforded by vaccines wears off within a few months.\n\nIf strong and lasting protection from symptomatic disease, hospitalization, and death favors natural infection with COVID-19 over vaccination, then an understandable, \u201cCatch-22\u201d objection would be that it is still worse to be infected with COVID-19 than injected with the various immunizing vaccines available.\n\nSo here is the larger context worth considering.\n\nUnderestimating the prevalence of COVID-19 infections vastly overestimates the fatality rate\n\nThroughout 2020 several studies emerged assessing the actual prevalence COVID-19 infections in communities from antibody tests rather than just relying upon the number of confirmed cases. Because up to 96% of individuals contracting COVID-19 may have no symptoms, it is quite common for those infected with COVID-19 to not even know it. Therefore the prevalence \u2013 or number of individuals who have actually had COVID \u2013 has been assessed to be substantially higher in communities than when only using the number of confirmed cases suggests.\n\nIn Santa Clara, California, for example, the prevalence of COVID was assessed to be ~53,000 cases when extrapolating the assessed number of people with COVID-19 antibodies (seroprevalence). Instead of ~53,000, the number of confirmed cases in Santa Clara at the time of the study was 948, which is \u201c56-fold lower than the number of infections predicted by this study\u201d (Bendavid et al., 2021).\n\nAnother study (Doi et al., 2021) suggested the prevalence was \u201c396 to 858-fold more than confirmed cases with PCR testing.\u201d\n\nWith a much higher prevalence comes a much lower number of deaths per infection, or infection fatality rate (IFR).\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, our findings imply that \u2248518,000 persons in Guilan Province may have been infected with SARS-COV-2 as of April 19, 2020, which is substantially higher than the 1,600 cumulative confirmed cases recorded. As of May 3, if we assume a 3-week lag from time of infection to death, 625 persons had died of confirmed COVID-19 in Guilan Province. This number would correspond to an infection-fatality rate of 0.12%\u201d [ ].\n\nThe global infection fatality rate for COVID-19 is 0.23%\n\nAccording to a highly-cited synthesis of 61 studies from 51 locations across the globe using antibody (seroprevalence) data (Ioannidis, 2021), the median infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19 (without vaccine intervention) has been determined to be 0.23% for all ages, and 0.05% (1 in 2000) for individuals under 70 years old.\n\nThe IFR for seasonal to pandemic flu, 0.1% to 0.67%, is similar to COVID-19 IFR\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s 0.23% infection fatality rate is in the middle of the range of IFR estimates for seasonal (~0.1%) to \u201cpandemic\u201d influenza (i.e., 0.67% for the 1957-\u201958 \u201cAsian flu\u201d pandemic).\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert Redfield, CDC Director (US), published a NEJM paper in late February correctly predicting \u201cthe overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968)\u201d.\n\nStudies: vaccines may actually be enhancing, not neutralizing, COVID variants and spread\n\nDisturbing trends from across the globe, especially in highly-vaccinated countries like Israel, Iceland, and the UK, suggest new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the fully vaccinated have been rising dramatically since about mid-July. The \u201cpandemic of the vaccinated\u201d phenomenon has just recently (August) begun making its way into the United States.\n\nWithin the last week, two more studies (Liu et al., 2021, Yahi et al., 2021) suggest the more recent variants (Delta) are resisting vaccine neutralization. Worse, current vaccines may not reduce, but they may even enhance COVID\u2019s Delta variant\u2019s infectivity by spawning more resistant mutations.\n\n\u201c[T]he emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may tip the scales in favor of infection enhancement. Our structural and modeling data suggest that it might be indeed the case for Delta variants\u201d [ ].\n\nFurthermore, \u201cboosters,\u201d or third shots, may actually \u201cboost enhancing anti-bodies\u201d more than neutralizing antibodies (Liu et al., 2021).\n\nIn other words, vaccines may be worsening the current COVID surge.\n\n\u201c85-90% of the hospitalizations are in fully vaccinated people\u201d\n\nIn late July Israeli Minister of Health data suggested the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness has fallen from the advertised >90% to 39%. It may be even lower now.\n\nHere are some recent headlines from across the globe documenting the burgeoning pandemic of the fully vaccinated.\n\nThe pandemic of the fully vaccinated has just recently begun permeating the United States. The percentage of new COVID cases and deaths represented by the fully vaccinated used to be in the low single digits in June and into July. In the last few weeks, however, in the USA\u2019s most vaccinated states (Oregon, Vermont, Massachusetts), 20-40% of new cases and deaths are fully vaccinated individuals.", "opengraph": {"type":
