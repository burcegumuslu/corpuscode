Chicken pox is the common name for the varicella-zoster virus, which causes a very itchy, highly-contagious skin rash. The virus most commonly affects children between the ages of 4\u201310, but chicken pox can also affect adults who have never had the virus and therefore are not yet immune to it. Luckily, there are many options for chicken pox treatment.\n\nHow is chicken pox treated? Fortunately most healthy children and adults who get chicken pox will not require much or any medical attention or chicken pox treatment. In most cases a chicken pox skin rash will go away on its own within about two weeks without any medications or other interventions. However, in severe cases the virus can cause symptoms that linger for months, or, rarely, other complications such as scarring or pneumonia.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfortunate enough to suffer from chicken pox symptoms for many weeks or even longer, there are a number of home remedies available for natural chicken pox treatment. These include things like taking soothing baths with oatmeal, applying anti-inflammatory products to the skin, and reducing body aches with essential oils. Treatments for chicken pox won\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d the virus or prevent it from spreading to other people, but they can be really helpful for reducing itching, scabbing, fever symptoms, risk for infection and permanent scarring of the skin.\n\nChicken pox is very contagious and spreads easily from person to person. Chicken pox can spread even without direct contact since the virus can travel through the air via tiny respiratory droplets that are breathed in. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with an infected person\u2019s skin fluids.\n\nChicken pox symptoms usually appear within about two to three weeks after someone comes into contact with the virus. The most common chicken pox symptoms include: (1)\n\u2022 Developing a red skin rash that is usually severely itchy and uncomfortable. The rash usually forms on the face, scalp, chest, back and, to a lesser extent, on the arms and legs. Typically a chicken pox rash will be active for about five days before the blisters fill with fluid, rupture, and then form scabs.\n\u2022 Fever that usually lasts under five days and can cause symptoms like a stiff neck, nausea, body aches, etc.\n\nRarely, someone will get chicken pox more than once; however, the vast majority of the time chicken pox only affects people one time (usually while they are a child).What are the biggest risk factors for developing chicken pox? These include:\n\u2022 Never having had chicken pox before, which means someone is not yet immune to the virus.\n\u2022 Having close contact with anyone who is infected or was recently infected (both children and adults).\n\u2022 Working in close contact with children, such as in a daycare or school.\n\u2022 Never having been vaccinated for chicken pox.\n\u2022 Being an infant or newborn whose mother never had chickenpox or the vaccine.\n\u2022 Having a weakened immune systems or taking immunosuppressing medications (such as steroids), which can include cancer treatments or treatment for HIV.\n\nPrevention is key when it comes to protecting yourself or your children from chicken pox. The most common way that someone gets chicken pox is through direct contact with another infected person\u2019s skin, such as through exposure to fluids that leak from chicken pox blisters. If possible, avoid direct contact with someone who has an active case of chicken pox.\n\nIf a child or adult with chicken pox is otherwise healthy, then most doctors will recommend simply staying home, resting, possibly taking an over-the-counter (OTC) painkiller to manage symptoms, and giving the virus time to pass. The vast majority of children and adults who do develop chicken pox will fully overcome the virus within several weeks and experience no long-term health problems as a result. However, when someone has a compromised immune system \u2014 for example, due to a history of another illness or from taking immunosuppressant drugs \u2014 there are certain serious complications that can be caused by chicken pox. (2)\n\nMedications and treatment might then be needed to prevent or manage complications, such as:\n\u2022 Deformities in developing fetuses when the mother is infected\n\nSome of the medications for chicken pox treatment that doctors may prescribe include: (3)\n\nThere is also a varicella-zoster vaccine available. If you choose to vaccinate, most health authorities recommend that children receive the chicken pox vaccine between 12 and 18 months of age. Older children, and even teens and adults, can also receive the vaccine at a later age if they have never had the virus, especially if they are in a high-risk group. For people over the age of 13 who have never had the virus and want to get the vaccine, they will need more than one dose (usually two) that are spread apart by four to eight weeks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to know that the chicken pox vaccine doesn\u2019t offer total protection from the virus. Some children, and adults, too, will still develop symptoms of chicken pox that can be treated by resting, soothing the skin and supporting the immune system.\n\nIn fact, varicella vaccination is not as effective as the natural immunity that develops from having the virus. (4) Plus, among otherwise healthy children, most cases of chicken pox are not severe and will heal without much intervention.\n\nIf you do choose to vaccinate, it\u2019s important to be aware of possible side effects so that you can recognize them if they occur and contact your health care provider.\n\nKeep in mind that the chicken pox vaccine is not approved for use by pregnant women, people with certain immune system conditions, or people who have allergies to microbes and antibiotics that are used in the vaccine.\n\nThis is the first rule of chicken pox treatment: The best thing to do when a chicken pox rash is healing is to leave the bumps, blisters and scabs alone, avoiding scratching the skin as much as possible. Picking at or scratching a chicken pox rash can actually make the rash worse, prolong symptoms, potentially lead to an infection, and/or contribute to increased skin scabbing and scarring. Some people choose to wear gloves over their hands, or put gloves on their children if they have a rash, in order to prevent unknowingly scratching their skin while they sleep.\n\nWhen skin becomes very itchy, swollen or red, gently apply a cool, damp compress to the skin throughout the day as a basic chicken pox treatment. Use a natural fabric like cotton and avoid putting ice or high heat directly on the skin.\n\nYou can reduce skin dryness and itchiness associated with chicken pox by keeping your skin moist and utilizing oatmeal\u2019s natural skin-calming qualities. Oatmeal has many natural soothing properties and helps relieve all types of irritation of the skin, including contact dermatitis and other causes of itchiness. (5)\n\nTry taking a warm (but not very hot) bath once or more daily and adding uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal (finely ground oats that form a powder to be used for soaking) to provide relief from itching. (6) Read directions in order to know how much colloidal oatmeal is best to use. Soak in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes or longer, if you\u2019d like. Another chicken pox treatment option is to apply topical colloidal oatmeal creams or lotions directly to your skin.\n\n4. Apply Honey, Baking Soda, Vinegar or Antihistamine Lotion to the Skin\n\nBaking soda is a widely available, inexpensive ingredient that is known to have anti-itch properties and help soothe skin inflammation. It may help to neutralize acids present in the skin and reduce irritation due to rashes. Baking soda can be applied in small amounts to itchy skin, but shouldn\u2019t be used if skin is broken, raw or bleeding.\n\nStart by adding about 1 teaspoon of baking soda to a small amount of warm water, either creating a paste or dissolving the baking soda, then dabbing it over the skin with a cloth. Leave the solution to set and dry. It\u2019s best to test a small section of your skin first to make sure it doesn\u2019t contribute to any type of painful reaction or worsened symptoms.\n\nReal, raw honey is another ingredient that is very beneficial for the skin, helping to calm inflammation, reduce the risk for scarring, and promote faster healing. (7) Purchase fresh, high-quality honey that has not been processed and heated to high temperatures, ensuring that its active ingredients are intact. To use honey on a chicken pox rash, coat the infected area of skin with a thin layer of gently warmed-up honey and then leave it to dry. Let the honey soak into the skin for at least 15 minutes. You can do this two to three times daily, in addition to adding honey to smoothies or teas to support your immune system.\n\nYet another ingredient that some people find effective for reducing skin itching and swelling is raw apple cider vinegar (ACV). You can either add about 1 cup of ACV to a bath, or use about 2\u20133 tablespoons mixed into a glass of water that you dab a cloth into and then gently apply to the skin. Just be careful that you don\u2019t ever apply ACV to broken skin or open wounds.\n\nNeem oil has many natural antiviral and antioxidant properties that help to soothe inflamed, swollen skin. It\u2019s known to help reduce itching, clustering of blisters, pain and scarring associated with many different rashes including chicken pox. (8) Azadirachtin is the most active component found in neem oil, along with other compounds like fatty acids and vitamin E. And because neem oil contains many antioxidants, such as carotenoids and quercetin, it\u2019s beneficial for overall skin health even after your rash is gone.\n\nTo use neem oil as a natural chicken pox treatment, combine about a half ounce of pure organic neem oil with 8 ounces of organic jojoba oil. Place your ingredients in a cosmetic container or small cosmetic bottle, mix well and then apply to the affected area of your skin liberally. You can use the solution on itchy skin about two or three times a day. Another option, if you\u2019re able to find neem leaves, is to mash a handful of leaves into a paste with a bit of boiling water. Wait about 10 minutes for the mixture to cool, then apply to your skin. Neem leaves can also be added to baths, just like essential oils or oatmeal.\n\nKeep in mind that you should not use undiluted neem oil on your skin as it can be very strong, so make sure to combine it with another carrier oil. It\u2019s recommended that you always try a very small amount on a patch of skin first to make sure you don\u2019t have any adverse reaction.\n\nLavender essential oil can be added to the neem/jojoba recipe above to further help provide relief from itching and promote skin healing. Lavender oil contains numerous active ingredients that soothe swelling, itching, redness and discomfort, plus it may help to prevent infections or scarring. It\u2019s been found to contain chemicals including linalyl acetate and linalool, which are considered to be very mild compounds with a long history of safely promoting wound healing and skin health. (9)\n\nSome people with chicken pox will develop a fever, feel nauseated or deal with vomiting, become dehydrated or lose their appetite. You can help prevent dehydration symptoms by drinking fluids throughout the day (especially lots of plain water or herbal tea) and by eating hydrating foods, in particular fruits and veggies.\n\nA bland diet is usually best to prevent nausea and vomiting while overcoming chicken pox, so try to avoid eating overly-processed, heavy or spicy foods. Eating nutrient-dense, healthy foods will enhance your immune system and boost your ability to help fight off the virus quickly. So, as much as possible, eat foods high in vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A and all sorts of antioxidants.\n\nIf sores develop inside your mouth due to chicken pox, then eat mostly soft, easily-digested foods that aren\u2019t so painful to swallow. Helpful foods and drinks to have while you\u2019re recovering from chicken pox include:\n\nTo give your immune system a boost and support recovery you can take the following antiviral herbs and supplements when you have chicken pox: (10)\n\n9. Take an Over-the-Counter Pain Medication If Needed\n\nIf your fever becomes very high or you experience other symptoms like body aches, headaches or a stiff neck, then you can take an OTC painkiller to relieve chicken pox discomfort. The safest options are acetaminophen or ibuprofen. But be aware that you should never take aspirin if you have chicken pox (or give it to your children), as this is associated with serious complications, including Reye\u2019s syndrome.\n\nNatural painkillers like peppermint essential oil or Epsom salts added to a warm soaking bath can help ease body aches and swelling. If your skin feels very inflamed and itchy, then you might also want to take an OTC antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Additionally, you can apply an OTC antihistamine lotion to itchy areas of the skin, such as calamine lotion (the pink lotion that is commonly used on mosquito bites).\n\nAs mentioned above, chicken pox treatment is usually straightforward and doesn\u2019t normally require medical intervention. There are certain circumstances, however, in which someone with chicken pox should get emergency care \u2014 for example, if the person is pregnant, nursing, immunodeficient or younger than 6 months old.\n\nTo reduce the risk for complications, it\u2019s important to visit a doctor or even the emergency room right away if you notice any of the following serious signs and symptoms associated with chicken pox complications:\n\u2022 A rash that develops into an infection, becoming very swollen, warm, tender or painful.\n\u2022 High fever (higher than 102 F or 38.9 C)\n\u2022 Severe vomiting, very stiff neck, dizziness, disorientation, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, or tremors.\n\u2022 Chicken pox is the common name for the varicella-zoster virus, which causes symptoms like a very itchy, highly-contagious skin rash, fever, abdominal pains, body aches, headaches and general discomfort.\n\u2022 Most of the time chicken pox will not need to be treated by a doctor; you can usually find relief with natural chicken pox treatment. However, sometimes complications are possible in which treatments like antiviral medications may be needed.\n\u2022 Use antiviral herbs and supplements to boost immune function.\n\u2022 If all else fails, or you have a fever, try OTC pain medicine.
