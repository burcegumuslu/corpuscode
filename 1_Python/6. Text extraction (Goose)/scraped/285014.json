UC Santa Barbara assistant professor of mechanical engineering Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz conducted an analysis of 2020 studies exploring the effects of different forms of UV radiation on the SARS-CoV-2 and found a significant discrepancy. As with all electromagnetic radiation, UV falls on a spectrum, with longer-wave UVA reacting differently with parts of DNA and RNA than other mid-range UVB waves contained in sunlight, which kill microbes and cause sunburn in humans. Short-wave UVC radiation has previously been shown to deactivate viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for Covid-19, but this section of the UV spectrum is deflected away by the Earth\u2019s ozone layer. A July 2020 experimental study tested the power of UV light on SARS-CoV-2, contained in simulated saliva, and found the virus was inactivated in under 20 minutes. However, a theory published a month later suggested sunlight could achieve the same effect, which didn\u2019t quite add up. This second study concluded that SARS-CoV-2 was three times more sensitive to UV radiation in sunlight than the influenza A virus. The vast majority of coronavirus particles were rendered inactive within 30 minutes of exposure to midday summer sunlight, whereas the virus could survive for days under winter sunlight. \u201cThe experimentally observed inactivation in simulated saliva is over eight times faster than would have been expected from the theory,\u201d Luzzatto-Feigiz and his team said. \u201cSo, scientists don\u2019t yet know what\u2019s going on.\u201d The team suspects that, as the UVC doesn\u2019t reach the Earth, instead of directly attacking the RNA, the long-wave UVA in sunlight interacts with molecules in the virus\u2019 environment, such as saliva, which speeds up the inactivation, in a process witnessed previously in wastewater treatment. The findings suggest UVA emitters could be added to equipment such as air filtration systems to provide a cheap and energy-efficient means of reducing the spread of viral particles. Masks and social distancing would more than likely still be required, but such UV-based interventions could be of some benefit as nations struggle with recurring waves of the pandemic despite vaccination efforts.\n\nSounds like a thousand other such warnings.\n\u2022 COVID-19 Will be Like a \u201cFond Caress\u201d in Comparison to Next Pandemic (SN)\n\nThey have now stopped using it for everybody. And at some point they will try to bring it back.\n\u2022 AstraZeneca Vaccine Suspended Again in Netherlands After Death (NTD)\n\nThe Netherlands temporarily suspended AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for a second time for people under the age of 60 after a woman who had received the jab died and four other women experienced serious complications, according to a report. The announcement to pause the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company\u2019s vaccine was made in a government statement on Friday, which said that due to \u201ca new report\u201d on side effects, health officials decided not to vaccinate people under the age of 60 in the coming days. The woman\u2019s death was reported by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb\u2014a research center that tracks the risks associated with the use of medicines. \u201cThese are women between 25 and 65 years old. Three patients had extensive pulmonary embolisms. One died and one also had a brain hemorrhage,\u201d Lareb said. \n\n Health officials said a link between the vaccine and the side effects has not yet been established but is being investigated. The complications arose about 7 to 10 days after the people received the vaccine. It is the first time someone died in the Netherlands after getting the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was previously suspended temporarily in multiple countries in the European Union over blood clot concerns, including in the Netherlands. Last month, the Netherlands\u2019s Health Ministry halted the administration of AstraZeneca for more than two weeks after serious side effects arose in a small number of people. Germany on Tuesday became the latest European country to also stop injecting people with the AstraZeneca vaccine under the age of 60 amid fresh concerns over unusual blood clots reported in a number of those who received the shots. France, meanwhile, also said in mid-March it decided to limit the vaccine to people for those aged 55 and older.\n\u2022 DeSantis Bans Vaccine Passports To Prevent Having Two Classes Of Citizens (RT)\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has banned Covid-19 vaccine passports in his state, signing an executive order and calling on lawmakers to protect citizens permanently. Conservatives reacted by backing him for president in 2024. The order, which the Republican governor signed on Friday, notes that Covid-19 vaccines are not required by law, and individual inoculation records are private health information. Requiring vaccine passports to access goods, services or activities would infringe individual freedom and invade privacy, DeSantis added in the order. \u201cRequiring so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life \u2013 such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant or going to a movie theater \u2013 would create two classes of citizens based on vaccination,\u201d DeSantis wrote. He said the order protects \u201cthe fundamental rights and privacies of Floridians and the free flow of commerce.\u201d No business or government entity is allowed under the order to require people in Florida to provide documentation of their vaccination status. State agencies will enforce the order, including compliance as a condition of state licensing and other authorization needed to do business, and companies that violate the ban won\u2019t be eligible for grants or state contracts. \u201cThe Legislature is working on making permanent these projections for Floridians, and I look forward to signing them into law,\u201d DeSantis said. The order comes amid a global debate over the ethics of forcing people to take vaccines to be able to live as full-fledged citizens and restore freedoms that arguably weren\u2019t legally infringed in the first place. For instance, South Korea\u2019s prime minister said on Thursday that only those who get Covid-19 jabs will be allowed to return to their \u201cdaily lives.\u201d The Biden administration so far has sidestepped the issue, coming down on the side of a two-tiered society but seeking to achieve it through the private sector \u2013 without government mandates. DeSantis is short-circuiting that effort, at least in one major state, and conservatives such as US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) have called on other Republican-led states to follow suit.\n\nMore than 70 British lawmakers have signalled their opposition to the introduction of so-called vaccine passports that the government is considering bringing in to help to open the economy as it starts lifting COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. The government is reviewing the idea of asking people to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination to access crowded spaces such as pubs or sports events, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson having already said that a certificate is likely to be needed for international travel. The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Saturday that trials of COVID passports would begin within weeks during pilots at major sports events and possibly a music awards ceremony in the next two months to assess their impact. On Friday Johnson said that a combination of immunity factors \u2013 if people have had the disease, a vaccination or had a COVID-19 test \u2013 would give businesses confidence. \u201cSo those three things working together will, I think, be useful for us as we as we go forward,\u201d Johnson said. But there has been mounting concern from some in his own Conservative Party, as well as opposition lawmakers and civil rights groups, about the prospect of vaccine certificates. \u201cWe oppose the divisive and discriminatory use of COVID status certification to deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs,\u201d said a statement signed by a group of more than 70 lawmakers from across the political spectrum. Under the government\u2019s planned \u201croadmap\u201d out of the pandemic, pubs will be allowed to serve people outdoors later this month, with a further easing of restrictions in mid-May before all measures are lifted near the end of June. Johnson suggested last month that some pubs might require customers to produce vaccine certificates. Culture minister Oliver Dowden, meanwhile, has said that such certificates could help get more people into theatres. No decision has yet been made and Johnson has instructed senior minister Michael Gove to review the possible role of certificates, saying there are deep and complex ethical issues to explore. Gove is due to report back shortly.\n\n\u201c\u201dI don\u2019t understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I don\u2019t need to do this in a supermarket..\u201d\n\u2022 Every Customer Must Sign In As Pubs Face Triple Whammy Of New Covid Rules (M.)\n\nPub bosses are warning that a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d of new Covid rules could be a further blow to landlords after months of closures. Every customer aged over 16 will be forced to sign in \u2013 rather than just one member of a big group as was the case last year. It is also unclear whether payment at the bar will be permitted. From April 12, pubs will be outdoors-only, and in rural areas particularly, poor broadband could make paying for drinks difficult if customers are not allowed inside. And hospitality bodies are also troubled by reports that the Government will introduce vaccine passports from June 21, requiring punters to have either been jabbed or provide proof of a negative test. UK Hospitality (UKH), the British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) and the British Institute of Innkeepers (BII) branded the measures as \u201cimpractical burdens\u201d. In a joint statement, the pub representatives said: \u201cGovernment has promised the country that we will be reopening but we are now being told that this will be with our hands tied behind our backs. \u201cIt now seems the hospitality industry could be burdened with vaccine passports, over-complicated test and trace rules and an inability not able to take payments indoors at reopening \u2013 a triple whammy for hard-pressed publicans who have been forcibly closed for months. \u201cPubs will already be trading at a loss when they reopen with all the existing restrictions and Covid-secure measures in place. \u201cAdding further disproportionate and discriminatory measures threatens the very survival of thousands of businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to single out our sector again with these added impractical burdens that will have economic consequences and risk our recovery.\u201d Carl Ford, an accountant based in Tamworth, told the BBC he was frustrated and confused by the rules. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s almost like going back to school where I have to sign in and out,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I don\u2019t need to do this in a supermarket where you have a free for all. People don\u2019t have to sign in and they can pick up fruit with their hands.\u201d Pubs will open beer gardens from April 12 with punters allowed indoors on May 17. A full reopening with no social distancing could be on the cards from June 21 when the Government hopes to have done away with all Covid rules.\n\nDo we still recognize how insane it is that a goverment \u201callows\u201d us to see people? Or are we too far gone for that?\n\u2022 Care Home Residents In England To Be Allowed Two Visitors From 12 April (G.)\n\nCare home residents in England will be allowed to receive two regular visitors from Monday 12 April, as Covid restrictions are eased further, Boris Johnson is to announce. Strict Department of Health guidance has severely curtailed the contact residents have had with their loved ones during the pandemic. Only one named visitor is currently permitted. Under guidance to be published next week, two people will be allowed to visit regularly, as long as they have a negative Covid test result. They will have to wear protective equipment, but will be allowed to hold their loved one\u2019s hand. Babies and children under the age of two will be excluded from the limit, so that elderly residents can meet new grandchildren or great-grandchildren. The prime minister said: \u201cReuniting family and friends has been a priority each time restrictions have eased, and the next step will be no different. \u201cI\u2019m particularly pleased to allow residents to have more visitors, including grandchildren, given the isolation and concern felt by so many this past year.\u201d A damning report from the cross-party public accounts committee of MPs in February highlighted dire shortages of PPE for care staff, and the fact that 25,000 people were discharged back into residential homes from hospitals in the first wave, some without being tested for the virus. The government is guaranteeing it will continue to provide free personal protective equipment to care homes until March next year. Almost 94% of care home residents have received at least the first dose of a vaccine, as have almost 78% of care staff. The government is considering plans to make the jab compulsory for staff, with an announcement expected in the coming days. Unions have warned against such a move, saying it could be discriminatory, urging employers to focus instead on encouraging their staff to be vaccinated. [..] Fiona Carragher, the director of research and influencing at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, welcomed the change in the visiting rules. \u201cVisits are vital to care home residents with dementia, who have been isolated from their loved ones, without the essential care and support their families so often provide, and as a result experienced a devastating increase in their dementia symptoms over the past year,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way since the first lockdown, and soon we hope to see the benefits from people with dementia being reunited with their loved ones.\u201d\n\nPfizer, Moderna, and other coronavirus vaccine makers have said repeatedly that they intend to hike prices on vaccines as early as this year, as the potential need for additional booster shots and future demand could lead to an unprecedented financial windfall. One estimate projects that if Pfizer raised the price of its coronavirus vaccine from $19.50 to $175 per dose, as one Pfizer executive recently suggested, and if every adult American were to take it, the cost would be $44.7 billion \u2014 nearly 10 percent of all U.S. drug spending. But the federal government, which funded crucial biomedical research to develop the patented messenger RNA technology behind the leading Covid-19 vaccines, is on the verge of eliminating a legal mechanism to control the prices of key medical products, including vaccines. Next week, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, will wrap up a comment period to modify the rules governing the Bayh-Dole Act, a law that regulates the transfer of federally funded inventions into commercial property. Under the current interpretation of the law, the government may \u201cmarch in\u201d and suspend the use of patents developed via government-funded inventions if it determines that the products are excessively priced. [..] IN THE TWILIGHT weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, his administration released a NIST rule designed to undercut the Bayh-Dole Act and weaken the government\u2019s authority to march in and seize control of a patent when drugmakers fail to make medicine \u201cavailable to the public on reasonable terms.\u201d That phrase has long been the law\u2019s most contentious provision. It invokes a term of art that multiple federal courts have ruled relates to pricing and market-related decisions. The legislative history of the Bayh-Dole Act includes arguments that clearly state pricing considerations as a factor in determining \u201creasonable terms.\u201d The proposed rule, however, tightens the law\u2019s definition to remove price as a factor \u2014 a change long demanded by industry. Joe Biden was vocal during the presidential campaign about his commitments to roll back his predecessor\u2019s most egregious industry-serving regulations and to bring down drug prices, but his administration has so far been mum about the Bayh-Dole Act rulemaking.\n\n\u201c..there will also be even less hallucinated capital (\u201cmoney\u201d) to loan out to this shrinking pool of borrowers\u201d\n\nFirst, the whole mass motoring racket is falling apart more on its financial model than on whether the cars move by gasoline or electricity. Americans are used to buying cars on installment loans, and, with the middle-class withering away, there are ever-fewer credit-worthy borrowers for those loans (for ever more expensive cars). Soon, as the debt markets groan and wobble under the weight of massive new debt, there will also be even less hallucinated capital (\u201cmoney\u201d) to loan out to this shrinking pool of borrowers. Second, the decrepit US electric grid can\u2019t handle the charging needs of such a gigantic electric car fleet (and fixing the grid alone would be a trillion-dollar project). Third, the manufacturing of electric cars depends on scarce rare mineral resources that are not readily available in the US, but controlled by foreign nations. Fourth, car-making utterly depends on far-flung international supply lines for parts and electronics in a time when the integrated global economy is cracking up under the strain of desperate competition for dwindling resources and the ill-will generated by that. There are yet more kinks in the electric car scheme but those are enough. Of course, this whole initiative is in the service of preserving a set of living arrangements that is going obsolete, namely, suburbia. The previous investment represented by all the housing subdivisions, commercial highway strips, malls, office parks, and super-highways pretty much drove the American economy since the Second World War. It\u2019s understandable that we would be desperate to keep it all running, and fix the pieces that are falling apart, because it\u2019s where we put most of our national wealth. It\u2019s the whole American Dream in one nifty package. And, it sure seemed like a good idea at the time, in such a big country, with so much cheap land, and all that oil. But now things have changed and reality is sending us clear signals that we have to live differently. The effort to oppose reality is apt to be ruinous for us.\n\n\u201cWhat is astonishing is that the media itself has fueled this false narrative and it is being used as a key claim in boycotting the state.\u201d\n\nWe recently discussed the false statement made repeatedly by President Joe Biden about the Georgia election law, which Biden has called \u201cJim Crow on steroids.\u201d Biden falsely claims that the law closes polling places earlier, a claim that even the Washington Post decried as false. Biden has not only repeated his earlier false claim but added a new one in supporting a boycott of the state of Georgia by Major League Baseball. It is a common false claim made about denying water under the law to people standing in line to vote. What is astonishing is that the media itself has fueled this false narrative and it is being used as a key claim in boycotting the state. During an interview on ESPN, Biden again declared the law as \u201cJim Crow on steroids\u201d and added: \u201cI think that today\u2019s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them, they\u2019re leaders. Look at what\u2019s happened with the NBA as well. Look at what\u2019s happened across the board. The people who\u2019ve been victimized the most are the people who are the leaders in these various sports and it\u2019s just not right. Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote, can\u2019t do that? C\u2019mon! Or you\u2019re going to close a polling place at 5 o\u2019clock when working people just get off? This is all about keeping working folks and ordinary folks that I grew up with from being able to vote.\u201d Indeed, it is hard to \u201cimagine\u201d because it is not true and the White House knows that it is not true. If a president is going to accuse a state of passing a Jim Crow law (let alone supporting a boycott), there is an expectation of a modicum of accuracy and fairness. Otherwise, it degrades not just the movement for voting rights but the Office of the Presidency itself. I will not repeat the clearly false claim about closing polling places early. As the Washington Post noted (and repeated after this latest interview), \u201cthe net effect [of the Georgia law] is \u2026 to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not limit them.\u201d The use of the provision to suggest a reduction in voting hours was a knowing misrepresentation by those seeking to justify the federalization of election laws in Congress. Despite being called out on the false statement, President Biden continues to repeat it. The water claim is equally disingenuous and false. The law does not prevent people from giving water to those standing in line. The law allows \u201cself-service water from an unattended receptacle\u201d for voters waiting in line. It also allows anyone to give water or food to any voters outside of limited area around the polling place.\n\nHunter\u2019s come out of hiding to promote his memoir \u201cBeautiful Things\u201d. You can\u2019t make that up.\n\n\u201cIt could be that I was hacked, it could be that it was Russian intelligence. It could be that it was stolen from me..\u201d\n\u2022 Hunter Biden Admits Laptop Could \u2018Certainly\u2019 Belong To Him (NYP)\n\nHunter Biden has finally \u2018fessed up that the laptop at the center of The Post\u2019s explosive expos\u00e9 last year \u201ccertainly\u201d could belong to him, he revealed in an interview Friday. In a sitdown with CBS\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d President Biden\u2019s embattled son was pointedly asked \u201cyes or no\u201d if the MacBook Pro that was dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop in April 2019 was in fact his. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what the answer is, that\u2019s the truthful answer,\u201d Hunter Biden said in an excerpt of the interview released on Friday, before adding, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d But asked whether it could have belonged to him, he replied, \u201cCertainly.\u201d \u201cCertainly, there could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be that I was hacked, it could be that it was Russian intelligence. It could be that it was stolen from me,\u201d he continued. Hunter Biden made the rare media appearance while promoting his new memoir, \u201cBeautiful Things,\u201d out April 6 from Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. In the final months of the heated 2020 presidential race, The Post revealed a trove of emails from Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop that raised questions about his then-candidate father\u2019s ties to his son\u2019s foreign business ventures, including Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company linked to corruption. The emails revealed that the younger Biden introduced a top Burisma executive to his father, then vice president, less than a year before the elder Biden admittedly pressured Ukrainian officials into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company. The never-before-revealed meeting is mentioned in a message of appreciation that Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma board adviser, sent Hunter on April 17, 2015. [..]In addition to his Ukrainian connections, other emails on the computer showed Hunter discussing potential business deals with China\u2019s largest private energy company. One deal seemed to spark considerable interest with the younger Biden, who called it \u201cinteresting for me and my family.\u201d\n\u2022 The Pending Collapse of the \u2018Rules-based International Order\u2019 (Ritter)\n\nIt seems a week cannot go by without US Secretary of State Antony Blinken bringing up the specter of the \u2018rules-based international order\u2019 as an excuse for meddling in the affairs of another state or region. The most recent crisis revolves around allegations that China has dispatched a fleet of more than 200 ships, part of a so-called \u2018maritime militia\u2019, into waters of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines. China says that these vessels are simply fishing boats seeking shelter from a storm. The Philippines has responded by dispatching military ships and aircraft to investigate. Enter Antony Blinken, stage right: \u201cThe United States stands with our ally, the Philippines, in the face of the PRC\u2019s maritime militia amassing at Whitsun Reef,\u201d Blinken tweeted. \u201cWe will always stand by our allies and stand up for the rules-based international order.\u201d Blinken\u2019s message came a mere 18 hours after he tweeted about his meeting in Brussels with NATO. \u201cOur alliances were created to defend shared values,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRenewing our commitment requires reaffirming those values and the foundation of international relations we vow to protect: a free and open rules-based order.\u201d What this actually means, of course, is that the order is rules-based so long as it is the nation called America that sets these rules and is accepted as the world\u2019s undisputed leader. Blinken\u2019s fervent embrace of the \u2018rules-based international order\u2019 puts action behind the words set forth in the recently published \u2018Interim National Security Strategy Guidance\u2019, a White House document which outlines President Joe Biden\u2019s vision \u201cfor how America will engage with the world.\u201d While the specific term \u2018rules-based international order\u2019 does not appear in the body of the document, the precepts it represents are spelled out in considerable detail, and conform with the five pillars of the \u201cliberal international order\u201d as set forth by the noted international relations scholars, Daniel Duedney and G. John Ikenberry, in their ground-breaking essay, \u2018The nature and sources of liberal international order\u2019, published by the Review of International Studies in 1999. The origins of this \u201cliberal international order\u201d can be traced back to the end of the Second World War and the onset of a Cold War between Western liberal democracies, helmed by the United States, and the communist bloc nations, led by the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. The purpose of this order was simple \u2013 to maintain a balance of power between the US-led liberal democracies and their communist adversaries, and to maintain and sustain US hegemony over its liberal democratic allies. This was accomplished through five basic policy \u2018pillars\u2019: Security co-binding; the embrace of US hegemony; self-limitation on the part of US allies; the politicization of global economic institutions for the gain of liberal democracies; and Western \u201ccivil identity.\u201d\n\nThe line in the sand.\n\u2022 Russia Warns NATO Against Sending Any Troops To Ukraine (ZH)\n\nWe try to run the Automatic Earth on donations.
