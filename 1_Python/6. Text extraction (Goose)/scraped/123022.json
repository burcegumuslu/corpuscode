It polled almost 18,500 unvaccinated people worldwide between September 2021 and February 2022, with the largest number of respondents coming from Europe, North America and Australasia. The poll asked questions about the respondents\u2019 health during the period, with the participants sending their answers on a monthly basis.\n\nThe greatest incidence of COVID-19 disease was reported in the cohort aged between 50 and 69, with the highest rate of 12.3 percent in January. Interestingly, those 70 years old and up were least affected by COVID-19 at 1.3 percent. The 20- to 40-year-old cohort had 10.7 percent incidence rate, while those aged between one and 19 years old only registered a 3.8 percent rating.\n\nTen percent of the respondents infected with COVID-19 were asymptomatic, while the remaining 90 percent showed symptoms of sickness. Of the symptomatic cohort, 57 percent had mild symptoms and 35 percent had moderate symptoms. Only eight percent showed severe symptoms.\n\nMost symptoms reported by the respondents who got sick with COVID-19 included tiredness, cough, aches, fever, loss of taste and/or smell, difficulty breathing and diarrhea.\n\nJust 0.4 percent of the respondents said they were hospitalized as either in-patients or out-patients. Of the respondents hospitalized for COVID-19, 20 percent did not need to stay overnight; 55 percent where hospitalized for less than three days; and 28 percent were confined for two weeks or more. (Related: Study: Unvaccinated individuals are not a burden to medical systems.)\n\nUnvaxxed suffered more from discrimination than infection\n\nThe survey\u2019s findings insinuated that the unvaccinated respondents, by virtue of their natural immunity, were minimally impacted by COVID-19. Tyranny and discrimination due to their vaccination status left more serious damages.\n\nTerminations due to noncompliance with COVID-19 vaccine mandates were greatest in Australia and New Zealand at 29 percent, followed by 13 percent in North America, which includes the United States and Canada.\n\nBetween 20 and 50 percent of respondents worldwide reported being personal targets of hate because of their vaccination status. Almost 45 percent reported \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201csevere\u201d mental health issues arising from discrimination over their health choices.\n\nMoreover, between 57 and 61 percent of respondents based in Southern Europe, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South America reported being victimized by their own governments.\n\nThe respondents also elaborated on their reasons for refusing the COVID-19 shot. They cited preference for natural medicine, distrust of Big Pharma, distrust of government information, poor or limited clinical trial data for the shots and fear of long-term adverse reactions.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of respondents \u2013 71 percent \u2013 reported taking supplements such as vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and quercetin alongside antivirals like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). There was a substantial bias toward hospitalization for survey participants who did not take these supplements.\n\n\u201cThe findings suggest that opting out of the world\u2019s largest medical experiment, relying on natural immunity, self-care with supplements and/or ivermectin or HCQ, appeared to contribute to low incidences of severe disease, hospitalization or death,\u201d the researchers concluded.\n\n\u201cPublic dialogue about the touted \u2018safety and effectiveness\u2019 of vaccines, contrasted with strategies to enhance immune resilience, all in the context of authoritarianism versus autonomy, self-care, personal responsibility and freedom of choice is needed.\u201d\n\nMedicalFascism.news has more stories about the discrimination experienced by the unvaccinated.\n\nWatch this fighter pilot testify about the discrimination faced by unvaccinated service members in the U.S. military.\n\nThis video is from the GalacticStorm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nDISCRIMINATION: Nurses with natural immunity to covid no longer welcome at American hospitals.\n\nDesperate for help: In stunning reversal, Italy decides to allow \u201cunvaccinated\u201d medical professionals to work.\n\nEmployers who follow vaccine mandates are violating their non-discrimination clause, says Paul Romero \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nIn NYC, the unvaccinated are condemned and segregated as the new sub-human class \u2026 in a society now rooted in medical discrimination and hateful bigotry.", "opengraph": {"title": "Global survey: Unvaxxed avoided COVID-19 vaccine fallout, but fell victim to government tyranny", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2022-09-27-global-survey-unvaxxed-suffered-tyranny-not-covid.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "A global survey found that those who did not get injected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine did not suffer from infection, but from government tyranny.
