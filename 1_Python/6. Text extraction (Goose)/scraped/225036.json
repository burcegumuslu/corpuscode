(China coronavirus archive here.)\n\nOne of those technologies is: DNA insertion.\n\nThe reference is the New York Times, 3/10/15, \u201cProtection Without a Vaccine.\u201d It describes the frontier of research. Here are key quotes that illustrate the use of synthetic genes to \u201cprotect against disease,\u201d while changing the genetic makeup of humans. This is not science fiction:\n\n\u201cBy delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [experimental] monkeys, the scientists are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019The sky\u2019s the limit,\u2019 said Michael Farzan, an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the new study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first human trial based on this strategy \u2014 called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer, or I.G.T. \u2014 is underway, and several new ones are planned.\u201d [That was nearly five years ago.]\n\n\u201cI.G.T. is altogether different from traditional vaccination. It is instead a form of gene therapy. Scientists isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain diseases and then synthesize artificial versions. The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle.\u201d\n\nHere is the punchline: \u201cThe viruses invade human cells with their DNA payloads, and the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient\u2019s own DNA. If all goes well, the new genes instruct the cells to begin manufacturing powerful antibodies.\u201d\n\nRead that again: \u201cthe synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient\u2019s own DNA.\u201d\n\nThe Times article taps Dr. David Baltimore for an opinion:\n\n\u201cStill, Dr. Baltimore says that he envisions that some people might be leery of a vaccination strategy that means altering their own DNA, even if it prevents a potentially fatal disease.\u201d\n\nYes, some people might be leery. If they have two or three working brain cells.\n\nThis is genetic roulette with a loaded gun.\n\nAnd the further implications are clear. Vaccines can be used as a cover for the injections of any and all genes, whose actual purpose is unannounced.\n\nThe emergence of this Frankenstein technology is paralleled by a shrill push to mandate vaccines, across the board, for both children and adults. The pressure and propaganda are planet-wide.\n\nThe freedom and the right to refuse vaccines has always been vital. It is more vital than ever now.\n\nWhat does wall to wall propaganda about an \u201cominous epidemic\u201d achieve? You have one answer. If it doesn\u2019t immediately pop into your head, read this article again.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
