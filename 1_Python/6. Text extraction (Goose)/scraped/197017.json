And this all happened under the direction and leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appeared to be a friend of President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cHe congratulated Biden, but after that, we got a little suspect,\u201d Lindell told Willis concerning Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cRight now with the vaccine over there, they are making the whole country take it so you can\u2019t go in shopping malls, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job, and if this happens, it\u2019s \u2026 the worst thing that could happen to this world.\u201d\n\nLindell then started talking about how the vaccine is \u201cmark of the beast stuff,\u201d both in terms of what it contains and how it is being implemented. He also started to go off on the stupidity of \u201cdouble masking,\u201d which is right around the time the MyPillow head was silenced by Willis and RSBN, supposedly to avoid the YouTube censors.\n\n\u201cI hate to do it,\u201d Willis told Lindell after censoring him. \u201cYou know I love you, but due to YouTube\u2019s guidelines, we will get our whole platform shut down if you talk about vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, this is over in Israel,\u201d Lindell rebutted.\n\n\u201cI know. We love you; we love you,\u201d was all Willis could say in response.\n\nWilliam Turton, a reporter at Bloomberg News, was quick to tweet about Lindell\u2019s statements, accusing him of \u201cspreading conspiracy theories about the coronavirus.\u201d Others did the same for damage control.\n\nLindell also spoke to Mediaite\u2018s Aidan McLaughlin about the stolen 2020 election, corruption at Fox News, and other relevant topics. The mainstream media mocked him for it while highlighting the fact that Dominion Voting Systems is suing Lindell for $1.3 billion.\n\nTwitter also banned Lindell not long after the Capitol \u201cinsurrection\u201d because of his support for Trump, which is now considered to be \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nFrom all sides, including RSBN, Lindell is under attack, as are all other American patriots who believe in free and fair elections. RSBN is sadly beholden to the \u201crules\u201d of YouTube \u2013 by choice, mind you \u2013 which are ever-changing and selectively applied.\n\nRSBN is apparently trying to appease its oppressor by censoring guests like Lindell, but this strategy will never work. In the end, YouTube will censor RSBN for whatever reason it feels like, and if the network is unprepared and has no plans to migrate elsewhere, it could be taken completely off guard.\n\n\u201cI understand that it is all about money and their platform is on YouTube,\u201d wrote one 100percentfedup.com commenter about RSBN. \u201cBut they clearly didn\u2019t learn anything from Parler.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to make efforts NOW to change their format to move to a different setup. Allowing YouTube to censor the truth just because you don\u2019t want to lose your cash cow is akin to pretending you are a good citizen because you donate to charity even though you know that charity is engaged in something horrific like child abuse or human trafficking.\u201d\n\nMore related news about mainstream and independent media censorship can be found at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Right Side Broadcasting censored MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell for warning about coronavirus vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2021-03-02-right-side-censored-mike-lindell-coronavirus-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, was muted during a Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN) interview on Sunday after he started warning Americans not to take the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine.
