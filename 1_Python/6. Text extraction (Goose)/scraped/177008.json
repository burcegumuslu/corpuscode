Your \u2018joke\u2019 is ignorant. The fact is that the success of our vaccination drive is exactly because every citizen of Israel\u2014Jewish, Muslim, Christian\u2014is entitled [to] it. Apologize!\u201d\n\nIsrael Nitzan, who serves as the country\u2019s consul general in New York, slammed SNL for \u201cSpreading anti-Semitic lies and misinformation. Fanning the flames just to get a laugh is not only wrong; it\u2019s irresponsible. Israel has made the vaccine available for its entire population equitably, regardless of gender, race or religion.\u201d\n\nA furious American Jewish Committee began circulating a petition on Sunday demanding that SNL apologize for the joke.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s joke isn\u2019t just untrue\u2014it\u2019s dangerous, a modern twist on a classic anti-Semitic trope that has inspired the mass murder of countless Jews throughout the centuries,\u201d the AJC petition said.\n\nEllie Cohanim, the deputy special envoy to combat anti-Semitism in the Trump administration, tweeted, \u201cUnder the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority is responsible for all health and social welfare needs. Contact SNL and NBC and demand they apologize for their modern-day blood libel against Jews.\u201d\n\nPro-Israel advocacy group StandWithUs launched an apology-demanding campaign, as well.\n\n\u201cThis may have been an uninformed comment, lacking in understanding of Israel\u2019s diverse population or, worse, a blood-libel and a lie dressed up and played for laughs,\u201d the petition read.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s healthcare system is available and equal to all and an example of coexistence. Those who allege otherwise tend to be extremist groups, who have already relished this \u2018joke\u2019 on social media.\n\n\u201cThe SNL libel has already been used to promote anti-Semitic words and deeds. \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 and NBC should apologize and disown this dangerous and misleading assertion.\u201d\n\nThe Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (CAMERA) also called on NBC to apologize for the anti-Semitic segment.\n\nCAMERA\u2019s Israel Director Tamar Sternthal urged \u201cNBC and SNL to apologize for the blatant anti-Semitic smear, and to make clear that Israel is providing equal access to the coronavirus vaccine for its entire population, Jews and non-Jews alike.\u201d\n\nRabbi Aryeh Spero, president of the U.S.-based Conference of Jewish Affairs, issued a statement saying, \u201cThe producers of \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 decided they would sacrifice the truth and demonize the Jewish State for the sake of a cheap laugh or, worse, enable an age old blood libel accusing Jews of manufacturing and spreading plagues while being indifferent to others.\n\n\u201cSurely [SNL creator Lorne] Michaels knows of the heroic efforts Israel has made in creating vaccines, medicines, and state-of-the art medical equipment to alleviate not only the coronavirus but also every type of disease found across the globe. The \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 crew would do best to educate themselves on how Israel, matched only by the United States, has sent its transportable medical units immediately to every part of the globe facing a meteorological or medical catastrophe.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 crew would never be this callous, nor stereotype a Muslim or LTGBQ group. They know that in today\u2019s culture, such demonization would get them cancelled and removed from media outlets.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jewish groups outraged by SNL \u2018joke\u2019 about Israel only vaccinating Jews", "description": "\u201cThe \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 libel has already been used to promote anti-Semitic words and deeds.
