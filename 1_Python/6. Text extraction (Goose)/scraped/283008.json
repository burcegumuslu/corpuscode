Pay Pal\u2019s sudden and unexplained action against our donors comes in the middle of our annual end-of-year fundraising campaign.\u201d2\n\nPayPal\u2019s attack against them is the culmination of Big Tech\u2019s attempts to silence the nonprofit. After NVIC held its Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination \u2014 Protecting Health & Autonomy in the 21st Century \u2014 in October 2020, they were increasingly targeted by mainstream media and a \u201cpolitical operative in the U.K.\u201d During 2021, they were eliminated from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube \u2014 yet their resolve to share the truth hasn\u2019t wavered.\n\nThe same is true following PayPal\u2019s announcement that they had cancelled NVIC\u2019s account. It didn\u2019t stop NVIC \u2014 the nonprofit simply secured a new secure platform for donations. They announced December 24, 2021:3\n\n\u201cJust as we pivoted in early 2021 to establish our presence on new social media platforms, NVIC has quickly established a secure alternative to PayPal for processing your credit card donations \u2026 NVIC is being heavily censored because we have spoken the truth about vaccination, health and autonomy for 40 years.\n\nWhile big tech and the forced vaccination lobby put out a steady supply of authoritarian propaganda promoting fear and hatred of those who engage in rational thinking, NVIC will continue to defend the legal right to make voluntary choices about vaccination without being punished for the choice made as we move forward with our mission to prevent vaccine injuries and deaths through public education and defend the informed consent ethic.\u201d\n\nThe press following PayPal\u2019s cancellation worked against the tech giant, as it prompted NVIC supporters to help in response. As Attkisson explained:4\n\n\u201cThe National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is one of the many fact-based advocacy groups that has suffered under the heavy hand of censorship from Big Tech acting on behalf of pharmaceutical/government/corporate interests. But victory can be found in a strategy that turns the censorship on its head.\n\nIf Americans can use censorship as a cue or guide to seek more information about that topic, person, or study, they defeat the intent of the censors.\n\nAfter NVIC was dumped from PayPal so that donations from supporters could not be processed during a crucial fundraising campaign, the nonprofit announced it had established a presence on an alternative fundraising platform. And the American people responded. NVIC has announced receiving substantial donations and support on the new platform, in part due to the attention the PayPal censorship gave to the issue.\u201d\n\nIn October 2021, self-proclaimed \u201cmedia watchdog\u201d group Media Matters accused PayPal and GoFundMe of \u201chosting crowdfunding campaigns for organizations that spread harmful COVID-19 misinformation.\u201d5\n\nSome of the organizations mentioned in the article include the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), America\u2019s Frontline Doctors and Children\u2019s Health Defense, which have been speaking out about early COVID-19 treatments and red flags about censorship since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nDefining them as \u201cgroups known for spreading medical misinformation,\u201d the article, which itself is spreading misinformation, then calls out PayPal\u2019s policies that do not allow users to \u201cprovide false, inaccurate or misleading information,\u201d among others.6\n\nIn short, people and organizations are being censored, deplatformed and banned from social media and payment processing platforms for the crime of spreading \u201cmisinformation,\u201d the meaning of which can change from day to day and from platform to platform.\n\nIn July 2021, Reuters also reported that PayPal planned to research transactions that fund hate groups, anti-government organizations and extremists. It\u2019s unclear, however, how they define these terms or the groups that fall under them.7\n\nIt\u2019s a modern-day witch hunt, whereby the U.S. Department of Homeland Security even lists promulgating \u201cfalse narratives\u201d around COVID-19 as a top national security threat, which basically puts a \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d target on the backs of those of us who have been identified as the most prolific \u201csuperspreaders\u201d of COVID-19 misinformation, whatever that \u201cmisinformation\u201d happens to be.\n\nIn the case of OCA, which was also suddenly dropped by PayPal, it was said that they violated the company\u2019s \u201cacceptable use\u201d policies. In a message to their subscribers and donors, OCA put it bluntly: \u201cWe are under attack.\u201d They continued:8\n\n\u201cLast week PayPal, our credit card processor for hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations, (and recurring donations) cut off all of our accounts (OCA, Regeneration International, and Citizens Regeneration Lobby) with no notice, claiming that we were violators of PayPal\u2019s \u201cacceptable use\u201d policies.\n\nThis outrageous attack on OCA\u2019s fundraising is similar to the intimidation and censorship carried out by other Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook, who have threatened to cut off OCA and Millions Against Monsanto from our two million social media followers, unless we stop talking about the origins, nature, virulence, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19.\n\nSubsequently we have been forced to put out two different versions of our weekly newsletter, Organic Bytes, one uncensored for our subscribers, one censored for distribution on social media. Needless to say OCA will not back down from our investigative reporting, our denunciations of corporate and government corruption and crime, and our truth-telling regarding genetic engineering and COVID-19.\n\nWe are exploring litigation against PayPal with lawyers and allied organizations who support free speech and truth-telling.\u201d\n\nLike NVIC, OCA wasn\u2019t deterred by PayPal\u2019s act of censorship; they simply switched to another credit card processor to continue on with their mission, despite the ongoing attempts at government intimidation and Big Tech censorship.\n\nMany may not be aware of the close ties between PayPal\u2019s early employees, who came to be known as the \u201cPayPal Mafia,\u201d and big names in the tech industry today. As reported by Insider, \u201cThe payments company \u2014 launched as Confinity in 1998 by Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, and Luke Nosek \u2014 grew to become a Silicon Valley giant.\n\nIt was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion in a deal that altered Silicon Valley history and helped spawn the careers of some of tech\u2019s most famous names.\u201d9 This includes:10\n\u2022 Palantir \u2014 This data analytics software company was founded by Thiel in 2003; the idea came from his experiences with credit card fraud at PayPal.\n\u2022 Affirm \u2014 This company allows people shopping online to pay for products over time using an instant line of credit. It was founded in 2013 by Max Levchin, one of PayPal\u2019s cofounders.\n\u2022 YouTube \u2014 YouTube founders Steve Chen and Chad Hurley worked at PayPal during its early days.\n\u2022 SpaceX \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s banking company X.com merged with Thiel\u2019s company Confinity to become PayPal in 2001. Not only is Musk a former PayPal CEO, but he made $165 million when PayPal sold, which was used to start SpaceX.\n\u2022 LinkedIn \u2014 LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Reid Hoffman, was a former executive vice president at PayPal.\n\nPayPal terminating nonprofits is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Big Tech and its censorship of the information you see daily on the internet. Efforts to shut down public discussions and information are in full force, while Big Tech is also actively manipulating what you can and can\u2019t see online, to the extent that they can alter perceptions of reality.\n\nZachary Vorhies, a former senior software engineer at Google and Google\u2019s YouTube, uncovered more than 950 pages of confidential Google documents showing a plan to re-rank the entire internet based on Google\u2019s corporate values, using machine learning to intervene for \u201cfairness.\u201d\n\nHe resigned in June 2019 and turned over the documents to the Department of Justice, then released them to the public via Project Veritas to expose Google\u2019s censorship activities.11 Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, made pushing down \u201cfake news\u201d and increasing \u201cauthoritative news\u201d sound like a good thing, Attkisson reported,12 but when Vorhies looked at Google\u2019s design documents, the fake news they were censoring wasn\u2019t really fake.\n\n\u201cI was apolitical,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I started to think, is this really fake news? Why are they defining it as fake news in order to justify censorship?\u201d Part of this involved Google\u2019s efforts at social reconstruction to correct \u201calgorithmic unfairness,\u201d which could be any algorithm that reinforces existing stereotypes.\n\nCould objective reality be algorithmically unfair? Google says yes. Vorhies used the example of doing a Google search for CEOs, and the images returned included mostly men. Although it\u2019s reality, this could be considered algorithmically unfair and, according to Google, justifies intervention in order to fix it. He also uses the example of the autofill search recommendations that pop up if you do a Google search.\n\nAutofill is what happens when you start typing a search query into a search engine and algorithms kick in to offer suggestions to complete your search. If you type \u201cmen can,\u201d you may get autofill recommendations such as \u201cmen can lactate\u201d and \u201cmen can get pregnant,\u201d or \u201cwomen can produce sperm\u201d \u2014 things that represent an inversion of stereotypes and a reversal of gender roles.\n\nWe\u2019ve been led to believe that whatever the autofill recommendations are is what most people are searching for \u2014 Google has stated that the suggestions given are generated by a collection of user data \u2014 but that\u2019s not true, at least not anymore.\n\nFLCCC Was Also Canceled by PayPal\n\nIn another example of Big Tech and PayPal\u2019s overreach, they also shut down FLCCC\u2019s donation platform October 15, 2021, \u201cin violation of PayPal\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy.\u201d13 \u201cBig tech must think we\u2019re having a big impact,\u201d FLCCC tweeted. \u201cWe are.\u201d14 But again, it\u2019s not only PayPal \u2014 this is an orchestrated effort by Big Tech, in concert with government, media, intelligence agencies and other forces. As FLCCC reported:15\n\n\u201cThese attacks join LinkedIn and Vimeo, which removed our accounts, and YouTube, which began taking down our testimonial videos months ago. The powerful forces of Big Tech, Big Pharma, government, health authorities, and mainstream media continue to suppress us. There is nothing false in anything that we post.\n\nThis is an attack on our ability to fundraise, our free speech, and our efforts to share effective, safe COVID-19 prevention and treatment protocols to help people around the world stay out of the hospital \u2014 and to save precious lives impacted by this dangerous virus.\u201d\n\nWhat can you do? Fight back against the heavy hand of censorship by beating them at their own game. Instead of ignoring, fearing or abandoning the information that is being targeted with censorship, do as Attkisson suggested \u2014 use censorship as a cue or guide that you should delve more deeply into the topic at hand to reveal the underlying truth.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Paypal Terminates Service For Nonprofits Fighting Vaccine Mandates", "description": "Technocracy's coup d'\u00e9tat expands as Big Tech financial companies like Paypal drop organizations who oppose the Technocrat narrative.
