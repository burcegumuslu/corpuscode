When I was in medical school in the late \u201870s, I was on the front cover for the national medical student handbook. I\u2019m sharing this photo with you that shows me administering a vaccine. At that time and for the next 15 years, I rigidly followed all vaccine guidelines.\n\nEven when I started seeing patients at my own clinic, I never once questioned the safety of any vaccine and I rejected information from people voicing their concerns. In the late \u201880s, one particular kind patient of mine, a mother, patiently shared a personal testimony about her vaccine-injured son, Jack.\n\nShe opened my eyes to a reality that I was previously unaware of and did not want to accept. She confronted me with clinical data that I could no longer ignore. In the years that followed, I saw more and more parents who had serious fears about certain vaccines; I slowly came to the realization that informed consent was practically nonexistent and there were serious medical risks being covered up by pharmaceutical companies and the federal government.\n\nWe are now in the midst of vaccine mandates that have affected nearly every person on the planet. If you don\u2019t know someone personally who has suffered a reaction to these vaccines, you are likely in the minority.\n\nVictims of Adverse Vaccine Reactions Need To Be Heard\n\nSheryl Ruettgers, who is the wife of former Green Bay Packers offensive lineman Ken Ruettgers, is among those who have suffered severe adverse effects from a COVID-19 injection.\n\nFour days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 shot in January 2021, Sheryl experienced a severe neurological reaction. She is still experiencing muscle pain, numbness, weakness and paresthesia that inhibit her daily activities.1 When she connected on social media with others who had been injured by the injections, the private pages were shut down.\n\nAfter connecting with doctors, nurses and other individuals who had experienced firsthand accounts of adverse reactions, the group wrote a letter to Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It stated:2\n\nThe group received no response from federal officials, which led Ken to start the website C19 Vax Reactions,3 for people to share their stories. There you can read over 500 real testimonies of adverse reactions to the shots and view dozens of videos detailing individuals\u2019 reactions.\n\nIn one example, 17-year-old Everest Romney received his first dose of the Pfizer shot, and experienced extreme swelling in his arm and neck that night.4 Two days later, the previously healthy athlete was unable to lift his head due to the pain and swelling. A pediatrician dismissed the concerns, blaming them on a sports injury.\n\nHis mother insisted on a CT scan, which revealed a blood clot inside his jugular vein on the same side he got the shot. Rare blood clots in his brain were also later revealed. He ended up in the ICU, where doctors still refused to acknowledge that the clots could be linked to the shot.\n\nAdverse Reactions Are Being Ignored\n\nMedical observations from doctors, nurses, first responders, general practitioners and other medical professionals regarding negative vaccine reactions are also included at C19 Vax Reactions. For example, Karen W. stated:5\n\nThis is the type of data that need to be collected, analyzed and studied in the midst of this unprecedented injection campaign, but instead those who speak out are silenced or discredited. Kyle Warner, a 29-year-old professional mountain bike racer, developed pericarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and reactive arthritis following his second dose of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 shot.8\n\nAn ER doctor refused to believe it was an adverse reaction to the jab and instead blamed it on a \u201cpsychotic episode.\u201d At the Real, Not Rare rally held in Washington, D.C., Warner spoke before politicians to make a difference in the support level for vaccine-injured people \u2014 which is nonexistent in the U.S. \u2014 and voice opposition to vaccine mandates.\n\nTheir mission is to gain acknowledgment from elected officials and federal health agencies of vaccine adverse reactions and raise awareness within the medical community about these reactions. The Real, Not Rare website has also collected dozens of stories from people who have been injured by COVID-19 shots.9 They also want to stop the denial of certain vaccine exemptions and stop vaccine mandates:10\n\nIn a second letter to the CDC and FDA, dated September 4, 2021, the \u201cever-growing group of Americans who have suffered severe and ongoing neurological adverse reactions\u201d to the COVID-19 shots, asked for acknowledgement that these reactions exist. \u201cUntil you acknowledge us, we simply do not exist,\u201d they wrote, adding:11\n\nFour Categories of Adverse Events Described\n\nWhile health officials remain silent about COVID-19 injection reactions, the growing number of reports cannot be silenced forever. A board-certified internist and cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough12 detailed the nonfatal syndromes that are occurring after COVID-19 shots, which cause symptoms similar to that of long COVID in many cases. The shot-induced syndromes fall into four areas, the first being cardiac.\n\nIn addition to myocarditis, a recognized adverse reaction to the shots, atrial fibrillation in young people and pericarditis can also occur post-COVID-19 shot. The second category of shot-induced syndromes is neurologic, which causes neurological symptoms similar to those among COVID-19 long haulers, as well as additional, more serious, effects. This includes Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can be fatal, bell\u2019s palsy, seizures, persistent headaches and blood clots in the brain.\n\nThe third category is immunologic, which includes suppression of lymphocyte count and reactivation of other viral syndromes, including Epstein-Barr virus and shingles. The fourth category \u2014 hematologic \u2014 occurs about two weeks after the shot and describes vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nSigns include bruising all over the body, bleeding from the gums and nose and dark urine. If you notice these signs in the weeks after receiving a COVID-19 injection, get to a hospital immediately.\n\nFor those suffering from these shot-induced syndromes, the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Working Group\u2019s I-RECOVER13 protocol for long-haul COVID syndrome has been used to treat shot-induced symptoms with similar success. The protocol can be downloaded in full,14 giving you step-by-step instructions on how to treat reactions from COVID-19 injections.\n\nLet Your Voice Be Heard\n\nI am dedicated now more than ever to individuals and families who have been injured by these vaccines. They were not informed of the risks. They believed what they were told \u2014 that the vaccines were safe and effective. These people\u2019s lives have been changed forever. They have been isolated, unsupported and shamed; wading through grief in the wake of vaccine mandates established \u201cfor the greater good.\u201d\n\nThe more devoted I became in supporting the ethical principal of informed consent to medical risk-taking \u2014 which includes the legal right to make voluntary decisions about getting an experimental injection \u2014 the more the attacks from the media, the government and pharmaceutical companies were compounded.\n\nPeople recognize truth when they see and hear it. We are united in our philosophical opposition to government health officials intimidating, threatening, and coercing citizens to violate their conscientiously-held beliefs. Censorship is pervasive; big tech has colluded with dictators and pharmaceutical companies to bury the harms occurring through these experimental vaccines, including death.\n\nIf you want your voice to be heard, I will help you share your testimony. Vaccine mandates have led to injuries, devastation and deaths \u2014 while the brainwashing \u201cget your vaccine now\u201d campaign is being used to divide and conquer.\n\nOne parent\u2019s personal grief shared with me nearly 30 years ago changed my life and opened my eyes. One spark is all that is required to start a fire. There is a revolution building \u2014 a revolution for freedom to live your life without medical mandates or dictators calling the shots.\n\nPlease share your story with us, and encourage others you know who have a story to share theirs. It\u2019s never been more important than now, for you and your family, to take control of your health.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccine Victims Share Adverse Reactions, Loss of Loved Ones | Dr. Joseph Mercola", "description": "Vaccine mandates have led to injuries, devastation and deaths \u2014 while the brainwashing \u201cget your vaccine now\u201d campaign is being used to divide and conquer", "url": "http://consciouslifenews.com/vaccine-victims-share-adverse-reactions-loss-of-loved-ones-dr-joseph-mercola/11209838/", "site_name": "Conscious Life News", "article:author": "slykush2377", "article:tag": "COVID vaccines risks", "article:section": "Hazards, Issues & Diseases", "article:published_time": "2021-11-28T06:00:00-08:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-27T17:47:38-08:00", "updated_time": "2021-11-27T17:47:38-08:00", "image": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dr-mercola-call-for-covid-19-vaccine-injury-testimonials.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dr-mercola-call-for-covid-19-vaccine-injury-testimonials.jpg"}, "tags": ["COVID vaccines", "COVID vaccine victims", "COVID vaccine adverse reactions", "COVID vaccines risks"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-11-28T06:00:00-08:00"}
