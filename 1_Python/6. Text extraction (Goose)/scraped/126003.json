The results came back that I was borderline diabetic with a reading of 6.3. After hearing Dr. Marik\u2019s testimony on berberine, I started taking 1000/mg of berberine daily. This is MyStory.\u201d\n\nIn August 2022, after battling an extreme flare-up of ME, a friend suggested ivermectin to Jenni-May. Over the next few months, her health improved from 30% to 50%. She took ivermectin again in December 2022, when she contracted COVID, and by day 10 she was in the best health she had been in for many years. She\u2019s now at 90% and is totally thrilled and grateful to be experiencing this level of quality of life. Watch this lovely MyStory now.\n\n\u201cMy Wife was Isolated, Drugged and Dying in Hospital. An AMA Exit was our Only Choice\u201d When you\u2019ve smuggled ivermectin into your wife to save her, and she\u2019s really started to recover, then the staff discover the ivermectin and scold her for taking anything from her husband, you know you have to turn to an AMA (against medical advice) ambulance move to another hospital. Watch this fantastic story now.\n\nTime to Stand Up Against the Machine! Rusty had heard about ivermectin from a documentary cameraman, so when COVID was in the news, he decided to research its effect on COVID and came across The Highwire and The FLCCC. Find out how he used the I-PREVENT and I-CARE protocols with great success in this MyStory.\n\nSylaisha and Emilia Taylor believe what happened to father and husband, Sylvester, was an attempt to punish their family for not taking the vaccine. Since Sylvester\u2019s passing, the Taylor family has heard countless stories like theirs from other families all over the United States concerning the protocol using Remdesivir, and the treatment of patients because of their vaccine status. Watch the Taylors' For The Record now.\n\n\u201cLarry was Physically Strong. His Body Could have Recovered had they given the Correct Treatment\u201d Carol begged them to continue to give Larry ivermectin and his vitamins, they said no. She begged them not to use Remdesivir on Larry, but when she received Larry\u2019s medical records after he died, she discovered they gave him Remdesivir right away for many days. She is putting Larry\u2019s story on the record.\n\nMarc, his wife and son, and their amazing team, are a high-density housing provider for people with addiction disorders. They posted Dr. Cole\u2019s and the FLCCC info at every location they had in the state. Common sense tells Marc that that information had something to do with the fact, that they had no COVID related deaths, and only 1 person hospitalized for 24hrs for COVID.
