Kennedy Jr Sues Media Outlets Over Misinformation Initiative", "cleaned_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr, son of the slain US presidential candidate, and other anti-vaccine activists have filed a lawsuit against several news organizations that have banded together to fight misinformation.\n\nThe nearly 100-page complaint, filed this week in a US District Court in Texas, accuses the media outlets and social media companies of colluding to censor other online publishers with alternative Covid narratives.\n\nBesides Kennedy, the plaintiffs include an organization he founded, Children\u2019s Health Defense, right-wing news organizations that have promoted anti-vaccine theories and physicians who are prominent Covid and vaccine skeptics.\n\nThe named defendants in the suit are The Washington Post, the BBC, the Associated Press, and Reuters.\n\nThe media outlets are members of the Trusted News Initiative (TNI), a partnership between news organizations and technology companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, YouTube and Linked-In.\n\nAgence France-Presse is also a member of TNI, whose stated goal is to \u201ctackle harmful disinformation.\u201d\n\nThe suit accuses the media companies of collaborating to \u201cexclude\u201d rival news publishers whose work \u201cchallenges and competes with TNI members\u2019 reporting on certain issues relating to Covid-19 and US politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cFederal antitrust law has its own name for this kind of \u2018industry partnership\u2019: it\u2019s called a \u2018group boycott,'\u201d the complaint said.\n\nIt claimed the plaintiffs have been \u201ccensored, de-monetized, demoted, throttled, shadow-banned, and/or excluded entirely from platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Linked-In.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the \u2018Trusted News Initiative\u2019 publicly purports to be a self-appointed \u2018truth police\u2019 extirpating online \u2018misinformation,\u2019 in fact it has suppressed wholly accurate and legitimate reporting in furtherance of the economic self-interest of its members,\u201d the suit alleges.\n\nAmong the plaintiffs are outlets and individuals who have been branded the \u201cDisinformation Dozen\u201d by the Center for Countering Digital Hate. The nonprofit has said the online \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d are responsible for a \u201ctidal wave of disinformation.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Robert F.
