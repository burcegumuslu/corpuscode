This collection of symptoms I have characterized as post viral like symptoms.\u2019\n\nThis opinion was supported by Dr Ross Walker, a Sydney cardiologist who has seen \u201960 to 70\u2032 people with adverse reactions to vaccines in the last year.\n\n\u2018I agree that\u2019s almost certainly the diagnosis\u2026 there\u2019s only about a 0.2 per cent adverse reaction [rate to vaccinations] but we\u2019re still talking about 136,000 people,\u2019 he told 2GB.\n\n\u2018To me, this is relatively clear what\u2019s happened is that the Covid vaccine has pulverized Faith\u2019s gut bacteria, which gave her the severe abdominal pain and the inability to eat properly.\u2019\n\nFaith became sick four days after the shot in August 2021 and has needed ongoing treatment which her parents, who own a small business in Launceston, have had to pay for.\n\nA year after receiving the jab, Faith still gets the uncontrollable muscle tics and twitches and is still developing new side effects.\n\nShe\u2019s developed such bad pain in her legs that can sometimes only walk for two hours at any time.\n\nHowever, her mother is adamant that despite Faith missing a year of school, and must repeat Year 11, \u2018nothing will hold her back\u2019.\n\n\u2018She as determined to go to her school formal, even though she was ticking and she could only go for an hour,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018She has always been a tough kid,\u2019 Ms Ranson said of Faith, who was her local junior army battalion cadet of the year at the age of 15.\n\nThe same year she received the citizenship award for Launceston Christian School.\n\nHowever, Faith\u2019s condition means she won\u2019t be able to get medical clearance to join the armed forces and serve for her country.\n\n\u2018We have been told that is impossible now,\u2019 Tania said\n\nBut undeterred the now 17-year-old stays up late studying an online criminal psychology course, even though she is interrupted by constant, painful muscle ticking.\n\nOut of nearly 64 million Covid vaccinations in Australia, there have been 136,523 reported \u2018adverse events\u2019.\n\nAccording to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, there are 2.1 adverse events reported for every 1,000 Covid vaccine doses. Federal Budget documents found payouts for Covid vaccine injuries are expected to jump to nearly $77mllion by July 2023.\n\nAfter developing \u2018extreme abdominal pain\u2019 within days of the jab, Faith began to dramatically lose weight, eventually to around 40kg from her original 55kg.\n\nDoctors removed her appendix, but the pain remained.\n\nWhen her mum Tania asked whether the vaccine be responsible she said \u2018I was looked at like I was an idiot\u2019 and told \u2018don\u2019t be silly\u2019.\n\nOne paediatrician even told her the cause of her severe pain and distress was \u2018too much screen time\u2019.\n\nIn November, Tania Ranson wrote in a Facebook update that her daughter was exhausted from the involuntary muscle spasms.\n\n\u2018Faith had a really bad 45 minute tic as they call it, but her body was thrashed around her neck was pulling back and forth and her legs were also [thrashing] around.\n\n\u2018[The tics] would last around half an hour most nights, they are painful for her as all her mussels are pulled and very sore.\u2019\n\nWithin three months Ms Ranson was told by a local immunologist he had no doubt that Faith\u2019s adverse delayed reaction to her second Pfizer vaccine had triggered her condition.\n\nIn February 2022 she was diagnosed with functional neurological disorder (FND) and had to begin rehab sessions.\n\nIt is believed the side effects occurred after the vaccine destroyed bacteria in Faith\u2019s gut.\n\nShe continued to deteriorated \u2018physically and mentally\u2019, including blackouts, and in January the family turned to public donations to help pay Faith\u2019s medical bills.\n\nThe family claimed the government said Faith\u2019s condition was ineligible for financial support.\n\nSo far the GoFundMe page has raised $39,266, with a goal of $100,000.\n\nIn August 2022, Faith updated her Instagram followers, saying it was important to remain positive.\n\n\u2018While I could dwell on absolutely all the negative experiences I\u2019ve had with doctors (there are quite a lot) I want to talk about all the good I have experienced from people I did know and those I didn\u2019t even know,\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018While I have my good and bad days and every day is different I have learned to adapt.\u2019\n\nShe explained that new symptoms were regularly appearing, including her legs aching so badly that she couldn\u2019t walk \u2013 as well as being \u2018constantly in pain\u2019.\n\nThe teenager explained that \u2018adapting\u2019 had been her best weapon against the dilapidating condition.\n\n\u2018I have learned small things to help me but I am still learning and growing to understand what has happened to me, how I can deal with this, what life in the future may look like for me and acknowledge that this is going to be a long road and this road will late potentially years,\u2019 she wrote.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian teenager reaction to Covid Pfizer vaccine | Daily Mail Online - Vaccine Safety Info", "description": "An Australian schoolgirl has developed a baffling illness after getting a Covid jab, with the teenager suffering a rare reaction that has left her in", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11350691/Australian-teenager-reaction-Covid-Pfizer-vaccine.html", "site_name": "Vaccine Safety Info", "article:tag": "via bookmarklet", "article:section": "Uncategorized", "image": "https://vaccinesafety.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5627-63857613-0-image-a-6_1666763921277.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://vaccinesafety.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5627-63857613-0-image-a-6_1666763921277.jpg", "image:width": "636", "image:height": "382", "image:alt": "Australian teenager reaction to Covid Pfizer vaccine | Daily Mail Online", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2022-10-30T07:40:35+00:00"}, "tags": ["dailymail", "pfizer", "via bookmarklet", "news"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/news/pfizer/index.html", "https://www.2gb.com/teenagers-harrowing-journey-after-covid-vaccine-side-effect/", "https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/approved-vaccines/pfizer", "https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/approved-vaccines/astrazeneca", "https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/approved-vaccines/moderna", "https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-information-on-nuvaxovid-novavax-covid-19-vaccine", "https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-side-effect-checker", "https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-faith", "https://www.instagram.com/stand_with_faith/", "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/conversion-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355197"], "authors": ["Peter Vincent"], "publish_date": "2022-10-30T07:40:35+00:00"}
