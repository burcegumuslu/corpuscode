At best, they become shells of their former selves, and he can no longer stand it.\n\nSeveral players on rival teams such as CFR Cluj and Rapid Bucuresti have also been struggling or have died because of getting injected, he says. One of them is 36-year-old winger Ciprian Deac.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to laugh, but I might be right,\u201d Becali said to Romanian journalist Emanuel Rosu. \u201cThose vaccinated lose their strength. That\u2019s something scientific.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen it at CFR? With Rapid, the players seemed to be fainting. They slept on the ground. All vaccinated people lose their strength! I also see mine, the vaccinated ones. It doesn\u2019t affect some, but it does affect those who are older. Haven\u2019t you seen Deac? There is no more storm.\u201d\n\nRomanian government condemns Becali, says footballers do not lose strength after getting jabbed\n\nAnother player, Steaua Bucharest striker Claudiu Keseru, returned to the club back in August after six years at the Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets. Since he, too, got vaccinated, he is no longer able to play at the same high level as he did before.\n\n\u201cI gave him the money, I had a contract with him, he was a football player, I was the owner,\u201d Becali said to Sport.ro about Keseru\u2019s return to the team.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You can\u2019t go to this level anymore. You can play in Romania, but not at FCSB (Steaua Bucharest) and CFR!\u2019 He said he would show me, but he has nothing to show me. It can\u2019t be at this level anymore. It\u2019s possible because of the vaccine. I say what I think. I don\u2019t want to offend him.\u201d\n\nThe Romanian government reacted to Becali\u2019s statements with condemnation, declaring without evidence on its official Facebook page that:\n\n\u201cVaccinated footballers do NOT lose their strength after being vaccinated against COVID-19!\n\nFrom a medical and scientific point of view, there are no studies that would support a singularity like the one recently promoted on Facebook accounts in Romania.\n\nVaccination against COVID-19 does not affect the performance of football players. In contrast, there are enough studies showing that going through SARS CoV-2 infection leaves long-term sequelae (Long COVID), and these can influence athletes\u2019 performance.\u201d\n\nRosu also says that Becali has a policy on his team that only people that fake getting vaccinated are allowed to play, that way their strength is confirmed. However, according to reports, Rosu\u2019s claim remains unconfirmed.\n\nIn the comment section at Newspunch, one person wrote that one of the goals of the plandemic injection scam is to \u201cmake mice of young healthy men, the type who might create revolution for a long time.\u201d\n\nThis same commenter added that they have been demasculinized with all sorts of things, including mind control. The United States especially has also faced many decades of seeing men be disempowered and women empowered, and their roles reversed at every level of family and society.\n\nThe inevitable outcome of America\u2019s perpetual feminization, which occurs in the social, economic and even religious realm, is that society is now largely a passive, compliant freak show. And all the while, the strongest among us, including athletes and those in the military, are being systematically taken out through \u201cscience\u201d and \u201cmedicine.\u201d\n\nMore Fauci Flu shot news can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Romania\u2019s largest soccer club bans vaccinated players because they keep dropping dead", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2022-03-04-romanian-soccer-club-bans-vaccinated-players-dead.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "The owner of Steaua Bucharest, a Romanian soccer club, has announced that no more covid-vaccinated players are allowed on the team since they tend to \u201close power\u201d or \u201cdie in hospital.\u201d Gigi Becali, the businessman and politician who runs the team, says that no more vaccinated players are allowed because he is tired of seeing [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.collapse.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/03/Freestyle-Football-Soccer-Active-Art-Association-Attack.jpg"}, "tags": ["vaccinated", "heart attacks", "Vaccine deaths", "ban", "banned", "COVID", "vaccine injury", "vaccines", "spike protein", "soccer club", "dead", "athletes", "Romania", "Plandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://newspunch.com/romanias-biggest-soccer-club-bans-vaccinated-players-because-they-keep-dropping-dead/", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-02-25-emails-trump-global-racketeering-collusion-covid-vaccines.html", "http://chemicalviolence.com", "https://newspunch.com/romanias-biggest-soccer-club-bans-vaccinated-players-because-they-keep-dropping-dead/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-02-25-emails-trump-global-racketeering-collusion-covid-vaccines.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fcollapse%2F2022-03-04-romanian-soccer-club-bans-vaccinated-players-dead.html&linkname=Romania%E2%80%99s%20largest%20soccer%20club%20bans%20vaccinated%20players%20because%20they%20keep%20dropping%20dead", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
