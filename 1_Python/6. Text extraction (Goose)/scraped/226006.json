Most recently the Berliner Zeitung reported on physician Erich Freisleben, whose practice is virtually \u201coverrun\u201d by patients with vaccination side effects.\n\nAccording to Achgut.com, Dr. Freisleben \u201cestimates the cases of severe vaccine side effects at three percent. That would affect a projected one million people in Germany alone.\u201d\n\nAccording to Freisleben: \u201cI\u2019ve seen maybe five or six side effects with vaccines before in 35 years of practicing medicine. For the novel vaccines, I have now counted 96. That\u2019s out of proportion.\u201d\n\nAchgut.com comments that \u201cwe are dealing here with a completely new vaccination technology\u201d and: \u201cWe do not yet know what the new mRNA vaccines will do to our immune system.\u201d\n\nFreisleben warns against compulsory vaccination and that a \u201csoftening of the Basic Law would mean not having understood the lessons of history.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompulsory vaccination would open the door wide to abuse,\u201d the Berlin physician adds.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Pandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.achgut.com/artikel/impfschaeden_das_thema_erreicht_den_mainstream", "https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Achgut.png", "https://www.achgut.com/artikel/impfschaeden_das_thema_erreicht_den_mainstream", "https://www.achgut.com/artikel/bericht_zur_coronalage_millionen_deutsche_wegen_impffolgen_beim_arzt", "https://www.achgut.com/artikel/erzeugen_die_zugelassenen_impfstoffe_einen_nettoschaden", "https://www.achgut.com/artikel/warum_werden_corona_geimpfte_so_krank", "https://www.achgut.com/artikel/impffolgen_wieviele-wird_es_treffen", "https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/gesundheit-oekologie/eine-impfpflicht-wuerde-das-tor-zum-missbrauch-weit-oeffnen-li.219816", "https://www.achgut.com/artikel/impfschaeden_das_thema_erreicht_den_mainstream", "https://www.achgut.com/artikel/impfschaeden_das_thema_erreicht_den_mainstream"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
