The film will run until Thursday, September 23, screening a total of 34 times.\n\nIf you live in or near the city, we invite you to come to see this powerful new film about four families and their ongoing struggle to find the truth about the death of their loved ones on September 11, 2001. (A New York City executive order requires that proof of vaccination be shown to gain admittance to the cinema.)\n\nThe film also includes interviews with psychologist Robert Griffin, engineer Tony Szamboti, and world-renowned forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht, who weighs in on the autopsy report of 9/11 victim Bobby McIlvaine (whose family is profiled in the September 2021 cover story of The Atlantic) and the extreme fragmentation of human bodies seen in the World Trade Center\u2019s destruction.\n\nThe film will be released online shortly after the theatrical run is over. We are currently working to secure the best possible platform for the film to be seen widely, since AE911Truth\u2019s YouTube channel continues to be shadow banned. So stay tuned!", "opengraph": {"title": "'The Unspeakable' opens today at the Village East: Get your tickets now!", "description": "Today, AE911Truth\u2019s new film The Unspeakable, directed by Dylan Avery, opens at the Village East in New York City.
