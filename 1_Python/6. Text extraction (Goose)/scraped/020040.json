Some breeds of dogs, such as the golden retriever, have a 60% chance of getting cancer in their lifetime (a slightly higher prevalence than people). Smaller dogs and cats have a lower risk, but all pets are at risk for this disease. Aside from some genetic mutations pets have gone through in the name of purebred breeds, the big culprit of pet cancer growth is hidden in environmental factors \u2013 particular what food they eat.\n\nJust as processed food we eat is a recently new movement, our pets also used to eat home cooked meals, or raw meat \u2013 whatever their owners could spare from their own kitchens. This is how things were for over 16,000 years of the first domesticated pets.\n\nCommercially sold pet food did not become available until around 1860s (but only as luxury food). A century later, the first canned food became available in the U.S. in 1922; and these canned full-meals gained popularity in the 1960s, when pets were accepted as a part of the family.\n\nUnfortunately, at the same time as the food we eat has become more and more unhealthy \u2013 full of genetically modified ingredients (GMOs), banned-in-other-countries chemicals, and contaminated with heavy metals \u2013 the same has happened to pet food.\n\nExcept the amounts of these toxins are astonishingly higher, and they are given to animals with much smaller bodies, thus an even worse risk. This is contributing to a number of pet diseases including cancer.\n\nTo help prevent your pet from getting sick, the Clean Label Project tested 1,084 pet food products (both wet and dry dog and cat food) in 2017 and found the ones that are the safest and the ones that are the riskiest.\n\nDid your dog\u2019s favorite food brand make the list?\n\nHealth Risks Associated with Toxic Ingredients in Pet Food\n\nWhen looking at the contaminants commonly found in pet food, the ones that are of most concern starting from the worst one are:\n\nMercury is a toxic heavy metal that has been linked to neurological impairment, and fish has been heavily contaminated with mercury due to environmental pollution. A few years back it became such a high-risk food that health organizations issued a warning for consumers that the safe limit for an adult is three cans of tuna a month, two cans of tuna for a child ages 6 to 12, and only half a can of tuna for a child under the age of 6.\n\nThe Clean Label Project found the same amount of mercury in many brands of pet food as in a can of tuna. By weight alone, pets, especially cats, can consume extremely high amounts of mercury from wet canned food. While a 4-year-old child who weighs about 40 pounds is recommended just a half a can of tuna per month, a cat with an average weight of about 10 pounds can consume 62 cans of this contaminated food per month if fed twice a day.\n\nThat is an almost 500 times higher risk.\n\nLead is another heavy metal and a neurotoxin, is associated neurological impairment, gastrointestinal problems, skeletal symptoms, renal issues, cardiac symptoms, and liver dysfunction.\n\nIt has been of high concern of many after it was found severely over the safe limit in Flint, Michigan water supplies that poisoned many children.\n\nWhile the allowed limit is 15 PPB (even though there is no safe limit for lead), and the water in Flint contained 158 PPB, pet food was found to be contaminated with as much as 1,420 PPB.\n\nBPA: 980% More Than in Chicken Soup\n\nBPA or Bisphenol A is a toxin often found in plastics, can lead to heart issues, cancer, and again, neurological impairment. The testing found 980% higher amounts of BPA in pet food than in a can of chicken soup.\n\nCadmium: 206% More Than in Cigarettes\n\nCadmium, yet another heavy metal is also linked to neurological impairment as well as high blood pressure, and kidney and liver damage.\n\nIn pet food, it was measured as high as 3,512 PPB, more than twice higher than in cigarette tobacco (1,700 PPB).\n\nAcrylamide, a chemical used in industrial processes of making dyes and plastics, can lead to neurological impairment and gastrointestinal problems.\n\nPesticides are linked to neurological impairment and kidney damage.\n\nMycotoxins, often used in bioterrorism, are associated with cancer risk.\n\nArsenic, also known as rat poison, leads to gastrointestinal issues. There was twice more arsenic found in 75% of pet foods than the EPA allows in drinking water.\n\n(All of these are equally dangerous for humans).\n\nOut of all of the pet food tested, the Clean Label Projects found three main repeating findings that you have to know:\n\u2022 Pet food that is labeled \u201cgrain-free\u201d has the highest amount of contaminants (with some exceptions).\n\u2022 Products that contain fish tested the worst with the most amounts of toxins.\n\u2022 Products that use turkey as their main ingredient are the safest with the least amount of chemicals.\n\u2022 Look at brand report cards to see how your favorite brand rates.\n\nBest of Dog Food: Dry, Wet, and Snacks\n\nOut of all of the products tested, the Clean Label Project provided a simple and useful top 5 list for pet owners to know which products to choose from and which to avoid. These lists go through both wet and dry foods, and snacks.\n\nreport this adYou can look at these individually at Clean Label Project.\n\nCanidae Grain Free Under the Sun Adult With Chicken\n\n Eagle Pack Large and Giant Breeds Natural\n\n Purina Puppy Chow Tender & Crunchy\n\nWhole Paws Grain Free Turkey & Sweet Potato Stew\n\n Simply Nourish Grain Free Beef Pot Roast Dinner\n\n Dick Van Patten\u2019s Natural Balance Grain Free, Limited Ingredient Diet Chicken and Sweet Potato Formula in Broth Shreds\n\n Simply Nourish Grain Free Turkey & Duck Stew\n\nTHE #1 WORST DRY DOG FOOD: Holistic Select Grain Free Adult & Puppy Health Salmon and Anchovy and Sardine Meal Recipe\n\nEarthborn Holistic Grain Free Ocean Fusion\n\n TimberWolf Grain Free Legends Lamb and Herring with Apples and Herbs\n\n Simple Nourish Limited Ingredient Diet Sweet Potato & Salmon Recipe\n\n TimberWolf Grain Free Legends Black Forest Venison and Lamb with Herbs and Berries\n\nHi Tek Rations Naturals Peanut Butter Flavor\n\n Dick Van Patten\u2019s Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Treats Small Breed Brown Rice and Lamb Meal Formula\n\n Dick Van Patten\u2019s Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Treats Sweet Potato and Chicken Formula\n\n Iams Proactive Health Small Biscuits with Natural Chicken Flavor\n\nBest of Cat Food: Dry, Wet, and Snacks\n\n#1 BEST DRY CAT FOOD: Purina Beyond Simply White Meat Chicken and Whole Oat Recipe\n\nCanidae Grain Free Under the Sun Indoor With Chicken\n\n Meow Mix Tender Centers Salmon and White Meat Chicken\n\n Purina Grain Free Beyond White Meat Chicken and Egg Recipe\n\n 9 Lives Daily Essentials Chicken, Beef, and Salmon\n\nGrain Free Turkey, Chicken & Giblets Dinner\n\n Purina Friskies Savory Shreds Turkey and Cheese Dinner in Gravy\n\n Whole Paws Grain Free Beef & Chicken Dinner\n\n Purina Friskies Indoor Homestyle Turkey Dinner with Garden Greens\n\n Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken\n\n#1 BEST CAT SNACKS: Three Dog Bakery We Pity the Kitties Premium Chicken\n\nPet Pride Growth & Maintenance Chicken Dinner in Gravy\n\n Pet Pride Growth & Maintenance Turkey & Gravy Giblets in Gravy\n\n Orijen Wild Boar Natural Wild Boar\n\n Pet Pride Growth & Maintenance Beef in Gravy\n\nTaste of the Wild Grain Free Canyon River Feline Formula Trout and Smoked Salmon\n\n Nature\u2019s Logic Feline Sardine Meal Feast\n\n Wellness Complete Health Indoor Health Salmon & Whitefish Meal Recipe\n\n Wellness Grain Free Core Original Formula\n\n Orijen Regional Red Angus Beef, Wild Boar, Goat, Lamb, Pork, Mackerel\n\nMeow Mix Irresistibles Crunch Salmon and Ocean Whitefish Flavor\n\n Purina Friskies Party Mix Original Chicken, Liver and Turkey Flavors\n\n Purina Friskies Party Mix Treasure Island Salmon, Shrimp and Tuna Flavors\n\n Purina Friskies Party Mix Beachside Shrimp, Crab & Tuna Flavors\n\nWhat\u2019s Next in the Fight for Clean Pet Food?\n\u2022 Watch the Clean Label Project\u2019s video that summarizes the study\u2019s findings:\n\u2022 Sign a petition by The Clean Label Project to demand labeling transparency from the FDA.\n\u2022 Switch to buying the safest tested dog food (wet by Stella & Chewy\u2019s , dry by TruDog, and treats by Dogswell), and cat food (wet by Whole Paws and dry by Purina).\n\u2022 Share this article with other pet owners.\n\nCould poor quality pet food be the reason for the pet cancer epidemic in the United States?
