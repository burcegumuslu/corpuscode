But Interest Is Waning.\n\nAs government officials close the book on the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities are turning their attention to the next chapter of the vaccination campaign.\n\nThough nothing is etched in stone, federal officials are considering the authorization of another booster shot this spring.\n\nThe timing of that decision \u2014 and who would be eligible \u2014 remains unclear. But for older residents or those with underlying health conditions that make them more likely to develop a severe COVID-19 illness, another booster could provide peace of mind and an additional jolt of protection.\n\nAuthorities in Britain have already green-lighted a spring booster shot \u2014 but only for nursing home residents, seniors 75 or older or those who are immunosuppressed and at least 5 years old.\n\nCancer and Heart Disease Vaccines \u2018Ready by End of the Decade\u2019\n\nMillions of lives could be saved by a groundbreaking set of new vaccines for a range of conditions including cancer, experts have said. A leading pharmaceutical firm said it is confident that jabs for cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, and other conditions will be ready by 2030.\n\nStudies into these vaccinations are also showing \u201ctremendous promise,\u201d with some researchers saying 15 years\u2019 worth of progress has been \u201cunspooled\u201d in 12 to 18 months thanks to the success of the COVID-19 jab.\n\nDr. Paul Burton, the chief medical officer of pharmaceutical company Moderna, said he believes the firm will be able to offer such treatments for \u201call sorts of disease areas\u201d in as little as five years.\n\nLos Angeles County has ended its COVID-19 employee vaccination requirement, allowing workers \u2014 including sheriff\u2019s deputies and firefighters \u2014 to be hired even if they haven\u2019t gotten a shot.\n\nThe policy change, which took effect Monday, is the latest COVID-19-related rule to be relaxed in L.A. County as officials continue to steadily unwind the emergency phase of their pandemic response.\n\n\u201cThere is no longer a COVID-19 vaccination requirement for new hires or existing county employees unless otherwise mandated by federal, state, or local regulations or orders,\u201d said Jesus Ruiz, a spokesperson with L.A. County\u2019s chief executive office.\n\nPfizer to Buy COVID-Flu Test Developer Lucira Health out of Bankruptcy Court\n\nPfizer Inc., the world\u2019s largest drug maker, will buy the assets of at-home COVID-flu test developer Lucira Health Inc. following an auction Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.\n\nAfter meeting with an official bankruptcy court committee of unsecured creditors, Emeryville-based Lucira declared Pfizer, the manufacturer of a critical COVID-19 vaccine and drug, as the successful bidder.\n\nThe next highest bidder was Pearsanta Inc., a recently formed subsidiary of Richmond, Virginia-based Aditxt Inc., according to a bankruptcy court filing.\n\nCourt filings did not disclose how much the companies bid for Lucira, which was the first company to win Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization in late 2020 for an at-home, do-it-yourself molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19.\n\nNew Clinical Trial to Test Paxlovid\u2019s Effectiveness Against Long COVID\n\nMillions of people worldwide are suffering from often debilitating symptoms of long COVID that can persist for weeks, months, or even years following an acute infection. But researchers are still in the dark on the mechanisms underlying and how to treat the mysterious post-viral syndrome.\n\nA new clinical trial using the oral antiviral Paxlovid will provide urgently needed insights for COVID-19 long-haulers and their providers.\n\nSince the pandemic\u2019s onset, Harlan Krumholz, M.D., Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) and professor in the Institute for Social and Policy Studies, of investigative medicine, and of public health and Akiko Iwasaki, Ph.D., Sterling Professor of Immunobiology and professor of dermatology, of molecular, cellular & developmental biology, and of epidemiology have been leaders in unraveling the mysteries of long COVID and advocating for those who are suffering.\n\nThrough their clinical trial, they plan to combine their expertise in the clinic and lab to understand the biological mechanisms that occur throughout the course of receiving Paxlovid. The trial will be held through a unique decentralized format designed to boost accessibility for its participants.\n\nPfizer Seeks FDA Approval of First Vaccine to Protect Infants by Injecting Pregnant Mothers. Late-Stage Trial Failed to Meet One of Two Goals.\n\nPharmaceutical giant Pfizer is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a first-of-its-kind vaccine aimed at protecting infants from the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but trial data shows the shot failed to meet one of its two main goals.\n\nThe Bivalent Prefusion F Vaccine developed by Pfizer is administered to expectant mothers during the second half of their pregnancy to protect infants against RSV.\n\nAccording to the late-stage trial data, the experimental vaccine was 82% effective in preventing severe cases of the potentially deadly virus in infants 90 days after birth, but that dropped to 69% efficacy in preventing severe infections up to 180 days after a baby is born.\n\nThe Pfizer shot also failed to meet its second goal of reducing non-severe illness in newborns, Reuters reported.\n\nPfizer RSV Vaccine for Older Adults Should Be Monitored for Nervous System Condition Guillain-Barr\u00e9, Scientists Say\n\nPeople who receive Pfizer\u2019s RSV vaccine for older adults should be monitored for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome after two people developed the nervous system disorder after they received the shot, scientists said in clinical trial results published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe scientists concluded the vaccine was effective in preventing lower respiratory tract illness in adults ages 60 and older without any evident safety concerns. But they flagged the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases as a potential cause for concern moving forward.\n\n\u201cIf RSVpreF vaccine is approved and recommended, these adverse events warrant close monitoring in future studies and with real-world data and postmarketing surveillance,\u201d the scientists wrote. The study, which published Wednesday, was supported by Pfizer.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a rare disorder in which the body\u2019s immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves. Symptoms can range from brief weakness to paralysis, according to the National Institutes of Health. Most people recover, even from severe cases.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Another COVID Booster Shot May Be Coming.
