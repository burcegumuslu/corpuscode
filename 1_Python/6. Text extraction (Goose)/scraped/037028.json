The fatality rate is acceptable. There can be waves of the disease. But importantly, people must have adequate immunity. People must be vaccinated, and treatment systems efficient.\n\n\u201cAfter these criteria have been met for a while, this disease can be declared endemic in Thailand,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the situation is promising and the criteria fulfilled, the ministry will make an announcement.\u201d\n\nThe permanent secretary for health said officials would take action to speed up the process towards the announcement, rather than waiting for the disease to naturally become endemic by itself, or for the WHO to declare it an endemic disease. Otherwise, it would take too long, he said.\n\nAfter Covid-19 was declared endemic, the government would treat patients according to their individual needs and may require everyone or only patients to wear face masks, Dr Kiattiphum said.\n\nAt present, the National Communicable Disease Committee requires everyone to wear a face mask while in a public place. Violators can be fined up to 20,000 baht.\n\nDetailed criteria and appropriate future measures had yet to be finalised, he said.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
