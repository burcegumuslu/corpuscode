And with the threat of a virus still looming over your head, it\u2019s time to up the immunity game. These frozen treats can help give you a fighting chance against viruses or pathogens heading your way. Here are three delicious popsicle recipes that\u2019ll help beat the summer heat, and boost your immunity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with immunity \u2014 and can you actually boost it?\n\nYour immune system is your body\u2019s defense system, and it does a pretty good job of defending you against disease-causing microorganisms. But sometimes, due to poor diet and lifestyle habits, it fails, leaving you vulnerable to pathogens (like coronavirus) that can invade your body. So, what if you improve your diet and make some healthy lifestyle changes? To function well, the immune system needs balance and precise synchronization. The immune system is not a single thing. It\u2019s actually made up of a network of tissues, cells, molecules, and organs working together to protect your body. Each of these elements plays a key role in how the immune system functions as a whole. How it functions, is vital to prevent infection and disease.\n\nAt the moment, though, there is still so much that researchers need to learn about the intricacies of the immune system. Let\u2019s face it; if they knew more, we\u2019d probably have a vaccine to cure most ailments. But that doesn\u2019t mean the effects of a healthy diet and lifestyle on the immune system shouldn\u2019t be explored. Today, more than ever, researchers are looking at how diet, exercise, psychological stress, and other factors affect the immune response. In the meantime, until they find a cure for the common cold, it\u2019s important to do everything you can to keep your immune system robust and healthy. Good nutrition points you in the right direction. These healthy popsicles can help boost your immunity, and they\u2019re fast and easy to make. All you need are some nutritionally dense foods, popsicle molds, a blender, and a freezer.\n\nThis golden milk coconut popsicle is a refreshing twist on the golden milk latte. The inflammation-fighting ingredients include coconut milk, honey, ginger, and turmeric. Turmeric provides immune-boosting benefits. Studies show that curcumin \u2014 the main compound in turmeric \u2014 helps manage inflammatory conditions like metabolic syndrome, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, inflammation-induced exercise, and muscle soreness. The addition of black pepper boosts curcumin\u2019s absorption rate by 2000 percent, due to piperine, the main compound in pepper. Ginger is rich in antioxidants, and its anti-inflammatory properties support the immune system via digestion and pain management. Raw Honey, also rich in antioxidants, boosts immunity because of its anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\u2022 None Blend all ingredients together in a blender.\n\nElderberries have been used for millennia to support the immune system. Often used to fight the common cold, studies reveal that elderberry has potent antiviral effects that may help combat the flu virus. According to the study, elderberry prevents the early stages of infection by blocking key viral proteins that are responsible for both entering and attaching to host cells. These elderberry popsicles boost immunity by soothing sore throats, suppressing coughs, viruses, and inflammation.\n\u2022 None Add all ingredients into a large pitcher. Stir well to incorporate.\n\u2022 None When removing popsicles from the freezer, allow to thaw for a minute or two, or run the mold under warm water for a few seconds to help release popsicles.\n\nIf you love mango and coconut, you\u2019ll love these popsicles! Mango, also known as the king of fruits in some countries, boasts an awesome nutritional profile. In fact, research shows that mango\u2019s health benefits not only improve immunity but also aid digestive health, eyesight, and lower the risk of certain cancers. Coconut, while higher in fat, is not like other saturated fats. The fat in coconut is a medium-chain fatty acid. This means that it doesn\u2019t contribute to high cholesterol as other saturated, long-chain fatty acids do. A recent study found that coconut meat contains antioxidants that help boost immunity by helping reduce inflammation in the body.\n\u2022 None Add mangoes, coconut milk, maple syrup, and coconut chunks to the blender, and blend until smooth.\n\u2022 None Scrape down the sides of the blender until blended well.\n\u2022 None Pour into popsicle molds, making sure to leave about a 1/4 inch of space at the top of the mold to allow for freezing expansion. Insert popsicle sticks into the mold.\n\u2022 None Freeze for at least 8 hours or overnight.\n\u2022 None When removing popsicles from the freezer, let thaw for a minute or two, or run the mold under warm water for a few seconds to help release popsicles.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "3 Summer Popsicle Recipes That Can Boost Your Immunity", "description": "Here are three delicious popsicle recipes that\u2019ll help beat the summer heat, and boost your immunity...naturally.
