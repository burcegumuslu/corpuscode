Mike DeWine on June 13, also allows principals and school staff to carry firearms on campus and in classrooms.\n\n\u201cOur goal continues to be to help our schools \u2013 public schools, parochial schools [and] private schools \u2013 to have the tools they need to help protect our children,\u201d said the Republican governor. \u201cWe have an obligation to do everything we can every single day to try and protect our kids.\u201d\n\nPrior to the bill\u2019s passing, only security officers or persons specifically authorized by a board of education were allowed to carry weapons. Persons authorized by education boards must have either 20 years\u2019 experience in law enforcement or 700 hours of peace officer training, as ruled by the Ohio Supreme Court in 2021.\n\nHowever, the requirement can be expensive and time-consuming for any educator wanting to carry a firearm to protect children. Renewed calls to arm educators came following the May 2022 Uvalde, Texas school shooting that saw 21 dead.\n\nHB 99 loosened this requirement by mandating up to 24 hours of initial training and eight more hours of supplemental training annually. Employees allowed to carry firearms must also submit to a yearly criminal record check. Moreover, the specific school or the district that oversees it must provide notice that it has authorized one or more persons to carry guns on campus.\n\nHB 99 helpful for areas not easily accessible to first responders\n\nGOP State Rep. Thomas Hall, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said HB 99 is helpful for rural areas where schools are not easily accessible to first responders. \u201c[While] some of the inner city schools have police officers at their school, some of these rural schools don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d\n\nGOP State Rep. Phil Plummer, a former county sheriff, agreed with the bill. He explained that HB 99 shortens the \u201clengthy\u201d process it takes to get first responders to schools in an active shooter situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable my school district would set adequate training and they wouldn\u2019t authorize anybody that wasn\u2019t capable of doing it safely,\u201d said Ohio State House Speaker Bob Cupp, also from the GOP. (Related: Reason versus delusion: Why we need armed defenders in schools to protect the lives of our children.)\n\nDespite the GOP\u2019s support of HB 99, many educators voiced disagreement over the bill. In fact, the leaders of three teachers\u2019 unions vehemently opposed the measure that permitted teachers to arm themselves.\n\nOne union, the National Education Association (NEA), had been critical of allowing school employees to carry guns on campus even before HB 99 became law.\n\n\u201cWe need fewer guns in schools, not more,\u201d said NEA President Becky Pringle. \u201cTeachers should be teaching, not acting as armed security guards.\u201d\n\n\u201cBringing more guns into schools makes schools more dangerous and does nothing to shield our students and educators from gun violence.\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers (AFT) President Randi Weingarten agreed with Pringle, saying: \u201cThe answer to gun violence is not \u2018more guns.'\u201d AFT is the second-largest teachers\u2019 union, after the NEA.\n\nJoe Eaton of the Buckeye Firearms Foundation, however, begs to differ.\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s a benefit for schools. It returns them the option of having enhanced safety and security options in their schools,\u201d said Eaton, who leads the foundation\u2019s FASTER Saves Lives program.\n\nSecondAmendment.news has more stories like this.\n\nWatch this episode of \u201cThe Dr. Duke Show\u201d that touches on Ohio Gov.
