Moreover, those who were found to be positive only had light symptoms, with just four of them being hospitalized, all of them in light condition.\n\nOver the same period of time, some 12,944 new cases of COVID-19 emerged in the control group of some 778,000 people having a diverse health profile.\n\nA comparison between the data from the two groups shows that the vaccine is 91% effective seven days or more after the second injection is administered.\n\nFrom a segmentation of the infections that did occur, it appears that the immunity increases as the days go by. Among the 254 people who contracted the virus, 76 of them were infected after seven days, 44 on the eight day, and 24 on the ninth day. Between day 22 and 24 \u2013 when the test period ended \u2013 no one was infected.\n\nAccording to the studies conducted by Pfizer, the vaccine had an efficacy of about 95%, which is considered very high.\n\nWith some 2.5 million members, Maccabi is the second largest health fund in Israel. About 900,000 of its customers have already received the first shot, and about 500,000 the second one.\n\n\u201cThe data continue to be very encouraging and to show that the effectiveness of the vaccine is high and stable,\u201d Dr. Anat Aka Zohar, head of Maccabi\u2019s Information and Digital Health Division said. \u201cThe findings clearly indicate that as the days go by after the second dose, the immunity becomes stronger.\u201d\n\nShe also emphasized that the vaccine does not only protect against infection but also again developing more severe symptoms.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci warned the public these COVID vaccines would not stop anyone from contracting the COVID \u201cvirus\u201d \u2014 rather, the vaccines would merely help in lessening the symptoms of those who get infected \u2014 exactly what all vaccines are theoretically supposed to do.\n\nYet, if we are to believe the Israeli \u201cexperts\u201d, the Pfizer vaccine is miraculously stopping people from actually becoming \u201cinfected\u201d or testing postive at all \u2014 which is in complete defiance of vaccine science.\n\nBut when it comes to this pandemic, there seems to be a lot of \u201cmiracles\u201d happening in Israel \u2014 like the complete disappearance of the seasonal flu.\n\nBig Pharma even went out of its way to convince Jews that the COVID vaccines were strictly \u201ckosher\u201d \u2014 perhaps a dog whistle that the fix was in?\n\nThere is absolutely nothing about the Pfizer vaccine that would stop people from testing positive for COVID \u2014 99.9% of people who test positive for COVID are asymptomatic.\n\nAnd a recent study in China \u2014 with 10 million people \u2014 proved that there is zero transmission of COVID in asymptomatic people.\n\nSo the only way for vaccinated Israelis to no longer test positive for COVID is for the Health Ministry to have lowered cycling threshold for the PCR test \u2014 from 35 or 40 to under 25 \u2014 which is exactly what the World Health Organization recommended two weeks ago.\n\nNot only that, the second round of the Pfizer COVID vaccine allegedly has a stronger dose than the first round \u2014 and according to the Israelis, there have been NO serious side effects or deaths reported \u2014 even though over 300 deaths have already been reported from the first Pfizer vaccine in America.\n\nAll of these \u201cmiraculous\u201d results coming out of Israel can be explained very simply \u2014 Israelis are receiving placebo vaccines, and they have changed the PCR standards to make it falsely appear that the vaccines are working \u2014 just as we predicted they would do over 6 months ago.\n\nCertainly we cannot blame the Israelis for giving their own citizens safe placebo vaccines \u2014 that\u2019s what any responsible government would do to protect its people \u2014 especially elderly and frail Holocaust survivors.\n\nAs we previously reported, it would be absolutely unconscionable and irresponsible to subject Holocaust survivors of all people to dangerous medical experimentation with these untested vaccines \u2014 international laws against such experimentation were implemented after WWII for that very reason.\n\nUnfortunately, these fake successful results in Israel will be used to convince 100s of millions of \u201cgentiles\u201d in the West that these dangerous \u2014 even deadly \u2014 vaccines are safe and effective \u2014 and many people will become disabled and die after they take \u201chot\u201d doses of the real vaccines.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["World News", "Latest"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.eutimes.net/2021/02/evidence-surfaces-israel-using-placebo-covid-vaccines-and-have-changed-pcr-test-to-prove-vaccines-are-working/", "https://www.jpost.com/health-science/covid-just-006-percent-israelis-sick-after-two-shots-no-one-serious-study-657871", "https://www.eutimes.net/2021/02/evidence-surfaces-israel-using-placebo-covid-vaccines-and-have-changed-pcr-test-to-prove-vaccines-are-working/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
