Basch, EdD, MPH, professor and chair of the Department of Public Health at William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey, who studies the spread of health misinformation.\n\nFirst of all, scientists weren't exactly starting from scratch. In 2003, while studying another coronavirus, the one that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), they identified the \"spike protein\" as a possible vaccine target, says Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \"So it's a 17-year timeline,\" he told doctors during a December 2020 vaccine forum hosted by the \u200bAnnals of Internal Medicine\u200b and American College of Physicians.\n\nIt's true that the vaccines were given a green light without having a full year of safety and efficacy data in hand. But only vaccine candidates deemed safe progress to human trials, per the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. And, according to Dr. Hotez, those trials were \"massive\" and \"well powered.\" More than 44,000 people participated in Pfizer's study, and Moderna enrolled 30,000 people.\n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) is like \"a little computer code that's telling our cells: 'Make protein,'\" as Dr. Lyke puts it. It will never affect your genetic coding; it merely trains your body to recognize the spike protein so your immune system will be prepared to mount a defense when you encounter the virus, she says.\n\nPeople with suppressed immune systems, such as folks receiving cancer treatment or those who have an autoimmune condition, should definitely get vaccinated, per Henry Ford Health System, because they will receive at least some level of protection from COVID-19, though not as much as people with healthy immune systems. Of course, always consult your physician first.\n\nRumor has it that the COVID-19 vaccine will lead to infertility in women. Per the Mayo Clinic, the disinformation campaign asserts that antibodies produced against the virus's spike protein can also bind to a protein vital for forming a human placenta and prevent pregnancy. In truth, no COVID vaccine has been linked to infertility or miscarriage, the clinic says.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says experts need to understand more about the protection the vaccine offers before deciding if and when to stop recommending mask-wearing and social distancing. So, for now, the tried-and-true advice stands: mask up, wash your hands and avoid close contact with others.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Don't buy into these COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories touted on social media.
