Most of these are mild and short term, and not everyone gets them. Even if you do have symptoms from the first dose, you still need to have the second dose. Although you should get good protection from the first dose, having the second dose should give you longer lasting protection against the virus. \n\n \n\n Very common side effects include: \n\n ..having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in arm......tends to be worse 1-2 days after vaccination. \n\n ..feeling tired. \n\n ........ headache \n\n \n\n ..general aches, or mild flu like symptoms. \n\n \n\n \n\n That's the only side effects mentioned on the info sheet that was posted to my home. \n\n I wonder if you had another info sheet to read (and possibly sign) when you turned up at the vaccine center?\n\n edit on 12-4-2023 by Itisnowagain because: (no reason given)\n\n a reply to: ScepticScot I just found the letter that I received....That's the only side effects mentioned on the info sheet that was posted to my home.I wonder if you had another info sheet to read (and possibly sign) when you turned up at the vaccine center? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginally posted by: ScepticScot \n\n \n\noriginally posted by: Asmodeus3 \n\n \n\noriginally posted by: ScepticScot \n\n \n\noriginally posted by: Asmodeus3 \n\n \n\noriginally posted by: ScepticScot \n\n \n\noriginally posted by: Asmodeus3 \n\n \n\noriginally posted by: SkyAngel \n\n AstraZeneca was banned here in Denmark pretty fast. \n\n \n\n However, it doesn't mean that my country is perfect or anything because they still allowed other useless vaccines! \n\n \n\n I think it is time for humanity to spend less time online, and instead, fight for the truth in real life! \n\n \n\n Just saying... \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes!
