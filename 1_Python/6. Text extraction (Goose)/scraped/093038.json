Conrad, Jr., said, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 and their experts should have the same opportunity as Merck to review and analyze the entirety of the data.\u201d\r\n\r\nMerck until now has refused to make the entire MARRS databases available to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.\r\n\r\nGardasil is a widely used vaccine commonly administered to teens and young adults before they are sexually active to protect against HPV infections, which can be sexually transmitted later in life.\r\n\r\nHPV infections may lead to the development of cervical cancer. However, most infections are benign and resolve on their own.\r\n\r\nThe firm Baum Hedlund Aristei & Goldman and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Children\u2019s Health Defensechairman-on-leave, have filed more than two dozen lawsuits on behalf of young people injured by Gardasil, alleging Merck knowingly and fraudulently concealed the vaccine\u2019s risks.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuits are some of the more than 80 pending in the federal court system, and that number is expected to grow. In August 2022, a judicial panel consolidated the lawsuits into a single federal courtroom.\r\n\r\nSome of the signature impacts observed following HPV vaccination \u2014 which afflict a number of the plaintiffs \u2014 include permanently disabling autoimmune and neurological conditions such aspostural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, The Defender Reported.\r\n\r\nRead More:\u00a0Court Orders Merck to Turn Over Gardasil Adverse Event Databases\r\n\r\n[trap-banner]\u00a0", "title": "Court Orders Merck to Turn Over Gardasil Adverse Event Databases"}, "tags": ["Older Posts"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://ickonic.com/", "https://ickonic.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
