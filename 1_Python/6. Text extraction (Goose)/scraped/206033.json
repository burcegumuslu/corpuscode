Now, however, the consequences of failed political leadership are turning into sky-high gas prices and now the potential for forced rationing.\n\nA recent poll found that more than 60 percent of German citizens fear there will not be enough gas to go around this winter, especially since some people will be stocking up and hoarding what they can before prices triple come 2023.\n\nGermans are starting \u201cto sweat\u201d as they realize there will be no gas available for heat this winter\n\nDraft EU measures propose limiting the heating of public and commercial buildings to 19 degrees Celsius, or around 66 degrees Fahrenheit, which is cold enough to require the use of extra layers of clothing indoors.\n\nPrivate households are also being encouraged to lower their thermostats by one degree, a proposal that was also made back in February right after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\u201cActing now can reduce the effects of a sudden supply disruption by a third,\u201d the draft proposal states, adding that \u201ceveryone can now save gas.\u201d\n\nThe more people comply with the proposal voluntarily, the document goes on to state, \u201cthe less the need for mandatory restrictions for the industry.\u201d\n\nDespite efforts to prioritize the use of gas for hospitals and households, reports explain that individual member states will still have the option to siphon gas away towards other uses if they so choose.\n\nIt will be a feeding frenzy, in other words, of European countries fighting and vying for every drop of gas they can get their hands on before it all runs out.\n\nWhat has been initially just a possibility of gas shortages this winter is quickly becoming a sure reality the longer the standoff between NATO and Russia goes. And it is clear that Germany and its allies are on the side that will suffer, not Russia.\n\nA poll by Der Spiegel found that 63 percent of the German population now fears a shortage of gas for heat this winter. Among women, that percentage is even higher at around 67 percent.\n\nWhat is more, there is widespread concern that even if enough gas is available to service everyone, it will be too expensive for many to even use it.\n\n\u201cBy 2023, gas customers will have to expect the installments to triple, at least,\u201d said Germany\u2019s Federal Network Agency head Klaus M\u00fcller.\n\nAs reality sets in, some in the German government are finally conceding that they may have to work with Russia rather than continue to hold an offensive stance against the country \u2013 especially since that stance is all hot air as Germany and NATO have no actual bargaining chips in this game of political poker.\n\n\u201cThe unspoken realization is that the renewable energy fantasy is exposed for its frailty and uselessness in replacing a fossil fuel-based economy,\u201d noted a commenter at Breitbart News.\n\nThe latest news about the gas situation in Europe can be found at FuelRationing.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "As fuel prices poised to TRIPLE, EU mulls rationing gas across bloc", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-07-18-fuel-prices-triple-eu-mulls-rationing-gas.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "The European Union (EU) is going down in flames as its fuel taps from Russia run dry.
