These algae are cousins that have similar-but different-health benefits, and they are well worth adding to your daily routine.\n\nIf you are not overly fond of leafy greens or don\u2019t get enough of them in your diet, then spirulina and/or chlorella may be the answer. When you blend them into a smoothie, you will barely even notice them, but you will benefit from all of their green goodness.\n\nChlorella is a blue-green one-celled microalgae that is native to Japan and Taiwan and is a super source of amino acids, omega-3 fatty acids, chlorophyll, potassium, phosphorus, biotin, magnesium, the B vitamins, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. Three tablespoons (about 1 oz) of powdered chlorella provide 16 grams of protein, 287 percent RDA of vitamin A, 202 percent of iron, 133 percent of zinc, 71 percent of vitamin B2, 33 percent of vitamin B3, and 22 percent of magnesium.\n\nLike chlorella, spirulina is single-celled, blue-green microalgae that are high in protein (more than in chlorella), boasts a detoxifying factor, and harbors impressive levels of nutrients, including omega-3s, iron, magnesium, copper, and several B vitamins. It has been named the \u201csingle most nutritious food on the planet.\u201d\n\nThree tablespoons (21 grams) of dried spirulina contains: 12 grams protein, 33 percent RDA of vitamin B1 (thiamin), 45 percent vitamin B2 (riboflavin), 12 percent niacin, 62 percent copper, and 33 percent iron, as well as good amounts of magnesium, manganese, potassium, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nRead about the benefits of spirulina\n\nUse of chlorella and spirulina have been credited with a lot of health benefits. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nChlorella has the ability to attach to toxins in the body, including cadmium, lead, mercury, and uranium, and prevent their absorption. These and other heavy metals can enter the body through food (e.g., fish), mercury dental fillings, air pollutants, affected water, and vaccinations. The chlorophyll in chlorella also can protect against damage from ultraviolet radiation treatments. Regular intake of chlorella can help prevent heavy metals from accumulating in the body and eliminate radioactive particles.\n\nBoth spirulina and chlorella support and promote healthy digestion and a flourishing beneficial bacteria environment in the gut. A healthy gut, in turn, supports an optimally functioning immune system.\n\nRead more more ways to keep your gut healthy\n\nImmune system cells called natural killer cells get a boost from chlorella, according to Korean researchers. Other research has shown that individuals with brain tumors who took chlorella had fewer respiratory infections and flu-like illnesses than those not taking the supplement.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t like this benefit? Spirulina contains a winning combination of carotenoids and the enzyme SOD (superoxide dismutase, a potent antioxidant), which has been shown to be good for skin health by improving age spots, acne, rashes, and eczema.\n\nA Clinical Laboratory article noted that chlorella significantly reduces a major factor (oxidative stress) associated with aging, caused by poor diet, pollution, and stress. The microalgae also naturally boost the levels of glutathione, vitamin A, and vitamin C in the body, which in turn gets rid of cell-damaging free radicals.\n\nChlorella facilitates weight loss in several ways, including regulation of hormones, improving circulation, stimulating greater energy levels, reducing body fat, eliminating toxins, and promoting metabolism. In a Japanese study, the authors found that chlorella supplementation resulted in \u201cnoticeable reductions in body fat percentage\u201d among both healthy adults as well as those at high risk for lifestyle diseases.\n\nUse of chlorella supplementation may help fight cancer by enhancing immune system function, removing toxic heavy metals from the body, and boosting the activity of T cells (immune cells that fight abnormal cells).\n\nSpirulina and chlorella are better sources of complete protein than are red meat and most other plant proteins. In fact, beef is 22 percent complete protein and lentils are 26 percent, while spirulina is about 65 to 71 percent and chlorella is 58 percent protein.\n\nSpirulina has a special cell structure composed of mucopolysaccharides, which are easily digested. This feature is a reason why the algae can lower triglycerides and cholesterol and thus support cardiovascular health. The authors of one recent study reported that overweight adults with high blood pressure who consumed spirulina daily for three months showed improvement in blood pressure and endothelial function, as well as in weight and body mass index, all of which have an impact on cardiovascular health.\n\nHow to buy and take spirulina and chlorella\n\nBoth supplements are available as a powder, tablet, and capsule. The recommended form is powder, since it is easily added to smoothies and liquids. Because the cell walls of chlorella are a challenge to digest, you should look for supplements that read \"cracked cell wall chlorella\", which means your body will more easily absorb the supplement.\n\nSuggested preventive and therapeutic dosages of spirulina for adults are, respectively, 6 to 10 grams daily and 11 to 20 grams daily. For chlorella, they are 3 to 4 grams daily and 5 to 7 grams daily, respectively.\n\nJung SM et al. Assessment of spirulina-PCL nanofiber for the regeneration of dermal fibroblast layers.
