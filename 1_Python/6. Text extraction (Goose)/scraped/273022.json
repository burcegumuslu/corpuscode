The level of level one. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m above them. There\u2019s nothing wrong with just living your life and getting on with it. But in terms of like everyday conversation where people are saying things like, how are you, you know, how was your weekend? Those dead statements, that needs to be like level zero, where there\u2019s just no content.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:01:28] Welcome to Skeptiko where we explore controversial science and spirituality with leading researchers, thinkers and their critics. I\u2019m your host, Alex Tsakiris and today we welcome James Ellis. Was it okay to out you James, because you were flying under the radar for a while?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:01:49] Yeah, and I\u2019ve been under the name Meta-Nomad for like\u2026 since 2017 I\u2019ve been blogging and writing under that name. I just about remember the old days old days of the internet, where forums were full of anonymous people with cool sounding names, and I really miss that anonymity. So that was one reason and also just so you don\u2019t get the two things crossed. And then I started doing things, like courses where I thought just for like legitimization I need to do the whole real-life thing, a real-life name. So yeah, James Ellis is fine is that the short answer to that?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:02:30] Well, great. I mean, you know, like we were just chatting about just a second ago. There are so many jumping off points for folks like you and I really am open to thinking, kind of in these parallel and non-parallel kind of ways, you know, what is reality, What is anonymity anymore and what is identity and all that kind of stuff. But we should just jump right into this and let people know that we\u2019re kind of doing a swapcast here, but I\u2019m primarily interviewing you for Skeptiko and then this may go out on your excellent feed, the Hermitix podcast. Let me pull it up here for people because we were just chatting about it a minute ago if anyone\u2019s watching on YouTube. But really some great stuff here a lot of very, very insightful, deep, philosophical level three, as I like to call them, kind of conversations.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:03:31] Okay. Well level three. First what\u2019s level one? What\u2019s level one is like science. So science is level one. Is there science? Like that\u2019s one of the survey questions we\u2019re going to go over. And what is the meaning of science? Is science obsoleted by consciousness, an understanding of consciousness that consciousness is fundamental and that maybe idealism is a better way of thinking about what we experience than is scientific materialism? So that\u2019s kind of level one.\n\nAnd then level two is conspiracy, really, which is if you get there and you say, wow, it\u2019s really an absurd idea to think that consciousness is an illusion, that it doesn\u2019t exist. I mean, it\u2019s an absurd philosophical idea, it\u2019s also an absurd scientific idea because it\u2019s been falsified. The idea that you\u2019re an epiphenomenon of the brain really doesn\u2019t hold up. So level two is kind of the controversy of conspiracy that comes in when we think\u2026\n\nAnd then level three is shit, man. So now that we\u2019re there, you know, once I get past those two, let\u2019s chat. But if you can\u2019t come to grips with those two, then to me you can\u2019t begin to have the level three conversation. How does that hit you?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:04:56] Yeah, that works. I mean, I would say though that you need to introduce a level zero. Not the zero I talk of a lot, but level zero for what the people online call normies because I don\u2019t think most people are operating on the level of level one. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m above them, there\u2019s nothing wrong with just living your life and getting on with it. But in terms of like everyday conversation, where people are saying things like, how are you, you know, how was your weekend? Those dead statements, that needs to be like level zero. Where there\u2019s just no content. And I try to actually veer away from them because I actually find it just an actual waste of time.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:33] Well, first of all, my orientation on this stuff, which I don\u2019t know why, but the nature of the show is, you know, Skeptiko, inquiry to perpetuate doubt. And it must be annoying to other people sometimes, but I\u2019m always thinking to the counter of that, you know, which on one hand, I totally, totally agree with that. And I think you make a great point and I think the way you characterize it is level zero, obviously, yeah, that normies, and that is such a pejorative term, but we get it. We all get it immediately.\n\nBut at the same time, there\u2019s something fundamental about where we get at the end in level three, that is almost circular and brings us back to level zero. Because it\u2019s like, really, what the fuck are we going to talk about? We might as well talk about football, and we might as well talk about the weather, because to suppose that we can have some deep, deep, you know, and really solve these answers to these questions in any other way than just kind of intellectually, just kind of stimulating ourselves. I don\u2019t know. Maybe it is back to, there\u2019s a certain basic human connection at level zero as well, that I think we got to acknowledge that it\u2019s just like, hey, I\u2019m a human being, you\u2019re a human being. What the fuck, let\u2019s talk about the weather and whether it\u2019s going to rain today, you know what I mean? What do you think about that?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:07:04] Yeah, I agree. But if someone started talking to me about the weather, I probably would try to shy away from it. I think that\u2019s a question of method though. So like anything can be super, super interesting to talk about, but it\u2019s a question of how you approach the subject. Just saying, \u201cOh, bad weather we\u2019re having today.\u201d \u201cYeah it is.\u201d Those are the kinds of conversations I actually really struggle to do because I don\u2019t really see the point in them at all. But if someone was saying like, you know, if we actually began a discussion, someone came up to me and said, \u201cDo you believe the astrological movements make it rain or whatever?\u201d I\u2019ve never really looked into that, but if they said that, I\u2019d be like onboard straight away.\n\nSo I get what you\u2019re saying, that you can actually come back round and it\u2019s in terms of everyday reality, there\u2019s a certain intuition there, which makes things super interesting.\n\nAnd I know I\u2019m already bringing him in, you said we were going to mention him, but John Michael Greer, his whole sort of approachable conception of cultism when he sort of says, once you sort of begin to understand the way these things are working, the way you intuit the world, things begin to appear to you, which you are taught to say are rubbish. So it\u2019s like those weird feelings you get at a time, or the idea that in a certain room you shouldn\u2019t go in there or a certain forest, there\u2019s something strange. You\u2019re in a place and you think, something happened here way back in time that was really awful. Something along those lines. And that intuition you just get taught to suppress it because it\u2019s not, we already jumping into the science thing, it\u2019s not scientific, it\u2019s not logical.\n\nBut that level three to level zero connection is you can utilize level three to begin to sort of, what I\u2019d say is enchant the world.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:08:48] There\u2019s a lot to probably break down a little bit there. And I love jumping into the middle of this stuff because if we lose people great, you shouldn\u2019t have been here anyway. But if you stuck around this long, then maybe it is worthwhile to go back and kind of just tell people where you\u2019re coming from in general. And I think this idea that you talk about so much, accelerationism and zero accelerationism, I think, capitalism. I think you\u2019re going to have an idea that certainly is\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve got to say when I first heard you talking about capitalism, I was like, what the fuck is he talking about? Versus compared to what, there is nothing else, other than free people doing what they want to kind of survive. Anything else to me seems absurd. But we could talk for an hour on that, so go ahead.\n\nJames Ellis: [00:09:53] Okay. So yeah, so I should have sort of done a full intro. So, for those who don\u2019t know me I host Hermitix podcast, which is a podcast of philosophy and fringe subjects, so cultism, parapsychology, weird stuff. I think anyone who\u2019s into that stuff sort of know the kinds of topics that would be on there.\n\nI target it primarily from a continental philosophy angle because that\u2019s what my education background is in. My master\u2019s is in continental philosophy and when I was studying continental philosophy my tutors were great, they were great people, they taught everything that was on our curriculum and they taught well. So this isn\u2019t really anything against them at all, I still speak to them and I\u2019ve had one of them on the show. But in terms of the way academia confront philosophy in those terms, it\u2019s very disheartening because there\u2019s a lot going on behind the scenes which is sort of ignored because it\u2019s almost like we don\u2019t have time to get into this conversation, we don\u2019t want to go there, right? And I think there\u2019s a huge history of philosophy in general, not specifically continental, but I think more continental because philosophers are more open to it.\n\nSo one example I\u2019ll give just to cut to the chase on this is that Schopenhauer, super serious philosopher in the canon of Western philosophy, the Will-to-Life, we\u2019re all stuck between suffering and boredom, but also incorporated all this Eastern stuff. Now the Eastern stuff is accepted because it\u2019s compatible into his system. But not many people know that actually, he said at one point that if any of this is worth anything, it\u2019s because telepathy might be existing, it might exist. So he\u2019s sort of taking these things seriously.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:11:39] When we say these things, let\u2019s make sure, because Schopenhauer is one of those guys who kind of crosses over, right? So a lot of people in the kind of consciousness interested kind of folks reference him, but then a lot of people kind of in the philosophy fields reference him as well. So what is he getting at, in terms of consciousness since that\u2019s a topic that I\u2019m super interested in?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:12:09] In terms of consciousness, what I\u2019d say for Schopenhauer\u2026 I view everything like, and I mean everything through the lens of Kant, Immanuel Kant. Now, it\u2019s very difficult to get across Kant\u2019s philosophy in less than an hour, but I\u2019ll try and just get off the super important bit, which is the difference between the phenomenal and the noumenal or what we would understand as representation. So in terms of our senses, our perception, for Kant, as a human, the way in which the world is presented to us, it is a representation. So when you look at something you\u2019re not looking at the real because it had to be processed by your brain. So it\u2019s represented to you. So Kant\u2019s point is that via our senses, at no point are we dealing with reality.\n\nNow, this is sort of reworded by many, many people after Kant, and there are plenty of spiritualists who\u2019ve come to the same conclusion after Kant. I just generally always think, actually I really do think Kant was the first. He was definitely the first to do this rigorously in The Critique of Pure Reason which is an extremely tough book. But if you just accept that premise, when we move to Schopenhauer, he then incorporates the Veil of Maya, which is this Eastern concept, which I believe comes from the Upanishads, I believe. I\u2019m not a Schopenhauer expert, but the Veil of Maya is something that, as I understand it, can be stripped back.\n\nSo I think the point for Schopenhauer is he readily admits that we can never actually truly attend to the real, because anytime as a human, even if we\u2019re on some amazing drug trip or we think we\u2019ve broken through to the other side, whatever that means, we are always in that Kantian doubt that because we are processing it, we can just never be sure it\u2019s the real. However, I think for Schopenhauer there\u2019s definitely a possibility of communication from that other side.\n\nSo he\u2019s saying that none of this really is important at all unless telepathy is this possibility. And I think what he really means by that is, unless there is a possibility of communication between the absolute real and us, unless we can somehow actually begin to work out what is on this other side of this objective, then what\u2019s the point?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:14:27] Excellent. You know, one of the problems, I guess I struggle with in terms of philosophy, the way that it\u2019s currently practiced, a lot of the people that I\u2019ve listened to on your show, is they seem to be swamped by scientism. So what you just described is really just kind of a reworking of kind of yogic, Vedic kind of philosophy. Re-injected, reinterpreted in this Western philosophical way. Which always to me is interesting on one hand and the rest of the time it\u2019s like, go and reference your sources on that. Because the way that it seems to be swamped is that the fundamental question seems to be the scientific question of consciousness, and that\u2019s why I always start with the absurdity of the claim that we live in today, in terms of\u2026 And we\u2019ll get back to John Michael Greer. On one hand in the time I sound like. Go reference your sources on that a little bit, because the way that it seems to be swamped is that the fundamental question seems to be the scientific question of consciousness.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I always start with the absurdity of the claim that we live in today in terms of, and we\u2019ll get back to John Michael Greer because I think it circles back in a way. And that\u2019s that we live in a science centered culture or really scientism centered culture and the idea that consciousness is an illusion, that you are an epiphenomenon of your brain is central to that in a way that philosophers haven\u2019t processed. And in a lot of times, they\u2019re just kind of following along blindly and making a lot of building on that in ways that they don\u2019t even understand to go back and question the basic, who am I, why am I here, kind of nature of consciousness questions.\n\nSo let\u2019s turn that into a question, because we did this fun survey thing, and I\u2019m really glad that we had a good time doing it and looking at each other\u2019s answers there. What is conscious? Is consciousness fundamental? Is consciousness an epiphenomenon of the brain?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:16:32] Can you expand on what you mean by epiphenomenon of the brain? Just so I know that I\u2019m coming at it at the right angle.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:16:41] I\u2019m sure you are, but just for benefit of people because I always emphasize this point over and over. But if you walk into\u2026 what university did you go to?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:16:58] Staffordshire. So if you go there and you go into the neuroscience department, they\u2019ll tell you exactly what consciousness is and pull out all their machines and they\u2019ll measure it, and they\u2019ll say, here it is, it\u2019s in your brain. So consciousness is 100% a product of brain chemistry, brain electrical activity. It\u2019s in your brain, man. There\u2019s nothing else outside of that. And the thing that I don\u2019t think people fully grok is the extent\u2026 Because what people will say when you confront them with that, they go, Well, there\u2019s a lot of scientists that aren\u2019t that locked into that.\u201d It\u2019s like, no, not really. I mean, that is the dogma. That is the doctrine. If you\u2019re outside of that, then you\u2019re really playing a different game because at the end of the day, that is the understanding of what consciousness is. Consciousness is something that, if you want to get a little bit fancy, it\u2019s an emergent property of the brain, but it\u2019s still brain based.\n\nSo what do you think, is that your understanding of what it means?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:18:09] I would argue that that isn\u2019t an understanding at all, and this is the problem of science and scientism for me. I\u2019d just like to take a minute to just dwell on the scientism thing, and that idea that it\u2019s almost leviathan of culture, it\u2019s our new God, right? It\u2019s the thing that we go to to make sure that everything we\u2019re doing is right.\n\nIn terms of continental philosophy, one of the reasons actually I wanted to study it, is because one of its sort of cornerstones, which is why it\u2019s split from analytic, is that it has this inherent distrust of science and scientism as this overarching way to explain the world, right? Because how you outlined that consciousness is the epiphenomenon of the brain is the same problem that I run into with science all the time, which is this idea of going into the neuroscience department and they say, X, Y, and Z, this is consciousness, or consciousness is in the brain, or it\u2019s an emergent property. Okay, what the hell does that mean? Well, it\u2019s an emergent property. Or they\u2019ll say X amount of atoms does this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It\u2019s okay, that\u2019s fine, but what the hell does it mean? Right?\n\nSo what my point is with that is, it\u2019s very easy for them to describe anything, or explain anything within this recursive language. So it\u2019s like, why does a cancer cell do what it does? Okay. Well, cancer cell is already your own terminology. It does it because of this certain mixture of chemicals, which is also their same terminology. And the way that they\u2019ll justify doing that is\u2026 and you\u2019re always within this circle of them explaining things. And there\u2019s no originary point where you can go there\u2019s the objective truth. It\u2019s sort of a language game for them, it seems to me. And I don\u2019t want to bring everything down to language, but what I would say is, I\u2019d give the example of Heidegger, Martin Heidegger, a continental philosopher, he wrote Being and Time. I\u2019ll try and not make this too complicated.\n\nBut he takes on Descartes, Rene Descartes, his cogito, probably the most famous saying in philosophy arguably, \u201cI think therefore I am.\u201d Now, this is taught in high schools as this saying, which you just say it, and it\u2019s like, I think therefore I am. This is sort of the same thing we\u2019re talking about with consciousness. So you say, I think, therefore I am, and everyone goes, \u201cOh, wow, yeah,\u201d like that means anything.\n\nHeidegger sort of steps back and he says, \u201cWell hang on, what the hell is am? What the hell is being? And it\u2019s just meaningless, I think therefore I am. Okay, well you\u2019ve outlined massive, massive things there which you haven\u2019t taken on. What the hell is I? What is it to think? And what is am, what is it to be? And you haven\u2019t actually addressed any of them. And Heidegger then goes back and addresses being, and I think he does a good job.\n\nSo I would completely disagree with the scientists, what I would say is I\u2019d go back to Kant again in that the only thing we can assess reality from is what we are given, what works, which is this representation. We may very well be stuck in something which isn\u2019t real, but you can\u2019t do the scientist thing and just say, \u201cThis is consciousness, we have it.\u201d I just think that\u2019s a bit of a lie, you have to begin from\u2026 I don\u2019t think Kant\u2019s proposition\u2026 you can\u2019t disprove the proposition, it\u2019s like how can you prove that this is reality if we have to process it first? You have to begin from that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:21:32] I, so I fundamentally agree with you, right?\n\nSo, but the part that I think you know is tricky there is that in a way Kant is introducing. The miracle that we\u2019re trying to avoid in the first place. So it\u2019s almost like, you know, we are fundamentally this experience. That\u2019s all we know. Right. And in when we get into the, that\u2019s why I think the AI stuff and you know, simulation hypothesis stuff is so interesting.\n\nAnd my go-to guy on that is Eckhart. Totally. You know, the modern kind of spiritual teacher where he goes, okay. And someone pushed them on the simulation theory, and he goes, okay, so let\u2019s say we are living in a simulation. You\u2019re still there. You\u2019re still the one experiencing that. So your experience is all you can know without invoking miracles.\n\nSo to a certain extent, the problem I have with con is it\u2019s in a way. To me, it\u2019s backdoor materialism, because it\u2019s saying, okay, you do have this brain, you do have these senses. You are interpreting the outside world as it comes in. So, aha. Therefore you\u2019re one step away from your experience. It\u2019s like, well, you\u2019re assuming now all this kind of stuff that we want to strip away and say, we don\u2019t want to assume.\n\nSo if we start with just, we are. We are here. We are aware we are conscious. It seems to me that that has to be the starting point. Not that we are interpreting being here. Do you get what I mean?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:23:23] Yeah, no, no, no, no, I get it. I get what you mean. but I would say that you can\u2019t ignore that proposition of the fact that your reality is because we, we, we, our understanding is that we do sense it, you know, the way that we, we.\n\nApprehend, this can look say to world vision, sight, hearing, touch. These things are things which have to be processed. So this is an argument that you can\u2019t deny now with the idea of the materialism. That\u2019s a super, super interesting idea because camp has been sort of reformulated by some people to be this of radical materialist in the sense that we exist within a materialism of our own sort of cell.\n\nAnd we\u2019re just sort of stuck in this prison of materialism. and. The way out of that is to do with time in the sense that linear chronic time, it just isn\u2019t real, but it still has to be in time. Everything is in time. So we have this linear time, which is false, but it\u2019s still in time, which implies that in some way, pure time.\n\nIs a gang to us. Now. That sounds very, very complicated,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:24:28] I think it\u2019s just complicated, but it\u2019s kind of self-contradictory right. I mean, it\u2019s like,\n\nJames Ellis: [00:24:32] yeah. Having like two times is it\u2019s really difficult to think about.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:24:36] Yeah. And so what do you, what do you make of, you know, the go-to where we always wind up on this show a lot of times in turn with people who are.\n\nKind of have this science bent because you know, the first book that I wrote by science is wrong about almost everything was really about consciousness and centering around the experiments that have been done. Like what do you make of the quantum physics, you know, early 19 hundreds. Double slit experiment.\n\nSchrodinger\u2019s cat. That\u2019s usually our go-to in terms of pointing to a way that that kind of in a more direct way gets at falsifying. The kind of stuff you\u2019re talking about. These are,\n\nJames Ellis: [00:25:23] these are super, super interesting experiments, but the people who are doing them on using them correctly, well, I mean by that is, I\u2019m just going to stay on the camp line because we\u2019re there and it\u2019s easy to use the way in which we do interpret it.\n\nWell, that\u2019s we are, we are then a subject, right? So we have a subjectivity. The world is a subjective relation to us. The interesting thing about these experiments, these, these quantum experience, double slit experiment, and one recently, which Eric wog I mentioned, and he didn\u2019t seem to what seemed to see what I was trying to get at.\n\nHe mentioned a quantum computer, which supposedly produces. And effect, which affects its because. So it\u2019s a retro causal, so it\u2019s affecting, it\u2019s affecting something that\u2019s beginning. Right. And I said to him, I pose this question is what is the subjectivity of that computer? And in what\u2019s the, you know, if we were to go into the mind of that computer, in what way is it actually.\n\nBeing presented reality because it\u2019s clear to us that it isn\u2019t the Holden to linear time because it can play around with time. And he sort of said, Oh, I don\u2019t, he, he w he, he is assessing it in completely different ways. Completely fine. So I was then thinking, well, we\u2019ve got this computer, which is now sort of completely out of joint in time, because it can play around with what we understand as the future of the past.\n\nAnd that then I think is the easier way to begin to think about time and consciousness. Is that. Our consciousness, the way that we experience reality, if that is how one could define being conscious is completely trapped within. The progressive forward mode of time. Uh, if we have to do anything else, it just wouldn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nOur consciousness is completely like just clutching to that idea of the future and the past and the present. And so then I think any serious question of consciousness needs to begin to, especially when you see things about like this quantum computer is, or what is, you know, very simple question would be is why is it that our consciousness processes time, the way we do, And then the answer to that is very difficult.\n\nIt\u2019s very bleak because I personally, you know, the, the philosopher that I\u2019m about to release a book on in probably less than a week, less than two weeks, Nick land calls it a human security system. You know, it\u2019s a system of security for us because it gives us, you know, as, as almost a resource for something larger than us, it gives us this progression.\n\nbut the past and the present of the future, Only makes sense in linear time, which isn\u2019t real. So they just do not exist in that way. That\u2019s not how time works. and as soon as you know, now we are beginning to play around with things, you know, era, you know, while goes great because you\u2019ve got these things like pre-cognitive dreams, which are basically this documented proof that time doesn\u2019t work, how we think it is in this quantum computer is playing around with, you know, the past and the future and putting them.\n\nYou know, mixing them up. It\u2019s like, okay, we just need the continents, the double slit experiment. We just need to accept time does not work how we think it works. And all it is is if we were to say that humans are, you know, let\u2019s call it linear time. Just linear and humans are humans. Humans interpret time, linearly.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Other things might not, we can\u2019t prove it any, any other way, because we\u2019re stuck in linear linear time.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:28:46] Man again, one, I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s gonna be able to follow this conversation or number two, if they\u2019re how many people are interested in it,\n\nJames Ellis: [00:28:56] spoken about this stuff so much at the time and stuff.\n\nAnd like, I will admit, I, every time I try to think, like, how can I make this simple? How can Nick listen? And it, it\u2019s something your brain really, really struggles with. And I think that\u2019s actually built in to linear time. Is that energy stuff thinking like. No the future isn\u2019t a thing, but it could stuck in it and you just cannot comprehend it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:18] Totally. But there are so many tricky points to that. So are you familiar with the work of Dean Raden in his pre sentiment? Experiments? I\u2019ve\n\nJames Ellis: [00:29:27] heard of Dean Dean Raden, but I haven\u2019t, I haven\u2019t read it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:30] Yeah. You\u2019d be really interested because, so he\u2019s a pair of psychologist,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:37] So with these guys, these guys were on this thing kind of from the beginning, just kind of taking it from another angle and Raden came up with a great experiment and he\u2019s.\n\nSuper smart guy, you know, PhD, bell labs university of Illinois, all this kind of stuff, but now at the ions Institute. So he said, look, I\u2019m going to take an old, tried and true freshmen psychology experiment. Sit you down in front of a computer screen and then show you images. Some of them really horrific.\n\nSome of them, you know, bunnies in a Prairie kind of thing. And I am going to measure, this is the pre sentiment versus pre-cognition, I\u2019m gonna measure your physiological response to those. So these have been done like for a long, long time. He said, let\u2019s look at that data more carefully. And what he found was a response.\n\nBefore the image is presented actually before the image is even selected by the computer. So, boom. So now we\u2019re instantly, you know, pre cognition present. Moment. Time is blown out of the water there. The experiment is replicated over and over again in his lab. At this point it\u2019s been, it\u2019s been one of the most replicated experiments.\n\nGoing, because he\u2019s really driven that home seven labs across the world over 50 times, six Sigma kind of result, you know, from science statistics, it\u2019s over the top in terms of repeatable. And it does totally blow away this idea of linear time as you\u2019re talking about the, the, the, the interesting thing about that to me, there\u2019s a couple of points.\n\nOne. You know, we\u2019re still limited, like in the languages, you said, you said our consciousness, right? So even that is a question, is it our consciousness? Are we in consciousness or are we separate from consciousness? And some philosophers that, you know, Bernardo Castro, dr. Bernardo Castro is one of our go-to guys here.\n\nI think he makes a strong case that. Idealism is a better way of understanding this and that we are in consciousness in some way we can\u2019t fully understand. And the other thing I think that that supports that from a data standpoint is we have all these extended conscious experiences that we have to deal with.\n\nNear-death experience science, hold on. This cat is insisting to go out, stay there, here. Near death, experience science you know, you\u2019re mentioning hallucinogenic kind of experiences, all those things, ITI experiences, they, one characteristic they all have is they seem to bounce us outside of space and time.\n\nRight. So what you\u2019ll hear from a near-death experience person is I was there for a week. I came back, I had been clinically dead for seven minutes. Yeah. So there\u2019s this kind of,\n\nJames Ellis: [00:32:53] I\u2019ve had one of these experiences. I haven\u2019t had a near death experience, but I had one of those sort of weird temporal experiences.\n\nWhen I was younger, someone we used to play this game when we were kids, it\u2019s probably a very British thing. I don\u2019t know if they do it anymore, when you can get your elbow around someone\u2019s neck. And if you. If you get the two, I don\u2019t know what it is. They\u2019ll pass out. And we used to do that when we were drunk, which is a bad idea.\n\nDon\u2019t condone it. We do silly things when it gets anyway, you know, I vividly remember this. I got knocked down and my memory then was to walk from my house. To my friend\u2019s house where I was, which was a 30 minute walk. And that\u2019s all I did when I was knocked out was do this walk. And then when I got to the kitchen in the house, I laid down in the position and work up, but I was 100%.\n\nBut then when I woke up, I was like, Oh God, I\u2019m so sorry. I was apologizing because I thought they\u2019d be worried. Because I was passed out for like 30 minutes. And they were like, what do you mean? What do you mean? I said, I\u2019ve been gone ages. And they said, no, no. You\u2019re like, you know, five seconds. And that was my first time.\n\nI said, okay, time does not work. Time does not work. How you think it works.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:33:51] And as you said, we don\u2019t really know what to do with\n\nJames Ellis: [00:33:55] no, I mean, that\u2019s the question? Where was I, what, what is it? And I mean, I think this is what a lot of people are when I had, Oh, that\u2019s really bad. I forgot his name. We were talking about DMT and he\u2019s sort of saying that this is, I think this is on a practical level.\n\nOne of the best things to do is find a way to prolong and like stabilize. The the time in these areas, because they\u2019re normally so fleeting and chaotic, you can only just sort of grasp onto them and then you\u2019ll, you\u2019ll draw them back. So if you can sort of prolong it, but I think there\u2019s another question there as to the why is it that our brain or consciousness dis allows us to retain what it was we learned in that, that other time?\n\nRight. So most people who\u2019ve done acid say like, they really can\u2019t remember anything of it, but. Something is retained because they learned something from it. So there\u2019s a question of memory and retention is that, you know, in terms of senses, you just can\u2019t remember anything. It\u2019s like a protection, but then other people, you know, report their OCD suddenly gone and they don\u2019t want to smoke cigarettes anymore.\n\nSo there is something has been retained. So I think there\u2019s something interesting. There,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:35:04] are you familiar with the near-death experience science, the work that\u2019s been done there?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:35:11] no, I\u2019m not, no,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:35:13] you know, there\u2019s some of it that, again, just kind of swapping stories now that I think you\u2019d find interesting along these lines that we\u2019re talking about on the one, not particularly jumps to mind, I use it all the time, but it\u2019s from a British, Researcher PhD in nursing.\n\nUh, her name is dr. Penny Sartori and she worked in the critical care unit of a hospital for a long time and came up with a rather novel experiment. That\u2019s been replicated since where she went to people in the cardiac arrest board who had experienced cardiac arrest and had clinically died. And the important thing there is from this back to this.\n\nHard problem of consciousness. You know, consciousness is an emergent property of the brain physiologically after cardiac arrest. We have as good a handle as we\u2019re going to get on what goes on. You know, we\u2019ve studied that for a long time in humans and animals, and we think we understand what\u2019s going on so it could change, but we think we understand, and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s your brain is in a state that can create memories or create.\n\nThese kind of radically radically conscious experiences that people report. So she goes through them and she says, okay, you just died. Tell me what your end, tell me what your resuscitation was like. So she\u2019s got a group of patients, right? So she has 60 patients. 30 of them have had an NDE. 30 of them didn\u2019t have an NDE.\n\nShe goes to all of them. She goes, tell me what your resuscitation is like. The ones that didn\u2019t have an Andy they\u2019re like, lady, what are you talking about? I was dead. Right? Nothing black, nada. I don\u2019t know anything. She goes. Tell me, tell me what you think. Just tell me what you think they go. Okay. Well, I think this and this and that, like out of the TV show, she goes to the 30, that had a near-death experience and they are able to recount it.\n\nExactly. They go crazy. I was immediately, I was shot up and I was on the. Outside corner of the room, or I was right next to the doctor or I was two feet under, but then I moved above my body and I saw them wheel in this cart and they put the paddles on me, but the paddles weren\u2019t working and then they were frantic.\n\nAnd this they\u2019re going into exact detail of what happened to them during resuscitation. So we can deal with the time part, which also comes into it because I have all these extraordinary experiences in like you that come back and go, you know, it was five minutes. It wasn\u2019t, you know, what you think it was like two days or whatever, but it also kind of challenges us in terms of even the question of what.\n\nWe are processing in that extended realm and what we can bring back, because here\u2019s a point where people are bringing back very vivid memories, but then they\u2019re also at times kind of echoing exactly what you\u2019re saying. Then they go because it in Vera, not invariably, but sometimes then people transcend to this other, you know, super extended reality.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll say things like. Every question before I could even verbalize it in my head or even think about it was answered. And I felt like I knew everything. And now I can\u2019t tell you, I just tell you that I have this internal knowing, like you said, and my life is like this and their life. Isn\u2019t always better.\n\nAlso they have integration problems, much higher rate of a divorce, much higher rate of physical problems a lot of times. So there\u2019s the people who\u2019ve really studied the near-death experience and the aftereffects of it. It, it does provide an interesting lens, but it\u2019s not easily kind of chopped and parsed in that.\n\nWhat do you think of that? And then, then we\u2019ll talk more about that.\n\nit\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough. I mean, not, I always gonna assess consciousness.\n\nfrom what we can use. Because otherwise I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a scientific thing. I think that\u2019s a practical, practical thing. So, I mean, this is like going back to Heidegger. I think just to give one example of the way I would begin to assess is saying things such as like between physiology and consciousness.\n\nI think these are sort of unhelpful because they\u2019re already these conceptions that are. Made up bias to explain something else external to us. So it\u2019s like we can sort of buy into our own bias. And I think Heidegger is the one, one of the few philosophers who really, really, really strives to make sure that he is not falling back upon his own biases in and beginning from the absolute base of being his then defines manners does zine, which is just there is or basic sort of.\n\nIt\u2019s bad. I just can\u2019t remember it. I spoke about it just the end of the day, but the, the primary points you remember of design is that Heidi guy begins by saying, okay, well, one thing that is primary to us, which is super, super important about you could say being, well, you could say consciousness is we are beings which investigate are and being.\n\nThat is sort of his starting point is we do know this because we are already what we\u2019re doing when we\u2019re doing this is assessing it. So what does that tell us about things? And I think to begin from there, and I think my problem with it and the reason I probably haven\u2019t read a lot of the consciousness literature is that I think it just does seem to me that so many people have had these experiences where they\u2019ve, they\u2019ve gone elsewhere or done this or this or this they\u2019re so deaf.\n\nThey\u2019re just so different. you know, the only one I\u2019ve heard of is that monks who meditate almost all of them end up believing in reincarnation. And I think it\u2019s, we need to pay attention to when there is a pattern. I think that would be the important thing is to try sort of. Okay. Here\u2019s the big problem, I think is I think the outline, our scientific language is incompatible with where we go and I\u2019ve, you know, in a, in an episode of the hands girding, he said the absolute can\u2019t be known.\n\nAnd I would always take the pessimistic view. Some could say pessimistic or. You know, individuals who have these experiences, they get the knowledge, they get it, they made the, they, they did the bridge. There it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a subjective intuition to them. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way where that communication is going to be universally bridge for us.\n\nI don\u2019t, you know, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s, that\u2019s a thing. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s sort of a cop-out answer and a bit depressing, but that\u2019s where I sort of stand on it. Is that. It\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s not going to happen. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to be able to, sort of logically explain what\u2019s going on over there because we don\u2019t have that.\n\nWe don\u2019t have that compatibility and I, in our minds to be able to do that,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:42:19] See therein lies the problem with, I think, philosophy to a certain extent. No, really. I know I\u2019m maybe poking the bear there a little bit. But it\u2019s like ultimately we do have a need for some grounding, most of us have a need for some grounding in something that is like science, some kind of organized, systematic, empirical way of measuring and figuring out what those measurements mean. So I think we like the idea that we can collect 1000 or 2000 like Dr. Jeffrey Long has, near-death experiences and then catalog them and understand them and say 96% of people that come back from a near-death experience no longer fear dying versus in the general population it\u2019s one of the most pronounced fears that they have. Or 76% of people see deceased relatives. So we want to measure almost by our nature and that draws us to science.\n\nSo when the philosopher comes along and says\u2026 there\u2019s a certain denial of that in a way that I think is hard to take, because we do want to measure, even if we understand the inadequacies of it. What do you think about that James?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:43:49] I mean, I would say that there are philosophers who have actually tackled this problem. [Unclear 00:43:58] is specifically a philosopher of specifics. He always wanted to make sure that we were being very correct about our assessments. And this is one of the things I think Hermitix, my podcast is trying to bridge is that these things are ignored, and they\u2019re drawn back into this sort of suppressive language of philosophy where you do need to a more holistic approach. And the combination between these things is where it begins to get interesting, because if you remain just in the, like in the consciousness sphere, I think they get a bit caught up. For instance, I find Jung so fascinating because that mixture between occultism and someone who really understands the human psyche is far more, dare I say it, progressive in terms of if someone truly wants to heal themselves, let\u2019s say. If you want to heal yourself and you\u2019re just stuck within the language of psychology, well then you\u2019re also stuck with the cures that they offer, which aren\u2019t very good because you\u2019re only remaining in sort of one sphere of existence, and what might be happening to you might be happening on a far greater level. So I think that that\u2019s why.\n\nBut in terms of sort of tackling head on why philosophy is sort of stuck. Yeah, I can\u2019t do that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:45:12] No, and it\u2019s not fair, maybe I was\u2026 Wait, I\u2019ve got to poke you one more time before I let you go here. Poke you twice actually, but with John Michael Greer. A fascinating guy. And you guys, I don\u2019t want to say you guys, but people like him, I so admire in so many ways, and he has taken this whole dialogue about the myth of progress and advanced it in a way that kind of brings an undeniable reality to the situation, that that level zero kind of person you were talking about, just needs to have it jammed in their face, I guess I feel. And maybe that\u2019s what you were saying at the beginning, is you just want to go and go, \u201cBullshit. I mean, you\u2019re just not looking at some of the basic real data that we have on that.\u201d And that\u2019s, I think, to your credit and to some of the folks you have on your show.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub with that. John Michael Greer believed some stuff about global warming that isn\u2019t verifiable scientifically, and worse yet, back to my level two conspiracy thing, seems to have been tainted by forces that want to push that narrative in another way. So like when Al Gore 25 years ago stood on that kind of thing, in the movie and he raised up and he had a little pointer, he said, \u201cThis is where temperatures are, and this is where a CO2 is going.\u201d Well, you can be a level zero kind of person to go, \u201cAl, we\u2019re 25 years on. The oceans have not risen,\u201d which is the only measure we ever have to look at. I mean, where you live they measured the tidal rise and the level of the ocean for hundreds of years, it\u2019s not that complicated to do. It hasn\u2019t risen.\n\nThey go back and they can look at the ice caps and that, and the ice core things they do, they can go back and look at hundreds of thousands of years. And they\u2019ll tell you, long, steady sea levels for a long time, but then, you know, big changes also.\n\nSo when John Michael Greer can\u2019t get that right, that is a red flag for me. He can\u2019t course correct. He can\u2019t say, \u201cGee, I was wrong about global warming, but here\u2019s how I process that now.\u201d\n\nBut the second thing I want him to say is, \u201cI was wrong about global warming because I got bullshitted. I got played by a globalist force that wants to advance certain issues that can only be solved globally.\u201d And whether you like that or not, it is definitely a political kind of thing.\n\nAnd the other side of that is not like good. I\u2019m not saying the fascist kind of nationalist thing is good in any way. I\u2019m just saying, unless we understand those two forces politically and how they\u2019re corrupting the data, how they\u2019re corrupting our ability to try and understand the data, and that is conspiratorial. And unless we can approach it from a conspiratorial standpoint, we don\u2019t have the beginning thing to launch off and make a whole bunch of assumptions about environmentalism and about the myth. Even the Myth of Progress we have to then step back and go, okay, what does that really mean if I\u2019m wrong about global warming? And what does that mean about how I was duped about global warming? Any part of that you want to latch onto?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:48:53] Yeah, specifically with Greer, I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s entirely wrong about global warming, because he comes at it sort of with the angle of Druidry, which is more of a respect for nature, as opposed to the\u2026\n\nOne of my big problems with the climate change argument is that underneath it\u2019s a very selfish argument. It\u2019s like ownership of the globe. Like we need to stop it because it\u2019s our earth. And it\u2019s like, well, even if you don\u2019t stop it, the earth keeps going. Whether or not it\u2019s true, I\u2019m not going to get into that debate, but let\u2019s just play devil\u2019s advocate and say that these things are going to happen, it\u2019s all going to rise up and temperatures go up, oceans rise up etc. etc. We\u2019re only doing that for our own benefit. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s because we care about the earth, because if we care about the earth, a lot of the things that we need to do to stop climate change, we would already do.\n\nSo I think Greer is coming at it more of a, like, instead of saying that the people who would say, \u201cOh, no, it\u2019s fine to cut down the rainforest, but make sure you put up some renewable sources of energy there instead of coal mines.\u201d I think Greer is more along the lines of, \u201cDon\u2019t cut down the forest, we don\u2019t need to. You\u2019re caught up in a consumerist game, which you don\u2019t need to do at all. We don\u2019t know needle this modern tech.\u201d So I\u2019d say he\u2019s coming at it from that direction.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:50:14] And I guess that\u2019s where I\u2019m kind of jumping three levels into the conversation. I got to quit saying levels because I\u2019m going to confuse people, but it\u2019s like, that is the brilliance of the point that he makes. And I think the way you articulated it was particularly good. And that\u2019s the part that I want to go jam in the face of the level zero people. And I also want to jam the science in their face and say, you think you\u2019re driving your Prius and you\u2019re saving the earth, even with inside the confines of your own ridiculous, the scientific understanding of it, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re generating more CO2 with your fricking Prius.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:50:52] But the real point behind all that, I think, that isn\u2019t exposed by a lot of people who are in the kind of soft sciences, including philosophy, but also including a lot of the other soft sciences, is the point that you made that I\u2019m not going to get into the debate about climate change, which is a PSYOP in and of itself, right? Because it\u2019s really about global warming and they\u2019ve managed to kind of change the language, which we all know is a powerful way of kind of controlling\u2026\n\nJames Ellis: [00:51:23] This is one thing, it\u2019s one thing I wanted to just put in that before we go any further. So in linguistic theory, I\u2019ve not a master, I might get this completely wrong. Maybe a linguist might here this and go, \u201cGod this guy is right off.\u201d But in linguistic theory there\u2019s a thing called a free-floating signifier. So a signifier is a word, you signify something. You say a tree and we all have an image of a tree in our head. However, you have these things with free floating signifiers, which are basically signifiers which then, they\u2019re just flowing. They mean so many different things to so many different people, that they\u2019re basically meaningless. Postmodernism is a great one, or even modality is getting in there, right?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:52:09] That\u2019s exactly what I was going to say. Exactly what was going to say, especially with all the corona stuff going on. My point I\u2019m trying to make with this is everything that we\u2019re talking about here is really about control and power. And corona is a great example, because in the news here in the UK you hear things like\u2026 my favorite one they say, and they say it every single news cycle without fail. I would actually put all the money I have on them to say that. Every single daily news broadcast features it, which is, \u201cexperts\u201d. \u201cThe experts agree.\u201d Whoa, back up 10 steps. Which experts? Why are they experts? Why do we need these experts? And they\u2019re talking about coronavirus spreading. Whatever you think about coronavirus, the statement, \u201cthe experts have said this\u201d, is absolutely meaningless. The same with, \u201cthe scientists agree\u201d, or \u201cscience says\u201d. It\u2019s absolutely meaningless.\n\nAnd this is power language because people just offload their personal responsibility and individual responsibility onto these words, and they understand them as things which will keep them safe. The Ernest Becker argument of civilization is there just to lead us away from the fact that we\u2019re going to die. These are also just words to lead us away from the fact that we are still responsible for our own wellbeing, which is why I think people are actually becoming quite ill is because they\u2019re constantly caught up in the paradox of\u2026 they\u2019ve inherited this idea that the scientists are right, but they\u2019re consistently wrong. The same with experts. So you just sort of caught in this absolute hypocrisy.\n\nBut as Deleuze and Guattari say, nothing ever died of contradictions, it just keeps going, this sort of absurd madness, it just keeps going. Nothing dies of contradictions but what do you end up with? This strange oppressive mutation where you just go, \u201cScientists said it.\u201d \u201cWait, so that means we have to do it?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:54:16] Well, you know, I think we\u2019re, we\u2019re running out of time. You have a time limit.\n\nJames Ellis: [00:54:20] I\u2019ve got about 10 more minutes.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:54:22] Okay. Well then I will throw out the question. Because in a way, what we\u2019re both trying to do here, and there are so many points that you just made that I could go, but how do we find terra firma? How do we find the ground that we stand on, from where we can at least approach some of these topics? Like, when you threw out the fear of death thing, in a way I almost feel like you brushed over that too quickly. It is fundamentally maybe the only thing that is really at play here.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:55:01] So we can\u2019t go to the next thing and say, and this is another\u2026 No, it\u2019s like internally that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. From the Eastern perspective that\u2019s how we\u2019ve built all these [unclear 00:55:14] that constitute our definition of who we are.\n\nJames Ellis: [00:55:18] This is the huge problem of the modern day, is that the only reason things can mean anything is if they\u2019re put in a finite framework, which is eventually going to end. What does your family mean if you know that one day you\u2019re going to die? Which then makes you think, right, so I need to, you know, build up something for them and I need to teach these lessons and keep that going and build a great family. You know, what does this project mean if one day I\u2019m not going to be here, or the project would end?\n\nThe problem is it\u2019s a schizophrenic problem because the schizophrenic doesn\u2019t adhere to any of this. So the schizophrenic goes beyond death because it doesn\u2019t have anything that\u2019s going to die. And this is the problem of the modern day, is that everything that we\u2019re in, all institutions, the media, social media, everything teaches us to live, not in the present in the Eastern sense, but in the, what I call the nano present, right? Just the smallest iteration of a news cycle. Like, what are we talking about today? This, this, this, this. Right, you\u2019ve forgotten about\u2026 I always list things that people are probably\u2026 like Brexit. It\u2019s gone. Or Black Lives Matter before corona. Or corona and now it\u2019s the election and it\u2019s like all these things are just forgotten in an instant. And this really removes the position of purpose and meaning for man because you completely forget that you exist on a finite timescale. We need to remember that, I think it\u2019s important, super, super important to remember that. But modernity hates death and suffering, it sees them as bugs, not features of reality, it wants to get rid of them.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:56:57] I don\u2019t disagree with you on that, I just wonder if the problem is more fundamental. And getting back to the kind of nature of consciousness question, you know, one of the spiritual questions, two of the spiritual kind of little quips that I like is one, you know, the spiritual path is easy for one with no preferences. And the related one to that is, who am I and who have I become?\n\nSo we are all making these assessments about what we like, what we don\u2019t like, who we are, and that has created this image of who we are. So I almost feel like when we say modernity, I get it, we all understand it. We all understand the oppressive force, but it\u2019s really just a substitute for the experience that a particular\u2026 I\u2019m drawn to some of the Eastern philosophies, have kind of pointed out all along. It\u2019s like, no, man, it\u2019s not really modernity, you just created this shit. You\u2019ve created this shit by being so attached to one, the thoughts that you\u2019ve created, but two, the experiences that you\u2019ve had, that you misinterpreted, right? You know, it\u2019s the classic, you see the stick on the ground on your walk and you think it\u2019s a snake and then you recoil because you thought there was a snake on the ground. There wasn\u2019t a fucking snake there, but you\u2019ve processed it now as a snake and you\u2019re going to have to un-process that if there is some getting clean that is desirable at some point.\n\nSo is the Eastern approach, does it kind of jump over a lot of these perceived problems with modernity and Myth of Progress kind of issues?\n\nJames Ellis: [00:58:48] I think it does, but I agree with\u2026 John Michael Greer says that people should only do drugs from their nation, from where they were brought up, from their area of the world. So if you\u2019re European, you should just sort of drink alcohol and etc. etc.\n\nI think the same is true of spiritual traditions and any Westerner who I\u2019ve met, who\u2019s really like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m really into Buddhism,\u201d it\u2019s always a sort of tainted Buddhism. And I think that that spirituality brushes over all that stuff because they\u2019re just different. They are actually quite different in a good way, in a good way. But I think when Westerners take that on, they usually bastardize it and find a way to have this, you know, this still Western like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m a Buddhist,\u201d but you still within modernity, and it just turns into this strange thing.\n\nSo I would say, if you have a spiritual conclusion in mind in which you\u2019re deconstructing modernity etc. you can do that from the position of the Westerner, and I think you have to do that from the position of the Westerner because instead of introducing a new language like you are with Buddhism and a new idea, you begin to deconstruct what it is you\u2019ve built yourself. Which I think is a more productive thing to do as opposed to just, right, I\u2019ve got this problem, instead of deconstructing the problem itself with what I\u2019ve built, I\u2019ll just throw something on top of it. No, you don\u2019t need that other thing. Why did you build up this idea that you need a mortgage or whatever it is? Why do you feel like you need the super-duper mattress? Why in society is it weird to sleep on the floor, for instance? And begin there.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:00:33] Again, our guest has been James Ellis, the very, very imaginative and deep, deep thinker, host of Hermitix podcast. And let\u2019s pull up his blog there that you\u2019re going to want to check out, Meta-Nomad.\n\nSo James, so awesome talking to you, and like I said, let\u2019s make this part one of an ongoing dialogue, super funny. I appreciate it.\n\nThanks again to James Ellis for joining me today on Skeptiko. One question I\u2019d tee up from this interview, is philosophy swamped by science? Is their inability to dive in, deep dive the way we\u2019ve been talking about on the show for a while, does that undermine some of their strongest positions?\n\nI don\u2019t know, James makes a strong case for the deep-thinking philosopher that he is, and he\u2019s pulling together a lot of interesting pieces from a perspective that\u2019s quite unique. So maybe that\u2019s the counter punch to that?\n\nLet me know your thoughts. Of course, the place to do it as the Skeptiko Forum. Come join me over there. Lots of great shows coming up. Stay with me for all of that. Until next time, take care, bye for now.\n\nby the way, you know, if you look down in the corner here, there\u2019s a little click button for Barnes and Noble and Amazon and if you click Amazon, you\u2019ll see that a page is not found. This is a book that has been banned on Amazon, imagine that. I think that\u2019s, that might be the most interesting part of this story. So the central, the central premise of Tom\u2019s book, The Contagion Myth, is that Coronavirus doesn\u2019t exist. Which, I have to say when I first heard it during my interview with David Ike who is someone who I really respect but I know David doesn\u2019t always dig into the science or get the science right but when I first heard it, it had a real Flat Earth kind of ring to it like, you know, like a reverse conspiracy, over the top conspiracy claim. So when one of your representatives Dr. Cowan pinged me and said, Hey, would you like to have a chat with this guy? I jumped at the opportunity because I think this is really an interesting topic to talk about so thanks for joining me. Dr. Tom Cowan: 2:55 Thank you, it\u2019s actually just a few corrections it\u2019s Cowan not Cohen. Alex Tsakiris: 3:01 Did i say C- I keep saying that. Yeah, It\u2019s Cowan I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, It\u2019s Cowan, I\u2019m sorry. Dr. Tom Cowan: 3:06 But you can call me Tom if that will make it easier. Alex Tsakiris: 3:09 I will Tom. Dr. Tom Cowan: 3:09 I think just as a note, it was not actually published by Simon and Schuster, it was published by a company called Skyhorse and I think Simon and Schuster is technically the distributor, not the publisher. Alex Tsakiris : 3:24 Okay, well, I just think it\u2019s fascinating that Simon and Schuster put their name on the book and yet it\u2019s a book that\u2019s been banned by Amazon. I think that\u2019s amazing. But I do have to say, I mean, just kind of right to it the central premise that Coronavirus hasn\u2019t been isolated in a lab is just, i mean, you\u2019re not serious about that are you? I mean, that\u2019s just kind of flat earth thing. I got so many I can show you some of the Dr. Tom Cowan: 3:57 So let me start that if I would by,if I can just. Alex Tsakiris: 4:06 Yeah, go ahead. Dr. Tom Cowan: 4:08 If I can respond to that and I\u2019ll tell you how this came about if you want but let me just read from this was a January 2020 CDC bulletin on basically making testing for, sorry, this was a published,sorry, this was published in European surveillance which is a major European epidemiology journal and they say quote, this is January 2020, quote the ongoing outbreak of recently emerged novel Coronavirus poses a challenge to public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable. Further, they say in the problem of developing a test because these virologists were tasked with developing a test for this virus and again let me quote from the actual study. This is in peer reviewed a scientific literature, quote, we aim to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. In other words, they were tasked and they spoke about the challenge of developing a test when they actually didn\u2019t have any virus available to make a test for and I can imagine that, that was in fact challenging because if somebody said I want you to make a test for a unicorn it would be nice to at least see the unicorn. Now, that\u2019s not the only one because in the CDC bulletin from 2020 now we\u2019re talking July, so this is later. This is the CDC and again, I\u2019ll quote, since no quantified virus isolates of this 2019 star\u2019s code to virus are currently available. In other words that\u2019s the CDC saying we have no isolates, we have never isolated purified and seen this virus. So I could go on because a group of us who\u2019ve been working on this actually emailed and communicated with the six top articles that say they isolated and characterized and purified the virus and in writing all of them admitted that they never actually isolated and purified the virus in writing. So those are simply the facts and I can tell you how we got there if you want but I\u2019ll let you sort of guide the conversation here. Alex Tsakiris: 6:54 Okay, well, this guy who I thought was interesting because he\u2019s from the University of Saskatchewan and I like saying Saskatchewan so I use him, but he\u2019s also one of the top virologist in the world and you know, Darrell, what\u2019s his name? Fel zorana, Bell Serrano, he\u2019s up there in Saskatchewan. So he isolated the virus. But more importantly, like in 2006.. Dr. Tom Cowan: 7:19 I doubt that he isolated the virus. Alex Tsakiris: 7:21 Okay.. Dr. Tom Cowan: 7:22 If he did he should immediately let the CDC know that he did that because the CDC is under the impression that they actually have never isolated the virus. Alex Tsakiris: 7:33 Well i don\u2019t think, there he is in his lab, i don\u2019t think he\u2019s keeping it a secret Dr. Tom Cowan: 7:40 Well then i can tell you, i could review his paper and demonstrate that in fact he couldn\u2019t possibly have isolated this virus. Alex Tsakiris: 7:50 There we go, there we go. I love it. So you realize this is a guy published in Nature, obviously, one of the top science journals in the world in 2016 mind you, on his work he\u2019s virologist and you know, part of the reason I guess why he got pulled into the COVID thing is he did all this work with camels strangely enough you know there\u2019s all these viruses and animals that sometime crossover and there\u2019s all these viruses in these camels that looked like the SARS. So he was over there studying that for years and years. He\u2019s an expert, he has a lab like this and he has all these people in his lab and the idea that he is so grossly incompetent, which would really be, we would have you know, you guys up there in Canada, like Matt, we could go sue this guy, probably make millions if he is falsely claiming that he got the material, which he said was very difficult to get at the beginning and then he isolated the virus, if he\u2019s falsely making that claim, gosh, let\u2019s go at him. But again, it just doesn\u2019t seem likely that this guy, in this lab published in Nature woke up one day and kissed his wife, goodbye and said, Okay, now I\u2019m going to go falsify a bunch of science that I built my whole reputation and my whole life on. Dr. Tom Cowan: 9:13 All i have to tell you is, again, we have the six most important papers all of which claim they isolated and purified the SARS code to virus. Some of them were published in Nature and New England Journal of Medicine and my team actually emailed them because we could tell from the paper that there was no possible way they isolated the virus. All you have to do is actually, because I could describe if you want, how we isolate and demonstrate a purified virus, it\u2019s very clear that they didn\u2019t do that. The reason they didn\u2019t do it is because they changed the rules. So whether he\u2019s deliberately doing that Or not I don\u2019t know. But they all admitted publicly and in writing, which you could tell from the from the papers that they didn\u2019t ,couldn\u2019t possibly have isolated and purified the virus. Alex Tsakiris: 10:14 That just well,what did Darrell say when you talk to him? Dr. Tom Cowan: 10:20 I don\u2019t remember whether we talked to him or not. I don\u2019t remember if he was the lead author of one of these six papers. Alex Tsakiris: 10:27 But he\u2019s one of the top for anything Dr. Tom Cowan: 10:30 They say the same thing all the time. Alex Tsakiris: 10:31 The idea that there\u2019s these virologist, professional virologist, like I said. Dr. Tom Cowan: 10:37 Let me interrupt you here because if we\u2019re going to be talking about who said what, then this conversation is not going to be productive. If we want to talk about the science and how a virologist demonstrates isolation and purification then your listeners might learn something, if you want to try to ask me why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, I have no idea. Because I\u2019ve never talked to the guy. Alex Tsakiris: 11:06 Yeah, but the point is, he\u2019s saying you\u2019re full of crap. He\u2019s saying I got a sample, I isolated the virus. He\u2019s even saying that since he does work with animals that he then, you know, injected the virus that he isolated into a certain species of monkeys which I don\u2019t know how I feel about that but these monkeys then demonstrated all the symptoms of COVID. So no, he\u2019s saying.. Dr. Tom Cowan: 11:33 I can tell from just this, looking at this highlight that you\u2019re putting there and that his way of isolating is using surrogate markers which are completely invalid as anybody who understands the science would know. Alex Tsakiris: 11:50 So this guy doesn\u2019t understand the science that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying? Dr. Tom Cowan: 11:53 He has a misconception. Alex Tsakiris: 11:57 So this guy.. Dr. Tom Cowan: 11:58 I can tell you exactly why he has a misconception if you want. If you don\u2019t want, you can just stay with an argument about who\u2019s right and then nobody will get anywhere. Alex Tsakiris: 12:10 Well, Tom, Dr. Tom, that\u2019s what this is, It\u2019s an argument about who\u2019s right and you\u2019re claiming you\u2019re right and this guy\u2019s claiming he\u2019s right ,so I don\u2019t know how we would break it down any other way. But this guy who published .. Dr. Tom Cowan: 12:25 I can tell you how to break it down. Alex Tsakiris: 12:27 This guy who, No, this is how science is done. That\u2019s why virologist say we got this thousands of virologists around the world who study this stuff. Why are these people claiming that none of these folks know what they\u2019re doing? Or you\u2019re claiming they\u2019re all part of some conspiracy, which, hey, the reason I\u2019m concerned about this is there are some really legitimate questions about how this COVID thing has been rolled out, the science behind it, how it\u2019s used to prop it up and I am really, really concerned about the way science has been mishandled on the COVID thing. But this idea that they haven\u2019t isolated the virus, I mean, flat earth stuff. Dr. Tom Cowan: 13:16 I think we\u2019re at an impasse here. Alex Tsakiris: 13:19 Okay, probably. Alex Tsakiris : 13:23 Impasse, indeed. I\u2019m going to cut it off there and I do want to thank Dr. Tom Cowan for joining me today on Skeptiko. I think it\u2019s great that he was willing to come on in and talk about this stuff and I\u2019m certainly supportive of him having that opportunity. I can\u2019t believe that Amazon banned his book, you know, later we talked about that. He said, other best selling books on Amazon. I don\u2019t care what you think of this guy\u2019s interpretation of the science. We have reached an absolute new level within this cancel culture where people are up in arms that they\u2019re banning books! just unbelievable. But the other point, I guess, that I would rant on, and I probably will rant on in future episodes because it\u2019s going to be coming up again and again, is this flat earth science thing and one of the advantages I think I have in going through the drills with Skeptiko, from the beginning, from Jump Street with Dean Raiden and that phony baloney, Yale neurologists skeptic, Dr. Steve Novella, do you remember one of the very first episodes of Skeptical where they, him and Dr. Ray Hyman from Oregon, since deceased were laughing about Dean Raiden and laughing about his work, laughing about his published research and I remember I told you at the time and I told you in the first book that I wrote that I\u2019m interviewing these guys and I\u2019m like, Oh, shit, they\u2019re right in dmraid must be wrong, because no way they\u2019d be laughing at this guy science. The point is, if you\u2019re not always on that edge of doubting whether or not this edgy science, this frontier science is right or wrong, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really in the game. But the flip side of that, in my opinion, is this Dr. Tom Cowan, you haven\u2019t proven it to me, no time? the job is for you to prove it to us, if you believe against all common sense and logic that this virus hasn\u2019t been isolated, even though they\u2019re spending billions and billions of dollars developing a vaccine, which would be impossible if they hadn\u2019t isolated the virus and even though they\u2019re competing not only within these multinational big farmer companies but they\u2019re competing with other countries, like China has a vaccine, Russia has a vaccine, they\u2019re all trying to get a leg up on the other ones to get a competitive advantage. All that is dependent on the idea that they have successfully isolated the virus at the very minimum. So if you\u2019re going to go against that, if you\u2019re going to be Tom Cowan, if you\u2019re going to be quacky Andrew Kaufman and you\u2019re going to stand up and say that you can\u2019t do this flat earth thing where you say, oh, we\u2019ll prove it to me, prove it to my satisfaction that you\u2019ve isolated the virus. No, you prove it to us. You stand up like Dean Raiden stood up and do 20-30 experiments, publish them in peer reviewed journals, get other labs to replicate it, get other people with inside the community to support your work. Forget this flat earth, you got to prove it to me because I can\u2019t see it this extreme empiricism. It\u2019s just a joke and I feel like I need to point it out. I did another interview with Matt Blair, who was kind of riding shotgun in this one but didn\u2019t say much and, uh, kind of point you to that in the notes and you can see it. It\u2019s just kind of one of my personal little crusades here because I think there\u2019s so many interesting, real, hard conspiratorial questions regarding COVID. But this notion that they haven\u2019t isolated the virus, to me, that seems like, it just seems like a psyop to me, it just unknowingly I mean Cowan doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a psyop, Kaufman doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s a psyop, but they\u2019re letting that idea out there just to divide the conspiratorial community if you will into thinking Flat Earth bullshit. Okay, that\u2019s a long rant I never usually do these but I felt it necessary in this case. If you have any thoughts on that? let me know I\u2019m dying to hear. Otherwise, stick around. I got some more good Skeptiko\u2019s coming up. They won\u2019t all be like this one. Take care.
