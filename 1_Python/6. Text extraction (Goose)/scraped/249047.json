The plans they have for our future fit like a glove with what the John wrote in Revelation 13:15-18:\n\n\"And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.\"\n\nPlease understand that this passage does not reach its complete fulfillment halfway until through the seven-year Tribulation, well after the Rapture of the church. What we see today is NOT the mark of the beast, but it's most certainly both a prelude to and a conditioning for it.\n\nJohn 8:44 is another key passage that's essential for understanding the agenda of the elite powerbrokers. Though not a prophecy, it speaks directly to what we see in our world today because the devil and his demons control the globalists who wield great power in the governments of the world as well as in the business world.\n\n\"You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\"\n\nThe Luciferian elite of our day have two basic goals: First, they plan to reduce the world's population and second, they intend to deceive and control those who remain through the means of transhumanism. Both objectives are essential to their final goal of forming a one-world government over which they hope to rule and enslave humanity.\n\nTranshumanism is the combining of machines and human beings with the intent to monitor our behavior so they can later control our behavior and even our thoughts.\n\nWikipedia describes it this way:\n\n\"Transhumanism is a philosophical movement, the proponents of which advocate and predict the enhancement of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies able to greatly enhance longevity, mood and cognitive abilities . . . Some transhumanists believe that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the current condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.\"\n\nLeading the way to bring about this change is a group called the World Economic Forum (WEF) with Klaus Schwab as its founder and CEO. Here is a quote from the group's website regarding the changes they wish to impose on the world:\n\n\"The Fourth Industrial Revolution [the WEF term for transhumanism] represents a fundamental change in the way we live, work and relate to one another. It is a new chapter in human development, enabled by extraordinary technology advances commensurate with those of the first, second and third industrial revolutions. These advances are merging the physical, digital and biological worlds in ways that create both huge promise and potential peril. The speed, breadth and depth of this revolution is forcing us to rethink how countries develop, how organizations create value and even what it means to be human.\"\n\nThe globalists of our day do not hide their objectives; they are in plain sight for all to see if one is willing to investigate. Is it not shocking that they intend for us to \"rethink . . . what it means to be human?\" The theme of merging \"the physical, digital and biological worlds\" runs through many of the articles on the WEF website. They do not keep their evil intentions a secret, but openly broadcast them to all who are paying attention.\n\nOn November 20, 2017, an article appeared on Forbes website entitled, Transhumanism and The Future of Humanity: 7 Ways the World Will Change By 2030. The following quote from it appears under the heading of \"Our bodies will be augmented.\"\n\n\"The coming years will usher in a number of body augmentation capabilities that will enable humans to be smarter, stronger, and more capable than we are today. Wearables will be one form of body augmentation, but they will far surpass the fitness trackers of today. . . . We will also see increased use of implants ranging from brain microchips and neural lace to mind-controlled prosthesis and subdermal RFID chips that allow users to unlock doors or computer passwords with the wave of a hand. However, the most powerful body augmentation will come from biological augmentation as a result of increased insight into our genomes, advances in IVF technology that may allow us to select the most intelligent embryos, and powerful CRISPR gene-editing technology which may one day give us the ability to eliminate all heritable diseases.\n\nThese body augmentation capabilities will give rise to humans that are more resilient, optimized and continually monitored.\"\n\nPlease note that the \"CRISPR gene-editing technology\" that the writer of the Forbes article says will someday augment our bodies is exactly how the experts today describe the mRNA injections, AKA \"COVID-19 vaccines.\" What the Forbes article predicted in 2017 would eventually lead to the altering of humans became a reality in 2020-21 with the emergence of \"CRISPR\" gene therapy injections from Pfizer, Moderna, and other pharmaceutical companies.\n\nNotice how the writer of the article stresses the positive possibilities of the \"CRISPR\" gene therapy injections as eliminating \"all heritable diseases\" before telling us that they will also lead to the continual monitoring of people. The transhumanists promise great advancements that will benefit humanity, but their final objective is control such as in buying and selling.\n\nAs further evidence of the long-range planning behind what we see today, ponder this quote from Aldous Huxley, a philosopher and author, at the California Medical School in 1961:\n\n\"There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.\"\n\nThough spoken over sixty years ago, these words represent the blueprint from which the globalists operate today. What Huxley talked about in 1961 has now become reality. \"Pharmaceutical methods\" have become the weapon of choice for those seeking to change humanity by combining humans with machines. What we see is just the beginning, drugs will continue to play an essential role leading to the mark of the beast.\n\nAs evidence that transhumanism already resides on the doorstep of our world, please consider these three related initiatives that are opening the door for what we see depicted in Revelation 13:6-18.\n\n1. PATENT WO2020060606: THE TECHNOLOGY OF CONTROLLING THE BUYING AND SELLING\n\nMicrosoft, along with Bill Gates, obtained this international patent in 2020: Patent WO2020060606 - Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data. Yes, this patent is real as is its number.\n\nHere is the legal description of the patent:\n\n\"Human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system. A server may provide a task to a device of a user which is communicatively coupled to the server. A sensor communicatively coupled to or comprised in the device of the user may sense body activity of the user. Body activity data may be generated based on the sensed body activity of the user. The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.\"\n\nThis patent envisions the use of a sensor that detects \"the body activity of the user\" and reports it to an outside digital computing source. The behavior of the individual then becomes the basis for his or her award of \"cryptocurrency.\" The reward or lack thereof results from what the senor reports regarding the conduct of the individual.\n\nNow imagine a world where all currency exists digitally, and that day is coming, and your receipt of it does not come entirely from the fruit of your labor, but from behaving according to the desires of a distant governing body that sets the parameters by which the computing source rewards you. They will know your every move because your activity is monitored by a chip inside you or a mark on your body.\n\nThis is the future envisioned by Patent WO2020060606 - Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data.\n\n2. ID2020: INCLUDING THE \"SMALL\" AND THE \"POOR\" IN THE ANTICHRIST'S PROGRAM\n\nID2020 is another Bill Gates and Microsoft initiative that seeks to provide 1.1 billion people in the world with the legal identification that they currently lack; it will give them a digital ID along with a vaccine, of course. They will be one and the same.\n\nHere is a description of ID2020 from the official Microsoft blog, dated January 22, 2018:\n\nAs discussions begin this week at the World Economic Forum, creating universal access to identity is an issue at the top of Microsoft's agenda, and we think technology can be a powerful tool to tackle this challenge. It was last summer that Microsoft took a first step, collaborating with Accenture and Avanade on a blockchain-based identity prototype on Microsoft Azure. Together, we pursued this work in support of the ID2020 Alliance - a global public-private partnership dedicated to aiding the 1.1 billion people around the world who lack any legal form of identity. To say that we were encouraged by its mission would be an understatement. We were inspired by it.\n\nNotice the players include the World Economic Forum (WEF) that vigorously promotes both the Great Reset and transhumanism. ID2020 is not some isolated initiative that does not relate to transhumanism or the effort of the globalists to control people. It's all about identifying everyone on earth so the globalists can include them into their system of worldwide control, vaccinate them, and thereby continually monitor and dictate their behavior.\n\nSo far, we have looked at the plans of the globalists to incorporate everyone on the planet into their scheme of controlling the flow of digital currency. But how do they intend to do this?\n\n\"Quantum dot\" technology may answer that question; I believe this will become the means for the antichrist to deliver his infamous mark and accompanying vaccine to the population of the world. By it, he will mark those who belong to him by tattooing their right hand or forehead.\n\nA diagram of how the \"Quantum Dot\" will inject a vaccine and leave a tattoo on the skin at the same time.\n\nAccording to Bill Gates, quantum dot delivery of a future vaccines will connect the recipient to an external digital source via the ID2020 technology to verify the vaccination. Initially, this will vaccinate the individual as well as leave a tattoo, perhaps visible, that will electronically reveal his or her vaccine status.\n\nTogether, these three initiatives lay out a clear path to what will become the \"mark of the beast\" by the halfway point of the tribulation. By then, the electronic tattoo will appear on one's forehead and hand and reveal one's ability to buy and sell as well as to the degree they are able to participate in such activities.\n\nLater, this tattoo will be the only means of participating in market of goods and services.\n\nBefore the dawn of this century, it would have taken an army of several hundred thousand to control the buying the selling across the planet and even then, it would not have been foolproof. Now with artificial intelligence and all the many advances related to transhumanism, the technology exists for one person to do this.\n\nThat person will be the antichrist. The globalists will have everything in place before he steps onto the world stage. Because of the speed at which technology and transhumanism are advancing, everything will be ready for him when the time comes for him to appear on the world's stage.", "opengraph": {"title": "Transhumanism: Marching Towards The Mark Of The Beast", "type": "article", "description": "Before the dawn of this century, it would have taken an army of several hundred thousand to control the buying the selling across the planet and even then, it would not have been foolproof.
