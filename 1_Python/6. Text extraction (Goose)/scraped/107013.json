Here\u2019s how to be a more eco friendly pet owner\n\nWe here at Eluxe animals, both wild and domestic. There has undoubtedly been a strong connection between humans and animals since the dawn of civilisation. And as every pet owner knows, living closely with the wee beasties can enrich your life like nothing else.\n\nBut just like us, they have a carbon footprint that damages the planet, too. Sure, you may keep the thermostat down, drive a hybrid and buy organic. But \u2013 how green is your pet?\n\nI\u2019ve learned that taking proper care of your animal is not only better for the Earth, but it\u2019s better for the health of your faithful companion, too.\n\nHere are some of my best tips for how to be a more eco friendly pet owner, whether you have a dog, cat, or other beastie.\n\nHow to Be A More Eco Friendly Pet Owner\n\n1. Think About Their Food\n\nThe first step in how to be a more eco friendly pet owner is to think about their food.\n\nAs any good vegan knows, beef and pork production is extremely resource-heavy, polluting waterways with animal waste and taking much space for rearing. So try to feed your pet chicken or fish based food instead. Better yet, make your pet\u2019s food yourself, using raw meats, vegetables and whole grains for dog food. Only meat and fish should be used for cat food, as felines should mainly be carnivorous.\n\nAnother benefit of homemade pet food is the many food tins you\u2019ll forego. Often at least one ever single day of your pet\u2019s lifespan! It may not seem like much to you every day, but did considering there are an estimated 69, 926, 000 dog and 74,059, 000 cat owners in the USA alone, that\u2019s around being thrown out or recycled per year. In America only!\n\nSo to be an eco friendly pet owner, do be sure to buy pet feed in bulk to avoid filling landfill and recycling centres with packaging, and mix your dog\u2019s food with rice or table scraps whenever possible to avoid buying more packaged, commercial food.\n\nIf you walk your dog in the streets, biodegradable bags from a company like www.theflushablebag.com or www.poopbags.com are essential\u2013otherwise, the bags won\u2019t decompose, and their trapped, smelly contents will never get a chance to return to the ground. Composting pet poop is best, in a pet-waste composter. Make sure to separate it from your vegetable garden, though, as composters don\u2019t heat up enough to kill E. coli, which could contaminate your greens.\n\nWhile cats may take care of their own \u2018business\u2019, kitty litter is a huge source of waste. Americans alone discard an estimated two to four million tonnes of it per year. And what\u2019s more, buying clumping litter for your kitty to poop into presents several serious eco-hazards.\n\nMost of it is clay-based, and clay strip-mining consumes mountains, creating infertile waste rock and adversely impacting vegetation and water resources. It also necessitates deforestation, which destroys biodiversity and promotes global warming.\n\nClay sediment also contains carcinogenic silica dust, which, when inhaled, can cause upper respiratory tract problems in cats and people. And clay won\u2019t break down any further than the mineral that it is, so it just accumulates in landfills as people throw out more and more kitty litter.\n\nIf that\u2019s not bad enough, the clay-based clumping agent, sodium bentonite, is potentially fatal to Fluffy if ingested. It can swell up to fifteen times its original volume and clog the cat\u2019s gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe greenest litter for your kitty contains reclaimed products or post-consumer waste, like wood shavings, sawdust or old newspapers. Baking soda is odour-absorbent, as is wheat-based litter. Corn and other vegetable derivatives also make effective, biodegradable litters.\n\nWe all try to choose the right kind of dog and cat for our lifestyle. And we love our pets so much, we tend to coddle them like little humans. We buy them gifts for holidays and other special occasions, for example. But is this extra shopping really necessary? While it\u2019s nice to give your pet a treat, they really don\u2019t care whether you get them a handcrafted leather ball from Louis Vuitton or throw them a dead tennis ball you found in the bin. They just want to play!\n\nTinfoil balls, string, elastic bands, long feathers and organic catnip are great \u2018gifts\u2019 for Fluffy. A good, strong stick, chew toys (byproducts from the meat industry) and old balls and rope are always welcome for Fido.\n\nKeep in mind too that if you buy your pet plastic based toys, not only is this harmful for the environment, but they could hurt your pet, too. Especially if they\u2019re chewing on them. A recent study from the Environmental Working Group found that pets carry around 48 different industrial chemicals in their bodies, many of which are at higher levels than those found in humans.\n\u2022 plastic toys, food packaging, pet shampoos and even some medicines\n\u2022 flame retardants found in pet beds, carpeting (which they are closer to daily) and some pet \u2018clothing\u2019\n\u2022 chemicals found in floor cleaners and lawn pesticides (which cats in particular will lick off when they clean their paws)\n\u2022 plasticisers in the lining of tinned food\n\nProlonged exposure to these chemicals can cause hormonal problems, poor coat conditions, cancer, and other serious conditions. So when considering how to be a more eco friendly pet owner, it\u2019s essential to think about how clean your floors and carpets, too.\n\nAlso: use a natural product and use no chemicals on your grass and in your garden. It\u2019s also a good idea to only buy organic bedding for your pets (see below for some ideas).\n\nNote that cats in particular are prone to thyroid issues as they age, and some experts suspect this could be due to the BPA lining their food tins. All the more reason to follow my eco friendly pet advice on food, above.\n\nAnother thing to consider when learning how to be a more eco friendly pet owner is wildlife.\n\nMaybe your dog is a Chihuahua named Charro and she wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. Even so, when she excitedly barks at and chases squirrels, rabbits and birds in their natural habitats, it could do more harm than you\u2019d imagine! These animals are nervous by nature, and become highly stressed when chased by other animals. Obviously!\n\nBut that\u2019s not the worst damage dogs can do \u2013 they spread disease, too. For example, the Siberian tiger, which is already endangered, has recently become even more threatened by contracting Canine Distemper Virus, spread by dogs. The virus has already devastated several other species, ranging from lions to seals, after having been spread in the wild by dogs. If your animals are outdoors at all, it\u2019s to get your cat or dog vaccinated. Not only to protect their own health, but the health of wild animals around them, too.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get us started on cats. Some say domestic cats are the most important cause of the demise of certain songbirds. Consider your own playful housecat, whom you frequently let out to roam overnight. Rested and well fed, it\u2019s in fine fighting form. And if so inclined, it might kill or harm on average a night. While the birds are ! Like some kind of psycho serial killer.\n\nYour cat may not bring those birds home, so you\u2019d never know it. But to give an example of just how devastating cats can be to wildlife, it has been documented that in Canada alone, domestic cats kill 60-70 wild birds a year. That\u2019s not to mention all the mice and other small mammals that may fall victim to your cuddly little Fluffy.\n\nMoral of the story: . It\u2019s safer for them, and the wildlife population, too. But if you insist on letting your cat outside, ensure she wears a cat bib. Bells are not effective at stopping her from killing wildlife, but bibs are more proven to do so. Even if they look a little strange.\n\nYet another good reason to keep cats indoors is to avoid their getting fleas and other parasites. There is no easy to rid an animal of these naturally. Chemical solutions pollute not only your home and pet with toxic chemicals, but waterways and soil, too, when the products are discarded.\n\nThere some greener products you can use, such as natural flea collars and herbal flea repellent sachets. These are safe enough to use in your pet\u2019s bedding, carpeting, and furniture. But these don\u2019t always work as well as chemicals, and prevention is really better than cure. In other words? Keep dogs away from wild wooded spaces, and keep cats inside.\n\nFinally, possibly the very best thing you can do when learning how to be a more eco friendly pet owner is to ensure your pet is neutered. Given the literal millions of stray dogs and cats suffering around the world, it\u2019s not to ensure your pet is incapable of reproducing. Most shelters will only send out neutered animals for adoption, but if you get your pet another way, neutering should be a top priority after you get it home.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on breeding. If you love animals \u2013 truly love them \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t care what breed your pet it when you choose it. And you should get your pet from an animal shelter. Purchasing an animal from a breeder means another animal in a shelter that you could have adopted will die. You\u2019ll only encouraging what we here at Eluxe to be the unethical practice of breeding dogs and cats. Not sure about that?

Throw environmental health into the mix and wins \u2013 that\u2019s the real cat\u2019s meow!\n\nNow that you know how important it is for your pets not to be exposed to toxic chemicals in their food, flea powder or even on the floor, here are some suggestions to keep your little fur baby \u2013 and the planet \u2013 healthier.\n\nMade with organic wheatgrass, these are a detoxing treat your cat will meow for again and again!

Who knows why\u2026?!\n\nCoconut seems to be having a moment right now, in food, beauty products and now\u2026cat litter! Made from coconut husks, this non-toxic litter is also non-clumping.\n\nThis one is especially important if you have cats. Remember that whatever you wash the floor with eventually ends up on their paws, and ultimately in their bodies when they lick it off.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How to Be A More Eco Friendly Pet Owner", "description": "how to be a more eco friendly pet owner, where to buy green kitty litter, how to be a more ethical pet owner, how to be a sustainable pet mom", "url": "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/articles/eco-friendly-pet/", "site_name": "Eluxe Magazine", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EluxeMagazine?ref=br_rs", "article:published_time": "2022-05-15T17:19:48+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-19T18:06:02+00:00", "image": "https://eluxemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Picture-27.jpg", "image:width": "639", "image:height": "349", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/jody-mccutcheon-4303a6b5/?originalSubdomain=ca", "https://humix.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwomensswim.com%2Fhumix%2Fvideo%2Fa2b1d162c1684cb26c1fdc1102588542699291f1", "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/articles/not-domestic-endangered-sand-cats/", "https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-research-statistics-US-pet-ownership.aspx", "https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-research-statistics-US-pet-ownership.aspx", "http://www.theflushablebag.com", "http://www.poopbags.com", "http://www.petco.com/Shop/ShoppingGuides/petco_ChooseCatLitter_ShoppingGuideID_4_Nav_288.aspx", "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/crystalline-silica", "https://pangopets.com/best-cat-litters/", "https://getyourpet.com/", "https://www.ewg.org/research/polluted-pets/chemical-exposures-and-pets-health", "https://www.ewg.org/research/polluted-pets", "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/articles/is-genuine-leather-actually-chinese-dog-leather/", "https://www.ewg.org/research/polluted-pets", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/9-leading-causes-of-bird-deaths-in-canada-1.1873654", "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/expert-answers-to-your-questions-about-cats/", "https://www.ecology.com/2013/08/27/global-impact-feral-cats/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/magazine/why-pet-stores-suck/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/articles/which-essential-oils-can-hurt-your-pets/", "https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Greens-Treats-Semi-Moist-Treat/dp/B001L4YYYC?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_1", "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Organic+Pet+Bed&ref=nb_sb_noss", "https://chocolatelabradorretriever.ca/silver-lab-puppies-the-411/", "https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Cat-Grass-Seeds-Kit/dp/B08GN33LT2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=BBY2QKRMZACF&keywords=organic%2Bcat%2Bgrass&qid=1652635243&sprefix=organic%2Bcat%2Bgrass%2Caps%2C268&sr=8-3&th=1", "https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Cat-Grass-Seeds-Kit/dp/B08GN33LT2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=BBY2QKRMZACF&keywords=organic%2Bcat%2Bgrass&qid=1652635243&sprefix=organic%2Bcat%2Bgrass%2Caps%2C268&sr=8-3&th=1", "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Biodegradable+Poop+Bags&ref=nb_sb_noss", "https://www.amazon.com/CatSpot-Litter-100-Coconut-Cat/dp/B01M6B9XXJ/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Natural+Kitty+Litter&qid=1561534966&s=gateway&sr=8-5", "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Natural+Kitty+Litter&ref=nb_sb_noss", "https://www.amazon.com/Eco-Me-Natural-Multi-Surface-Cleaner-Herbal/dp/B003B2FYSC", "#abh_about", "#abh_posts", "https://eluxemagazine.com/author/guest/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/author/guest/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/author/guest/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/author/guest/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/culture/articles/nanoparticle-safety-tiny-particles-huge-problem/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/travel/green-skiing-in-morzine/", "https://eluxemagazine.com/fashion/ethical-wedding-guest-outfit-ideas/"], "authors": ["Guest"], "publish_date": "2022-05-15T17:19:48+00:00"}
