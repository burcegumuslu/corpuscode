Somehow these fake news media outlets never want to talk about the elephant in the room which is the Federal Reserve and its more than 100-year reign over the American money supply.\n\nWhile it is true that weather conditions have not necessarily been favorable for large yields in certain commodities, the real problem right now is runaway inflation caused by many decades of fiat money printing. This has created a massive debt bubble that is about to pop.\n\nGlobal banking cartels engineered the current and ongoing destruction of the global economy\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) plandemic was also thrown into the mix as a scapegoat. All of the supply chain issues that are preventing items from getting from their origins to their destinations are another convenient cover for why things are falling apart.\n\nThis writer\u2019s perspective is that things were already going to fall apart and someone needed a distraction. In comes the China virus, fresh out of the labs, to create chaos, send a few more billion Big Pharma\u2019s way via the \u201cvaccines,\u201d and now the final dominoes are falling with the lingering supply chain problems.\n\n\u201cWe are out of everything, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s oil, gas, coal, copper, aluminum: you name it and we\u2019re out of it,\u201d said Goldman Sachs\u2019 Jeff Currie earlier in the month, explaining that the markets are \u201cincredibly tight from a physical perspective.\u201d\n\nFrom a paper perspective, the traders keep on trading. But from a physical perspective, well, the emperor has no clothes and it is becoming painfully obvious like perhaps never before in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nAbdul Hameed, director of sales at Manzoor Trading in Lahore, Pakistan, said the edible oils situation is now in \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d and that prices could continue to climb higher and higher with no end in sight.\n\n\u201cThe global supply and demand situation is a very, very big concern,\u201d he added.\n\nScarily, Tesco Plc chairman John Allan announced that the \u201cworst has yet to come\u201d as far as food shortages and coupled inflation. Lower-income households throughout the West will be especially impacted by this, though truth be told, everyone will due to the sheer magnitude of what is still to come.\n\n\u201cWhat are you complaining about? You can still get a safe and effective vaccine for free,\u201d joked one reader at Zero Hedge morbidly. \u201cThings have never been better!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cCOVID is over now; this is the new thing,\u201d suggested another about the Ukrainian invasion and how it is shifting the narrative to the next phase.\n\n\u201cHow can I worry about food prices and availability when I am trying to figure out if I am a boy or a girl or something else???\u201d joked another about how the current delusional stock of American \u201cwoke\u201d mobsters have a very rude awakening in store for them on the horizon. \u201cPriorities folks!!!\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the global economic collapse can be found at Collapse.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Edible oil prices soar as global food prices approach record highs", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ingredients.news/2022-02-27-edible-oil-food-prices-post-record-highs.html", "site_name": "Ingredients News", "description": "The price of soybeans has reached its highest level since 2008, which is the last time a major market crash happened.
