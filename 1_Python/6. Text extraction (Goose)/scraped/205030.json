For those who wish to receive an additional booster, it would mark their fourth injection since COVID-19 vaccines were first rolled out in December of 2020.\n\nUntil now, the FDA had cleared fourth doses only for people 12 and older who have severely weakened immune systems. The agency said this \u201cespecially fragile group\u201d can also get an additional booster, a fifth shot. The latest expansion authorizes an additional shot for all Americans aged 50 years or older, regardless of health status.\n\nThe announcement was expected after Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said a fourth dose would be \u201cnecessary\u201d due to waning immunity just over two weeks ago. Additionally, Bourla lobbied for an eventual authorization of a second dose for all age groups regardless of health status. \u201cRight now, the protection that you\u2019re getting from the third [dose], it is good enough \u2014 actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 it\u2019s not that good against infections, but doesn\u2019t last very long,\u201d Bourla claimed.\n\nThe Pfizer CEO went on to claim that the Omicron variant is the first variant that was able to \u201cevade\u201d their vaccine. Furthermore, Dr. Anthony Fauci repeatedly claimed that a third booster injection, or a singular COVID-19 booster shot, would offer protection against future variants when the shots were beginning to roll out last December.\n\nFDA chief Dr. Peter Marks urged Americans who have not received a first booster shot to do so \u201cimmediately\u201d, claiming that the jab will offer vital protection. But the second booster is only for these higher-risk groups because \u201ccurrent evidence suggests some waning of protection\u201d for them.\n\nPfizer had asked the FDA to clear a fourth shot for people 65 and older, while Moderna requested another dose for all adults \u201cto provide flexibility\u201d for the government to decide who really needs one, according to the . The FDA set age 50 as the threshold for a second COVID-19 booster shot for both companies. As for the immune-compromised, only the Pfizer vaccine can be used in those as young as 12; Moderna\u2019s is for adults.\n\nThere\u2019s limited evidence to tell how much benefit another booster could offer right now. FDA made the decision without input from its independent panel of experts that has wrestled with how much data is required to expand shots, reports the AP.\n\nBoth pharmaceutical giants, as well as the FDA, are \u201cconcerned\u201d about an Omicron-sibling variant that is leading to increased case rates in Europe. In Austria, the government reinstated its vaccine passport system, as well as its mask mandate, just two weeks after lifting them in response to the new variant.\n\nRELATED: Pfizer Earnings Report Describes Possibility of Unfavorable Safety Data For Vaccine, Risk of \u2018Serious\u2019 Adverse Reactions", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FDA Approves Second COVID-19 Booster Shot for Ages 50 And Up", "description": "The FDA has authorized a second COVID-19 booster shot for older Americans.
