But the current regime is hell-bent on destroying even this advantage we hold over our two primary competitors \u2014 Russia and China \u2014 which have nuclear weapons inventories of their own.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, literally dozens of employees at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons research and development lab in New Mexico face termination after refusing to get a COVID vaccine, and among those at risk of being fired include some of our country\u2019s top nuclear scientists.\n\nThe deadline for all federal workers and federal contractors at the lab to get the vaccine has come and gone and it\u2019s not clear at this point if any of the highly skilled researchers have actually been terminated, but clearly that is a consideration and if we lose those personnel, there isn\u2019t any way to rapidly replace the skill set and the decades of knowledge they collectively obtain.\n\nTo that point, 114 employees filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against the vaccine mandate, which The Hill reported last week, \u201cWorkers at the New Mexico laboratory, which created the atomic bomb, filed a lawsuit claiming that exemptions to the mandate have been denied without proper justification.\u201d\n\nHowever, a state judge has already struck down the suit, KRQE13 reported:\n\nOn Friday, Judge Jason Lidyard denied the request of the 114 employees asking for the vaccine mandate at LANL to be blocked. Jonathan Diener is an attorney representing some of the plaintiffs, who argued to the judge that LANL should be considered a government entity.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s perfectly clear that employment is a benefit that the government is giving these people at LANL and they\u2019re taking it away because they\u2019re exercising their constitutional right to decide what goes in their body,\u201d said Diener.\n\nAccording to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, workers had until Oct. 15 to be vaccinated. \u201cEmployees granted religious exemptions will go on vacation or unpaid leave until pandemic conditions improve. Judge Lidyard said that was an \u2018ok\u2019 religious accommodation,\u201d the local outlet reported.\n\n\u201cThat was not a real accommodation and I\u2019m shocked that the judge accepted that as a legitimate accommodation for those people,\u201d said Diener.\n\nIn a statement, officials from Triad National Security LLC, the federal contractor that runs the lab, said, \u201cTriad values the contributions of all employees, and our decision to mandate the vaccine was made only after considerable thought.\n\n\u201cThe safety and health of our employees remains our top priority as we fulfill our national security mission, and as a result, our vaccine mandate remains in effect. We appreciate the thorough review and consideration provided by the court on the important issues presented at the hearing,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe company said that 96 percent of employees at the lab were vaccinated, but clearly, some of the most important and talented employees \u2014 nuclear scientists \u2014 were not.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs include scientists, nuclear engineers, project managers, research technicians and others who have some of the highest security clearances in the nation for the work they do,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cSome employees have estimated the lab could lose anywhere from 4% to 10% of the workforce because of the mandate,\u201d the newswire service continued.\n\nThis pandemic has been so politicized \u2014 by Democrats seeking to expand and consolidate unconstitutional powers \u2014 it almost has to have been intentional.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vaccine mandate being used to gut America\u2019s weapons research assets by firing top scientists at Los Alamos", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2021-10-24-vaccine-mandate-gut-americas-weapons-research-firing-top-scientists.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "The diabolical nature of the Biden regime puts America and Americans more at risk every day as these lunatics continue to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic to weaken our country in the face of our enemies, such is their hatred for our liberties.
