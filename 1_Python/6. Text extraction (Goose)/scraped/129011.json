At the start of his article, he even references a cartoon photo that was circulated back in early 2020 depicting the Fauci Flu \u201cas a tsunami about to crash upon some country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe past two years have seen a string of record-breaking floods, including the recent inundation of one-third of Pakistan and other disasters bearing climate\u2019s fingerprints,\u201d Opperman writes.\n\nClimate\u2019s fingerprints, eh? But it gets worse. Opperman also claims that concerning covid, there remains \u201cone solid reason for hope\u201d and that is the vaccines, which he says have thus far shown \u201cdurable performance in saving lives, even with variants.\u201d\n\nWith an actual hurricane right now devastating Florida, Opperman\u2019s piece about covid vaccines and climate change is a bit tone deaf, to say the least.\n\nIt is a diatribe of pseudoscientific nonsense and misused analogies that makes both Opperman and The Hill look crazy for even writing and publishing it in the first place.\n\nOpperman laments the fact that there \u201cis no vaccine for climate change,\u201d but success that there is a \u201cpowerful lesson\u201d to be learned from vaccinology \u201cas we try to minimize impacts triggered by an already changing climate.\u201d\n\nHe believes that by \u201cvaccinating\u201d the climate through flood mitigation measures, we can stymie global warming in the same way that covid injections have put an end, in his view, to the plandemic.\n\nIn a way, Opperman is right. Trying to control the climate by \u201cvaccinating\u201d it using the methods he and others are proposing really is the same thing as trying to keep people healthy and alive with chemical injections \u2013 but not in the way he thinks.\n\nOne glaring omission in Opperman\u2019s piece is his failure to address the prolific vaccine damage that is occurring all around the world. Millions upon millions of people are now permanently injured or dead because of the jabs, which do not work as claimed.\n\nSimilarly, trying to block out the sun or eliminate all carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the world threatens to destroy the planet, not save it.\n\nJust like vaccines, climate mitigation measures often cause more harm than good, even as their proponents control the narrative with an iron fist to try to keep the truth from escaping their grip.\n\nLeaving the planet alone instead of trying to reengineer it is the best course of action, just like leaving the immune system alone is better than continually trying to vaccinate it.\n\nIdeologies like those now being pushed by Opperman used to exist primarily within the realm of satire. Unfortunately in today\u2019s world, they are becoming embedded in official government policy, to the detriment of our freedoms and liberties.\n\n\u201cThese things they\u2019ve declared war on like carbon dioxide and sunlight are needed to sustain plant life, which in turn sustains us,\u201d wrote a Natural News commenter about the climate insanity.\n\n\u201cAny 5th grader knows that,\u201d responded another. \u201cOr used to.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about rampant climate lunacy in the corporate-controlled media can be found at Climate.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "World Wildlife Fund scientist offers the worst hurricane advice ever, calling for \u201cvaccine logic\u201d to tame flood waters while ignoring mass vaccine DEATHS", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2022-09-30-wwf-scientist-vaccine-logic-flood-waters-covid.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "The solution to climate change is to adopt \u201cvaccine thinking\u201d for flood management, says Jeff Opperman, the global lead freshwater scientist at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
