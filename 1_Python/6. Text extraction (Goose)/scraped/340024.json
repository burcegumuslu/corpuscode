Elon Musk insists $3 billion Mars rocket could fly again in two months - but experts say it may be over a YEAR because of damage to the launchpad SpaceX is yet to release post-launch photos of the Boca Chica pad, but several have emerged which show the damage done by Starship's 33 first-stage Raptor engines was considerable. Last Thursday's lift off 'left a large crater in the concrete under the launch mount,' Spaceflight Now said in a tweet that included several photos of the debris-strewn pad, adding that the orbital mount was 'heavily damaged'. Max Evans, a photographer for NASASpaceflight.com, also documented some of the damage. 'Tough to imagine this site being usable again in under a 12-month timeline \u2014 would be happy to be proven wrong,' Evans tweeted in a thread.\n\nCharlotte has been left destitute and relying on food banks while Kam's still in shock at losing her husband: The heartbroken families of AstraZeneca Covid vaccine victims who say they've been abandoned by the government Two years have passed since Kam Miller lost her husband Neil \u2014 and the shock at what happened is still audible in her voice. 'Every morning I wake up and I still can't quite believe that he isn't here,' says Kam, 57. 'Sometimes I even wonder if it was just a bad dream, then it hits me \u2014 this really happened.' It was on May 1, 2021, while Kam was sat at the kitchen table of their Leicester home, browsing online for presents for Neil's 51st birthday, that she heard a sickening thud. She ran upstairs to the bathroom where Neil had gone to take a shower \u2014 and the memory of what she saw next won't leave her. 'It was horrible, awful,' says Kam, her voice breaking. 'Neil was on the floor unconscious, making gurgling noises. That image won't go from my head.'\n\nSan Francisco is a postcard from a driverless car future. Heres what its like. When the dense, iconic fog rolled in over the residential neighborhood of Balboa Terrace on a recent Tuesday, five matching white SUVs covered in cameras ground to a halt. Confused by the drop in visibility, the Google-owned electric Jaguar I-PACEs tried to pull over and wait out the weather \u2014 creating a brief traffic jam. But there was no one inside to yell at. The cars were empty autonomous cars run by software. It was just another day in the life of San Franciscans, who have noticed a sudden increase in the empty vehicles roaming the streets over the past few months. Google-owned Waymo and General Motors\u2019 Cruise are some of the companies testing their autonomous technology here, training the cars on how to share the roads with less predictable humans and navigate real world situations. It\u2019s happening in other cities as well, including Phoenix, Austin and parts of Los Angeles, and the companies have plans to expand to more locations in the coming year.\n\nThe Kremlin reported that the parade on May 9 in Moscow will take place The Victory Parade will take place on May 9 on Red Square, but it is premature to say whether there will be an aviation unit.\n\n\n\n This was announced to journalists on Monday by the press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov. \"Preparations are underway for the parade, it will take place,\" the Kremlin spokesman said. In his opinion, \"this will be a very important event, traditional for May 9.\"\n\n\n\n Peskov did not give an answer to the question whether the aviation part of the parade will take place. \"It is still premature to make such announcements, I would not like to do this,\" the Kremlin spokesman explained. \"We will inform you in a timely manner what elements the parade will include,\" he promised, noting that \"it is too early to talk\" about the various elements of the parade.\n\nEU not ready to finalize new Russia sanctions Borrell EU foreign ministers are not ready to agree a new package of anti-Russian sanctions, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told reporters on Monday as he arrived for a meeting in Luxembourg. Asked whether the EU would impose sanctions on Russian nuclear energy, the diplomat replied that the bloc is not in a position to complete a new package of measures. \u201cWe will continue discussions,\u201d Borrell added. The statement comes as the 27-nation bloc compiles its latest round of sanctions against Moscow, having already imposed ten packages since 2014 in response to the crisis in Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, the EU is planning to prohibit the transit of certain goods through Russia in its new round of measures, including technological goods and certain types of vehicles. It is also aiming to close any loopholes being used to evade existing sanctions.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ysiWge30dA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
