The G rules, applied in both Germany and Austria, refer to either being vaccinated for coronavirus, having proof of recovery, or being tested. With the previously wide-spread 3G rule, a negative PCR test was enough to pass safety requirements. The 2G rule, however, does not include testing, with only the former two categories of vaccination and recovery being accepted.\n\nThe 2G coronavirus rule has now become far more common across both Germany and Austria in recent weeks, with the unvaccinated being banned from museums, restaurants, and other such public places; it is unclear whether the recent extension to euthanasia centres suggest further \u201chealthcare\u201d restrictions to anyone not with the vaccine or proof of recovery.\n\nEuthanasia has been legal in Germany since February last year, after the German supreme court declared a ban on it was unconstitutional.\n\nAngela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor, announced the imposition of the recent harsher restrictions following a meeting between her and the 16 heads of the German state governments earlier this month, declaring that the coronavirus pandemic is \u201cdramatically\u201d worsening.\n\nHealthcare Minister Jens Spahn was even more polemic in his assessment of the situation, arguing that \u201cby the end of this winter everyone in Germany will either be vaccinated, recovered or dead,\u201d as he pushed for an increased rollout of the Pfizer jabs to the over one third of Germans who have yet to take the vaccine.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "GERMANY: Those Seeking Euthanasia Must Be Vaccinated Against COVID", "description": "Germans who wish to undergo euthanasia will now be required to be vaccinated for coronavirus or have proof of recovering from it in order to be \"treated.\"", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/germany-those-seeking-euthanasia-must-be-vaccinated-against-covid/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2021-11-27T20:23:17+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Virginia-COVID-19-Vaccines-Children.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["euthanasia", "Coronavirus", "COVID", "Coronavirus Vaccine", "Vaccine", "Germany"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any individual seeking to be euthanized must have had the covid vaccination according to new guidelines issued by Germany's Euthanasia Association. <a href=\"https://t.co/LiChkCvGip\">pic.twitter.com/LiChkCvGip</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Apex World News (@apexworldnews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/apexworldnews/status/1463895016565260299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.sterbehilfe.de/sterbehilfe-nur-noch-fuer-geimpfte-und-genesene/", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.swp.de/panorama/2g-regel-corona-deutschland-wo-bundeslaender-ungeimpft-test-zutritt-nachweis-bw-bayern-sachsen-thueringen-brandenburg-59278231.html", "https://t.co/LiChkCvGip", "https://twitter.com/apexworldnews/status/1463895016565260299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://nationalfile.com/netherlands-to-allow-euthanasia-terminally-ill-children-under-12-years-old/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-covid-restrictions-unvaccinated-germany/", "https://www.politico.eu/article/jens-spahn-germany-biontech-pfizer-covid-19-vaccination/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/coronavirus/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/coronavirus-vaccine/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/euthanasia/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/germany/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine/"], "authors": ["National File News"], "publish_date": "2021-11-27T20:23:17+00:00"}
