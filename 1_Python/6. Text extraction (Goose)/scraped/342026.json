The Biden regime is now experimenting with a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on a \u201cmulti-country experimental\u201d basis. A totalitarian \u201cnew world order\u201d is being normalized; compliance is being financially rewarded.\n\nCovid-19 propaganda and unlawful mandates did not solve infectious disease, respiratory illness, medical error or immunodeficiency. In fact, these problems only worsened over the past two years, as governments instilled mass formation psychosis, suspending civil liberties and the rule of law. But these acts of subjugation and abuse were never intended to improve anything \u2013 not treatments, not the quality of life, nothing. Instead, covid-19 mandates have conditioned populations to accept totalitarian control over their lives. The collective subconscious is now adapted to a world that is less free \u2013 a world that is more submissive to fraudulent powers and false authorities. This is a necessary step to implement a \u201cgreat reset\u201d or a \u201cnew world order.\u201d\n\nWe are on the brink of a new financial world order\n\nPuppet U.S. president Joe Biden recently spoke about the impending \u201cnew world order.\u201d \u201cNow is a time when things are shifting,\u201d Biden told a round table of CEOs at a quarterly meeting on March 21. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a new world order out there, and we\u2019ve got to lead it. And we\u2019ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.\u201d\n\nSo what is this \u201cnew world order\u201d that Biden is talking about? This \u201cnew world order\u201d most likely refers to a \u201cnew financial order.\u201d Biden recently signed an executive order exploring \u201ca U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\u201d The order places \u201curgency on research and development of a potential United States CBDC, should issuance be deemed in the national interest.\u201d The government now warns of upcoming Russian cyber attacks. Will these cyber attacks be a false flag operation to implement this digital currency \u201cin the national interest?\u201d The federal government is currently developing the technological infrastructure to implement the digital dollar and working with the Federal Reserve bank to implement this system in the near future. This effort includes \u201cmulti-country experimentation\u201d to \u201censure U.S. leadership internationally.\u201d America is trying to \u201clead\u201d a \u201cnew world order\u201d that is guided by a centralized, programmable digital currency.\n\nA new system of digital currency control was announced at the World Government Summit\n\nAt the World Government Summit in Abu Dhabi, a World Economic Forum (WEC) insider gave hints at what is to come. Pippa Malmgren is an American economist who advised former President George W. Bush. She advises presidents and prime ministers around the world and lectures on \u201cthe upside of COVID.\u201d Malmgren\u2019s values align with Klaus Schwab and the WEC, because she sees covid-19 as an opportunity for a great reset that prioritizes population control. During an interview at the World Government Summit, Malmgren ambitiously stated that a cashless society is coming.\n\n\u201cWe are on the brink of a dramatic change where we are about to, and I\u2019ll say this boldly, we are about to abandon the traditional system of money and accounting and introduce a new one,\u201d Malmgren said. \u201cAnd the new one; the new accounting is what we call blockchain\u2026 It means digital, it means having an almost perfect record of every single transaction that happens in the economy, which will give us far greater clarity over what\u2019s going on.\u201d This means NO individual privacy and NO body autonomy rights.\n\nA centralized, government-controlled digital currency is coming. This new system of accounting and currency control would forever change the traditional banking system, upending accounting systems and implementing a new system of monetary control and enforcement of social credit scores and behavioral conditioning.\n\nMalmgren admitted the new digital currency \u201craises huge dangers in terms of the balance of power between states and citizens.\u201d Malmgren said people will have no privacy, so we\u2019re going to need a \u201cdigital constitution of human rights.\u201d The currency will be programmable and could readily be tied to a social credit score that monitors and oversees online activity, carbon footprint, vaccine status, religious beliefs and whatever woke ideas are in fashion at any given time. \u201cThe new digital currency will enforce \u201cequitable distribution\u201d of resources, including limits on gun and ammo purchases, food purchases (to regulate the food supply) and gasoline, etc. This digital system of compliance and control will implement a Personal Digital Identity, that will make it hard to buy and sell without it. Vaccine passports, mask mandates, digital certificates of PCR and vaccine compliance are just an appetizer for what is to come.\n\n\u201cWhat I see is superpowers introducing digital currency,\u201d Malmgren said. \u201cThe Chinese were the first. I think the US is on the brink of moving in the same direction. The Europeans have committed to that as well.\u201d She asked, \u201cWill that new system of digital money and digital accounting accommodate the competing needs of the citizens of all these locations so that every human being has a chance to have a better life? That\u2019s the only measure for whether a world order really serves.\u201d\n\nHer words reflect statements made by Klaus Schwab and the WEC: \u201cYou\u2019ll own nothing and be happy.\u201d Under this new system of surveillance and control, no one will will own their own body or property. Their behavior and activity will be controlled by central economic planners who surveil all purchases and dictate what people are allowed to buy and sell and what conditions they must meet in order to do so.", "opengraph": {"title": "World Government Summit: A centralized, digital currency is coming, and there will be no individual privacy or autonomy", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2022-04-04-centralized-digital-currency-coming-no-privacy-autonomy.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "The World Government Summit recently disclosed new details on the creation of a centralized, programmable digital currency.
