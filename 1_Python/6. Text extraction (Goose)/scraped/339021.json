It passed the Senate and has been sent to the House, where it was referred to the Judiciary Committee. We need YOUR voice to help it pass!\n\u2022 Contact your Arkansas State Representative and urge him or her to SUPPORT S.B. 8 today!\n\nYou can look up who represents you at: https://www.arkansashouse.org/about/contact-us\n\nCalls are more effective than emails and only take a few minutes. Below is a Sample Script, and there are additional Talking Points. Use your own words when you call or email \u2013 a personal message is always more effective than a form message!\n\n\u201cHi, my name is ____, and I am a constituent. I am calling to ask Representative ____ to SUPPORT SB 8.\n\nThis bill establishes a criminal offense for pharmaceutical company executives who knowingly conceal evidence, documentation, or information that their vaccine has dangerous effects.\n\nSB 8 is especially important given the fact that pharma executives have a long history of fraud, and they lied about Covid shots, which have now been proven ineffective, and carry a high rate of side effects.\n\nAs of 3/24/23, 2,450,457 injuries and 34,747 deaths were reported in connection with the Covid shots to the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) \u2014 and it is estimated that only 1-10 percent of adverse reactions are ever reported. And yet the manufacturers are shielded from liability for any harm they cause.\n\nI urge Representative _____to SUPPORT S.B. 8, which would protect citizens against pharmaceutical criminal acts.\n\nKeep your call or email short! Pick the 2 or 3 of these talking points \u2013 or none of them \u2014 that are most important to you, and be sure to explain why this issue matters to you personally.\n\u2022 Vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline have paid billions of dollars in criminal penalties and settlements for research fraud, faking drug safety studies, failing to report safety problems, bribery, kickbacks, and false advertising [1,2]. Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in 2009 alone to resolve criminal and civil allegations [3].\n\u2022 Vaccine makers and the healthcare providers who administer them bear zero liability for vaccine injuries and deaths. Vaccine makers have no incentive to make vaccines safe.\n\u2022 Covid shot manufacturers and providers are shielded from liability through the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act. The only option for compensating people injured by COVID-19 vaccines is the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). Only eight percent of all petitioners since 2010 have been awarded compensation through the CICP. No legal or medical expert fees are covered, no pain and suffering is awarded, lost wages are capped at $50,000 per year, and there is no judicial appeal. In other words, the victims will be severely under-compensated while the pharmaceutical companies get rich. https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PREPact/Pages/default.aspx\n\u2022 This bill holds vaccine manufacturer executive officers criminally liable when their acts or omissions cause individuals harm. While the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 prevents vaccine manufacturers from being held liable for civil damages for a person\u2019s death or injury caused by a vaccine, SB 8 only imposes criminal liability to executive officers; therefore, SB 8 should not be preempted by federal law.\n\u2022 Data from 145 of the most vaccinated countries show that Covid shots are associated with a 31 percent increase in deaths.\n\u2022 The mRNA Covid shots include polyethylene glycol (PEG), an immunogenic chemical compound associated with severe allergic reactions that can lead to death.\n\u2022 Some Covid shot batches have been found to contain metallic particles, and all mRNA shots contain dangerous lipid nanoparticles, which can create a series of toxic reactions, including damage to DNA.\n\u2022 Manufacturers originally claimed their Covid shots were 95 percent effective. The Director of the CDC now admits Covid shots do not prevent Covid. https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-05-21/h_d2accec79fdc37f422d02c536828ea1e\n\u2022 There are no long-term studies of Covid-19 shots on the safety, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or effect on reproduction.\n\u2022 There have already been 2,450,457 COVID-19 Vaccine adverse events and 34,747 COVID-19 vaccine deaths reported in the U.S. to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (per data released 3/24/23).\n\u2022 COVID injections were not properly tested and are dangerous, as confirmed by Pfizer\u2019s own documents.\n\nRead these articles for more information on the dangers of Covid shots:\n\nRead this new article on the lack of safety for all vaccines: https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/vaccines-unsafe-since-the-very-beginning/#gsc.tab=0", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Help support a good vaccine bill in Arkansas!", "description": "\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print post Arkansas\u2019 legislators have introduced a good bill that establishes a criminal offense of vaccine harm for pharmaceutical company executive officers when their acts or omissions [\u2026]", "url": "https://www.westonaprice.org/help-support-a-good-vaccine-bill-in-arkansas/", "site_name": "The Weston A.
