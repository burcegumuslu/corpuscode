To Big Pharma, this was unacceptable. So they approached Twitter.\n\nCensorship request: They contacted Nina Morschhaeuser, a former Twitter head of Public Policy based in Germany, to put a stop to it, and she brought their concerns to Twitter headquarters.\n\nThe authorities are warning about \u201cserious consequences\u201d of the action, i.e. posts and a flood of comments \u201cthat may violate tos [Terms of Service]\u201d as well as the \u201ctakeover of user accounts\u201d are to be expected. Especially the personal accounts of the management of the vaccine manufacturers are said to be targeted. Accordingly, fake accounts could also be set up.\n\n \u2014Nina Morschhaeuser\n\u2022 The monitoring and shielding of the corporate accounts of Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca from activists\n\u2022 Monitoring and \u201chiding\u201d tweets and hashtags referring to the \u201cPeople\u2019s vaccine\u201d and joining the -19 Technology Access Pool\n\u2022 An open communication channel with recommendations of accounts to suspend from Twitter\n\nThe files don\u2019t show whether Twitter fully complied with these specific requests, but it is clear that several real accounts were suspended, not only for asking for the sharing of vaccine patents but for questioning the impending implementation of vaccine passports.\n\nBig profit: At the core of the matter though wasn\u2019t the campaign\u2019s desire for a shared vaccine. The main problem was the request for transparency. Making the vaccine patents public would have exposed all the cut corners contributing to the dangerous makeup of the vaccine. It would have exposed that the vaccines amounted to a patchwork, high school science experiment.\n\nSuch exposure would have jeopardized the record profits Big Pharma could make from these vaccines. And that was unacceptable.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/26838-big-pharma-pressured-twitter-into-shaping-vaccine-dialogue", "site_name": "theTrumpet.com", "title": "World News, Economics and Analysis Based on Bible Prophecy", "image": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/trumpet-icon.png", "description": "theTrumpet.com delivers in-depth news analysis on top stories, world news, weather, economics and society in the light of Bible prophecy.", "type": "website"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://theintercept.com/2023/01/16/twitter-covid-vaccine-pharma/", "https://www.thetrumpet.com/trumpet_issues/244"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
