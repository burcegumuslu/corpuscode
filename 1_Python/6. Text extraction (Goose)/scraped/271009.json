As we read in a report from France 24:\n\nChina\u2019s Sina Weibo on Monday reversed a decision to remove gay content after outcry among gay Chinese who say the company had smeared homosexuality by lumping it with pornography as it tried to meet government censorship directives. China\u2018s Twitter-equivalent Weibo said on Friday it would remove pornographic, violent or gay videos and cartoons in a three-month campaign, singling out a genre of manga animations and comics that often depict raunchy gay male relationships. In response, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) advocates poured online to criticise the decision using hashtags, open letters and even calls to dump Sina shares. On Monday, Sina said the clean-up would no longer target gay content. The outcry reflects a fear that growing censorship tends to ban all gay content as \u201cdirty\u201d, a setback for efforts to carve out an online space of tolerance for homosexuality in China\u2019s traditionally Confucian society, LGBT advocates say. It was unclear whether Sina\u2019s measure was a direct result of a censorship directive from the government or an initiative taken by the company itself. Sina did not respond to a request for comment. The official People\u2019s Daily newspaper of the ruling Communist Party on Sunday encouraged tolerance towards gay people, but added that \u201cvulgar\u201d content must be removed regardless of sexual orientation. Chinese LGBT advocates hope to promote gay rights by educating society about sexual preferences and pushing back against traditional pressures to marry and have children.\n\nI call these \u201cactivists\u201d terrorists because that is what they are, terrorizing humanity by pushing people to acquiesce their satanic ways. Who is backing the sodomite movement in China? One major entity for the sodomite movement is the China Development Brief. Looking at their website, one can see many pro-sodomite posts:\n\nThe China Development Brief vocally backs and advertises for the Beijing LGBT Center, the very organization that pushed for the Chinese social media platform to end its ban on sodomite imagery and propaganda.\n\nLooking at the China Development Brief\u2019s partners, one will find some very powerful entities and groups:\n\nWhat this shows is that the elites are pushing for the kingdom of Sodom. A revealing thing is that Rockefeller is behind. The Rockefeller has been and is one of the biggest pushers of eugenics of the world. David Rockefeller was a major funder for eugenics.\n\nDavid Rockefeller was a big supporter for the Population Council, an organization that advocates for population control through contraception and abortion. The Population Council was founded by John D. Rockefeller III, and it was financed by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The first president for the Population Council was one Frederick Henry Osborn who, according to the New York Times, \u201cmade a fortune in railroads and investment banking, retired from business at the age of 40 and turned to eugenics and demography, writing extensively on heredity, the environment and population problems.\u201d\n\nThe same report says that \u201cMr. Osborn and John D. Rockefeller 3d began the Population Council to foster studies and education on the people of various nations in relation to their material and cultural resources. He was a director of the Population Association of America and the American Eugenics Society.\u201d Osborn was amongst the earliest Americans to advocate for eugenics, as part of America\u2019s inundation of eugenic ideology into Europe. It was in the United Stated where the first sterilization law was passed, in Indiana in 1907. From then on, sterilization laws began to be passed in other states, and by 1928 \u2014 just when Europe\u2019s first sterilization law was passed in Switzerland \u2014 thirty American states passed their own sterilization laws.\n\nWhen Germany took American eugenics and began to impose it in its fullest Darwinist way, Osborn and his ilk were in glee. Osborn said: \u201cGermany\u2019s rapidity of change with respect eugenics was possible only under a dictator.\u201d\n\nAmerican eugenists saw in Germany\u2019s eugenist policies what they truly wanted to carry out in the US. Osborn was disappointed that, while the US was responsible in teaching the Germans eugenics, it itself did not follow through to accomplish the Darwinist plan. Osborn said:\n\nOsborn also remarked: \u201crecent developments in Germany constitute perhaps the most important social experiment which has ever been tried.\u201d\n\nAfter the Second World War, when the eugenic language of calling people \u2018inferior\u2019 became more taboo, Osborn was instrumental in changing the face of the eugenist movement to make it appear more compassionate. During this \u2018reformation\u2019 from 1946 to 1956, Osborn was president of the Pioneer Fund, a secretive White supremacist group. In 1956, Osborn travelled to England to give a speech for the annual Galton Lecture at a meeting for the Eugenics Society, to tell his fellow eugenists on the manner by which to advance their social-Darwinist cause:\n\nWhen Roe V. Wade was passed in 1972, Osborn praised the legalization of abortion as part of the new face of the eugenist movement, saying:\n\nThe sodomite agenda and the eugenics agenda are one in the same.\n\nAnother conduit for Sodom is the \u201cCounterjihad\u201d movement. The Counterjihad uses the threat of Islam as a way to promote homosexuality by saying, essentially, \u2018That anti-Sharia means being pro-LGBT.\u2019\n\nRobert Spencer wrote an article for PJ Media, openly promoting homosexual pornographic material. Of course, the article is guised as being \u201cCounterjihad,\u201d while at the same time pushing for perverted and degenerate homosexual writing. The article is entitled, \u201cWhen a Gay Playwright Discovers Islamic Jihad,\u201d and its actually a review for a homosexual novel written by sodomite activist Bruce Bawer, who was actually one of the major devisers of the sodomite marriage movement.\n\nSpencer describes the author and the book as such: \u201cBruce Bawer is to be commended for his honesty and courage in writing this superb novel.\u201d Robert Spencer expresses his own anti-Christian hatred in this line of his perverted article:\n\nAn anti-Christian book is described by Spencer, a supposed Catholic, as \u201can eloquent, impassioned rebuke\u201d to \u201cjudgmental fundamentalism\u201d. A Christian would never describe a sodomite book with such words. Spencer then writes of the book\u2019s \u201cmany other passages\u201d as having \u201cfull awareness of the jihadi belief system and mindset,\u201d since it is about a sodomite named Steve who, while partaking in vile acts, learns the truth about the jihadist threat. Spencer, who obviously read the sodomite book, writes: \u201cOne of Steve\u2019s numerous harrowing encounters takes place when his search for one of the jihad plotters leads him to a gay sauna in Munich.\u201d\n\nSodomite saunas? Really Robert? This is perversity. Such reprobate drivel fits right into the deranged ways of the Counterjihad movement, which is nothing but a propaganda machine to spread perversity and genocidal ideology. It is obvious that Spencer read this book, and its obvious that it is perverted. Spencer is now in the business of promoting homosexual pornographic literature. Here is just one part of the book, just to show you what perversion Spencer is promoting, and how degenerate and depraved Robert Spencer really is:\n\nIn Robert Spencer\u2019s article he writes of how the novel has a plot in which Muslim terrorists want to kill \u201cgay anti-Islam politician\u201d. And in this disgusting book, it speaks of this politician sodomizing men, and this horrific promotion of degeneracy and utter vile sickness worthy of death, is being advocated by Robert Spencer. Here is a photo of the book\u2019s pederastic sickness:\n\nThis evil sickness looks like it came straight from some medieval homosexual Islamic text.\n\nOn Robert Spencer\u2019s website it reads that the sodomite novel \u201cwill open eyes.\u201d Really? These posts have opened our eyes to the reality that Robert Spencer is a son of Sodom. In our last article on the Counterjihad movement, we showed that Robert Spencer travelled to Iceland to speak for a neo-pagan and neo-Nazi cult called Vakur, which is led by Sigurfreyr Jonasson, an occultist and neo-Nazi who promotes occult homosexuality. This article that Spencer wrote marketing for homosexual pornography further shows that Spencer is indeed a pervert son of Sodom, worthy of death in the hegemony of the Holy Inquisition.\n\nSpencer is both normalizing homosexuality by portraying sodomites as victims, and explicitly promoting this evil by marketing for this demonic book which belongs in a heaping fire. The acolytes of antichrist are obsessed with \u201cfree speech\u201d; they bow down before the altar of \u201cfree speech\u201d; their creed is \u201cfree speech.\u201d Its all the freedom to do evil, to be a degenerate, a vile and wicked agent for the demons and all their wiles, all done in the name of \u201cfighting Islam.\u201d\n\nNumerous times has Robert Spencer promoted the citizens of Sodom. Recently he praised Milo Yiannopoulos, a homosexual eugenist who promotes pedophilia. Spencer recently did a vide promoting an event led by Pamela Geller in which Milo spoke. Spencer said of the pedophile:\n\nSpencer will go on and on about how Muhammad had sex with a nine year old, but he has no repulsion in promoting an utter degenerate like Milo, describing him as a \u201cgreat\u201d speaker. And that wretch of a witch, Pamela Geller, smiling with that degenerate smile, working with a pedophile, what a disgusting woman she is. That Pamela Geller, as I said before, is a wretch who, if we were in a Christian state, would rightly be cast into the flames of justice. Read the words of Milo himself, and then realize what perversity these perfidious agents are promoting. Here are his own words:\n\nSpencer talks about Islamic deviancy, but he has no issue in promoting sodomite degeneracy? Lets not forget that Milo also has said that sodomites genetically inherit a higher intelligence than normal people, writing that \u201cgay men are smarter: we test higher for IQ than our heterosexual counterparts. Intelligence allows us to \u201ctranscend\u201d our evolutionary programming, according to evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa, which may explain the correlation between homosexuality and high IQ.\u201d\n\nNotice that Milo references Kanazawa, a eugenist who promotes that sodomites have superior genes. I wrote an entire investigative article on how sodomites view themselves as superior to people who aren\u2019t perverts, which you can read by clicking here.\n\nSpencer talks about Islamic supremacy, but never about sodomite supremacist ideology. Oh, look what I have here, a photo of Robert Spencer with sodomite Douglas Murray:\n\nDouglas once boasted about how he argued for \u201cthe conservative case for gay marriage,\u201d he also goes against, as he writes, \u201cthe opinions of certain homophobes who claim that gays are dangerous precisely because they are somehow going to \u2018gay up\u2019 wider society.\u201d Douglas also chided Christians in Africa, saying that they have \u201ca backward attitude towards homosexuality\u201d. Thats right. If you do not accept homosexuality, think its evil and perverted, then you are \u201cbackwards,\u201d according to the social darwinists of the \u201ccounter jihad movement.\u201d And Robert Spencer, even though he claims to be Catholic, has no problem working and associating himself with such a degenerate nazi.\n\nI reject this insidious push for \u201cfree speech\u201d as nothing but the same call of Satan when he pushed for the license to overthrow God. As the demons were thrown into hell, so shall this heaping piece of garbage called \u201cfree speech\u201d be cast into the flames and burned to the jovial laughs of the saints. Spencer is worthy of death for what he is doing. Let us look into the true Catholic position on what should be done to evil books.\n\nThe books of heretics, or any books that promote hatred against God, or any maliciousness against the true Faith, should not be allowed to be freely published and distributed, but burned and abolished. St. Robert wrote that the books of heretics \u201care rightly forbidden and burned.\u201d Such a measure would be in accordance with the Church, since even before the establishment of Christendom, the Apostles had the earliest Christians burn their pagan books. As St. Luke recorded:\n\n\u201cAlso, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver. So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.\u201d (Acts 19:19)\n\nNotice how by burning the books \u201cthe word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.\u201d This shows that Christianity thrives where evil teachings are uprooted, refuting the common belief amongst many Christians that \u201cwhat is outlawed will only grow stronger.\u201d\n\nThis story of book burning has both a collective and governmental application, that is, both Christian societies and Christian governments have the authority to burn demonic literature. If a small society of Christians could burn down their own pagan books, then an entire Christian empire, under the Church and a Christian state, has the authority to prohibit the diabolical books.\n\nNow, this is not to say that the books of pagans and heretics should never be read, because it is always necessary to understand the nature of evil, and so this is why the Church has always had very erudite thinkers and theologians who, reading such books, were able to combat the false and evil beliefs. We read in a letter written by Dionysus, bishop of Alexandria in the mid third century, that he received a vision in which he heard a voice that declared, \u201cRead all that thou takest in hand, for thou art qualified to correct and prove all, and this very thing has been the cause of thy faith in Christ from the beginning.\u201d (Euseb. Eccles. Hist. 7.7) There is nothing wrong in reading perfidious books for the sake of exposing them, but the majority of people, when perusing such books, do not do so for the sake of combating them, but of curiosity, and strong interest in darkness. This is where the problem lies, and thus this is why the distribution of such must be very limited, never being allowed to freely flood the laity, and only being read for the reason of exposing it, and thus, educating the people on its evils and dangers. Evil should be exposed only to be condemned, rejected, cast away and destroyed, never glorified.\n\nConstantine decreed \u201cthat if any one shall be detected in concealing a book compiled by Arius, and shall not instantly bring it foreword and burn it, the penalty for this offense shall be death; for immediately after the conviction the criminal shall suffer capital punishment.\u201d (The Emperor\u2019s Letter, in Socrates, 1.9)\n\nTell me, where are the books written by Arius today? They don\u2019t exist on account of such laws. The influence of Arianism continued through Muhammad by word of mouth, and if Islam was stopped by such laws, there would be no Islamic problem to deal with today. The same can be for Mormonism and the rest of the insidious cults that exist today.\n\nIn the fourth century there was a dualist cult led by one Priscillian, who read and promoted the gnostic gospels, such as the Gospel of Thomas and Gospel of Andrew. These were false gospels that taught all sorts of gnostic doctrines, and St. Pope Leo the Great declared that such books were to be not only prohibited but burned:\n\nAfter the Council of Ephesus, the books of Nestorius were ordered by the Emperor Theodosius to be set to the flames. The same emperor also decreed that astrologers were obligated by law to burn their books in front of the bishops if they contained anything against the Catholic Faith. (Bellarmine, On Laymen or Secular People, ch. 20, ed. Tutino, p. 93) After the Council of Chalcedon, all the books written by the heretic Eutychius were condemned and a law made by the emperors Valentinian and Macian prohibited anyone from reading or owning any copies. Not only that, but the books were ordered to be assiduously searched and burned. (Bellarmine, On Laymen or Secular People, ch. 20, ed. Tutino, p. 93)\n\nThe Byzantine Emperor Tiberius ordered one of the books of Eutychius to be set to the flames, and when the heretic Athimus was condemned for his Eutychian sympathies, the emperor Justinian established that anyone caught in the act of possessing or transcribing his books would suffer \u201camputation of the hands\u201d. (Bellarmine, On Laymen or Secular People, ch. 20, p. 94)\n\nIn the Seventh Ecumenical Council, held in Nicaea in 787, the books of the iconoclast heretics were ordered to be confiscated and kept from anyone reading them, even clergy:\n\nOf course most people today would object to the burning of anti-Christian books, but such a policy is very effective. Ask yourself a simple question, how many books of the ancient heretics, be it from Arius, Marcion, Valentinus, Eunomius, Nestorius, or Pelagius, still thrive today? The answer is almost none of their books are existent today, (See Bellarmine, On Laymen or Secular People, ch. 20, ed. Tutino, p. 95) except for a few fragments here and there that have survived through Christian apologists quoting them to refute them. Yet, the books of Mormons, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Christian Scientists, atheists and other nefarious groups, are not only existent today, but are vibrantly distributed, and have even become quite popular. The typical notion that Christians need to just refute such books, has proven to be quite ineffective by the severe inundation of such demonic books. Simply refuting the books is not enough; they need to be utterly uprooted.\n\nBooks are more dangerous than speeches; they contain all of the arguments of the heretics in a coherent form, and not only that, they preserve the dangerous beliefs, so that they can last for generations; they can be copied, and distributed to countless people. The dangers of perfidious books was articulated by St. Robert when he said:\n\n\u201cFor an argument put in writing is better prepared and more artful than that which is used in speech. Afterward it is always at one\u2019s disposal, for while discussions and conversations are rare and the words uttered orally soon disappear, the words in books remain forever and are always with us, walk with us, and dwell with us at home. Moreover, books are spread more widely, and anybody can speak with almost the entire world at once through a book. Books invade the homes and offices of many people whom the author of the book never saw and to whom he would hardly ever be introduced.\u201d (Bellarmine, On Laymen or Secular People, ch. 20, ed. Tutino, p. 96)\n\nThe Koran, alongside all other anti-Christian texts, must be banned and outlawed; the books must be burned and never allowed to have influence in society.\n\nThe earth is filled with darkness, and it is only growing blacker.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Homosexual terrorists pressure Chinese social media platform to allow homosexual propaganda and pornography - Walid Shoebat", "description": "By Theodore Shoebat Homosexual activists in China have succeeded in pressuring a Chinese social media platform to allow homosexual propaganda and pornography.
