Nearly everyone in Switzerland has been vaccinated and/or contracted and recovered from COVID-19. Their immune system has therefore been exposed to the coronavirus. In spring/summer 2023, the virus will likely circulate less. The current virus variants also cause rather mild illness. For autumn 2023, the vaccination recommendation will be evaluated again and adjusted accordingly \n\n \n\n \n\n What applies to people at especially high risk? \n\n \n\n In principle, it is also not currently recommended for people at especially high risk to receive a COVID-19 vaccination . They can, however, receive a vaccination following an individual consultation with their doctor. Vaccination may be wise in individual cases, as it improves protection against developing severe COVID-19 for several months. This applies regardless of the number of vaccinations you have already received. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n More news on this topic \n\n \n\n wlos.com... \n\n \n\n Switzerland not recommending COVID vaccines, even for high risk individuals, during spring and summer \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSwitzerland's decision to rescind its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations follows other European countries that have severely loosened their recommendations since the COVID-19 vaccine was released. \n\n \n\n Earlier this year, France stopped recommending COVID-19 vaccines for the general public, which came almost a full year after it lifted the requirement that foreign tourists be vaccinated. Denmark halted its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations all the way back in 2022. \n\n \n\n \n\n There are several questions that can be asked but not in relation to what Switzerland decided to do. For example, was it always the case that children, teenagers, and young and healthy adults, didn't really need any of these Covid vaccines, especially when a large number were already exposed to the virus and developed robust and superior natural immunity. From the moment the first cases of the virus were detected to the moment the first young adults received the vaccines, at least 16 months passed. \n\n \n\n Recommending untested, experimental, and potential hazardous products to young and healthy populations, including children, is at least criminal and medical negligence, and given the number of severe adverse reactions and deaths among young and healthy people due to these products, maybe the greatest medical scandal in history as a number of medical doctors and scientists have said. \n\n \n\n I will emphasize the part where the Swiss Medical Authorities discuss about those who have already been infected and recovered from Covid-19 and I will add to this the very large amount of those who were asymptomatic. When you are infected and deal with the virus then the show for the virus is over. Why previously there were many recommendations to get vaccinated regardless of age group and Covid status?? It seems irrational at the very least. \n\n \n\n This seems irrational, only if you don't understand the mathematics of pandemic growth. \n\n \n\n The mathematical parameter that determines the severity of an epidemic is the basic reproduction number, R. R is the average number of people that an infected person will infect. If R is exactly 1, then every infected person will infect exactly one other person, on the average. In that case, the epidemic will neither grow nor shrink. For every person that gets infected and adds to the population of infected, another person will either recover or die and subtract from the population of infected. If R is greater than one, the population of infected will grow larger over time and if R is less than one, the population of infected will shrink over time. One of the main factors that determines how big R is is the percentage of the population that has specific antibodies to the virus in question. \n\n \n\n 3 years ago at this time, when the virus was just getting started, much less that 1% of the population had been infected and recovered or died. That means that practically everyone that an infected person would meet had no specific immunity to Covid and the probability of an infected person transmitting the virus to someone else would be very high. In the first half of 2020 in Northern Europe, R had an average value of about 4.22: \n\n \n\n www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... \n\n \n\n That's why we saw very rapid growth of the case numbers at that time. \n\n \n\n In early 2021, when the vaccines were first introduced, only about 7% of the population in the US had developed natural immunity from having recovered from infection, so R was still a large positive number, which is why vaccination could make a lot of difference at that time. By the end of 2021, about 10 times as much of the population (75%) had gained some level of immunity from vaccination: \n\n \n\n Now fast forward to today. About 97% of the Swiss population has some level of immunity from either infection, vaccine, or both. The current best estimate of R for Switzerland is 0.38 and a year ago it was 1.38: \n\n \n\n www.theglobaleconomy.com... \n\n \n\n In other words, a year ago the population of infected was still growing rapidly but now it is shrinking rapidly. Furthermore, there is not much more herd immunity to be gained in the population by either vaccination or infection. \n\n \n\n Specific individuals who might be immunocompromised due to cancer treatment, etc. might be at higher risk and want to continue vaccination, but that's on a case-by-case basis. In other words, Covid has gone from a public health issue to a private health issue. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The usual word salad \ud83d\ude06 \n\n \n\n Bla bla bla and the usual vaccine apologetics. \n\n \n\n The last few days we had even more vaccine apologetics and complete denialism of reality in relation to the Astrazeneca vaccine. \n\n \n\n Withdrawn from most countries that have used it \n\n Seriously Injured and killed many people \n\n Legal action has been taken by a group of people against Astrazeneca \n\n \n\n A failed vaccine!
