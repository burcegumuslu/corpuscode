A 17-year-old Hispanic female presented with a one-week history of photopsia and blurred vision in her left eye following the simultaneous administration of the human papillomavirus and meningococcal (conjugate) vaccines. Upon a comprehensive examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/100\u00a0in the left eye. A left fundus examination revealed multiple white dots in the macula and nasal periphery, consistent with a diagnosis of MEWDS. Ancillary testing, including fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and optical coherence tomography, supported the diagnosis. One month following her initial diagnosis, the patient's symptoms had resolved without any therapy, and a fundus examination revealed multiple relatively ill-defined brown-colored subretinal lesions in the nasal midperiphery, corresponding to the location of the previous MEWDS lesions. Subsequently, she received the second dose of the HPV vaccine and then developed a mild COVID-19 infection. Four months after the initial presentation, she received the first dose of the BNT162b2\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine, followed by the second dose a month later. Eight months following her initial presentation, she presented with photopsia in the right eye. Her visual acuity remained 20/20 in the right eye and improved to 20/20 in the left eye, and white dots were identified nasal to the disk and surrounding the peripapillary region; the contralateral MEWDS diagnosis was confirmed by the previously mentioned ancillary tests. At her one-month follow-up, she presented new onset photopsia of the right eye. Her visual acuity remained 20/20 in both eyes, and a fundus examination revealed white lesions suggestive of active MEWDS temporal to the macula and brown-colored spots nasal to the disk, suggestive of recovering MEWDS, nasally. The aforementioned testing confirmed the coexistence of new and resolving lesions; nonetheless, the patient's symptoms resolved without any therapy, and she received the third dose of the BNT162b2\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine 11 months after her initial presentation. Our case suggests that vaccines may serve as immunological triggers of MEWDS. Recurrent MEWDS may occur when an individual is exposed to a powerful immune challenge, such as receiving a wide array of vaccinations in a short period of time. We believe this case constitutes a previously undescribed finding of multiple relatively ill-defined brown-colored subretinal lesions present in late MEWDS.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/126935", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "Contralateral Recurrences of Post-vaccination Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
