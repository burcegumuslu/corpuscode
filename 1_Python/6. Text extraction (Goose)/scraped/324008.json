Or would you make every effort for that money continue rolling in?\n\nTake cancer, for example. Don\u2019t let all the media hype about \u201cThe Cure\u201d fool you. No one who is in a position to do so wants to end cancer because they are all making a killing on the big business of treatment, while ordinary people go broke, suffer horribly, and die.\n\nThere will never be a \u201ccure\u201d brought to market because there just isn\u2019t enough profit in eradicating the disease entirely. There will never be a governing body that protects consumers from being subjected to known carcinogens, because that, too, will stop the cash from rolling in. A great deal of research is covered up and many potential cures are ignored and discredited because there is far more money in perpetuating illness than in curing it. In 2012, the reported spending on cancer treatment was 124.6 billion dollars. Blood money.\n\nJust the word \u201ccancer\u201d sends a frisson of fear down the spine of the most stalwart optimist. Terrifyingly, almost one in two people will get the dreaded disease, and the numbers are only getting worse. Here are some quick stats for background:\n\u2022 Nearly half of all Americans will develop cancer in their lifetime. (source) Quick math tells us that is an astonishing 157 million victims.\n\u2022 Over half a million people in America died of cancer in 2012. (source)\n\u2022 In 2011, cancer was the #1 cause of death in the Western world, and #2 in developing countries. (source)\n\u2022 Cancer is the #1 cause of childhood death in the United States. (source)\n\nThis is a fairly recent increase. A hundred years ago, the number was far different. At that time, 1 in 33 people was stricken with the disease. And despite billions of dollars being spent to find \u201cthe cure\u201d, the World Health Organization predicts that deaths from cancer will DOUBLE by the year 2030.\n\nIt\u2019s being normalized. The news is full of photos of babies who are missing an eye, of beautiful bald children who have lost their hair to chemo, and of people who have had to have body parts removed in order to survive a few more years. But cancer is NOT normal. It isn\u2019t something that \u201cjust happens.\u201d Researchers know the things that cause cancer. Government protection agencies do, too, but they do nothing to limit these toxins in the marketplace.\n\nBecause, cancer is big business and those who are profiting have great financial interest in seeing the deadly trend continue to increase.\n\nSo what has changed? How did we go from a 3% chance of contracting cancer to a 41% chance?\n\nIt\u2019s the advent of Big Pharma, Big Agri and Big Business. They are getting rich off of poisoning Americans through the manufacture of toxic elements that we are exposed to on a daily basis.\n\nUnless you live in a bubble and have no contact with manufactured items, outside air, or the sun, you are exposed to a staggering number of known and suspected carcinogens every day. (Check out THIS LIST to see the known and suspected carcinogens that are readily available in the United States.)\n\nThe statistics support that the cumulative build up of all these different toxins in the human body eventually results in cancer in many people.\n\nFirst, the manufacturers and the \u201cfood\u201d producers profit when we buy their poisoned goods.\n\nThen the medical system and pharmaceutical companies profit when we become ill and must fight cancer.\n\nThe drugs alone can cost over $100,000 per year, and that is on top of exorbitant costs for radiation, chemotherapy, and physicians\u2019 bills. In the United States, cancer is the #1 most expensive \u201cper person\u201d illness to treat. (source)\n\nWhy would those who profit want to prevent cancer when 95.5 BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR is spent on treating it? There is a vested interest in this increase in illness and the people benefiting from it have no intention of reducing the cases of cancer.\n\nDon\u2019t look to Obamacare to be the saving grace of cancer victims, either. With this type of government-controlled medicine, budgets will be strictly adhered to and the decisions on how to proceed and what will be paid for will NOT be in the hands of the ill person. Treatments, medications, and funds will be strictly allocated through what many people are referring to as \u201cdeath panels.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Obamacare only covers 60% of your medical costs in most cases (after a hefty deductible) and none of your medication is covered. If you don\u2019t have $50,000 or more kicking around for your co-pay, you will be out of luck, despite diligently paying your worthless monthly premiums.\n\nAvoiding carcinogens as diligently as possible is your best defense against becoming the \u201c1 in 3\u201d, but it isn\u2019t easy. Furthermore, you\u2019ll be considered an \u201cextremist\u201d or a \u201ckook\u201d by those around you who have buried their heads in the sand.\n\nSince most of us don\u2019t live in a bubble, we will be subjected to some of these toxins \u2013 they\u2019re impossible to avoid entirely. However, you can limit your exposure by taking the following steps to reduce your exposure to everyday poisons. (This list is expanded from the article, \u201cThe Great American Cancer Cluster\u201d with permission from The Daily Sheeple.)\n\u2022 Purchase organic foods as often as possible. GMOs and pesticides are proven carcinogens.\n\u2022 Load your plate with colorful antioxidants. Opt for organic versions of foods like berries, colorful veggies, dark chocolate, and coffee, to name a few, are loaded with powerful, cancer-fighting antioxidants and will boost your immune system against other types of illness and disease as well.\n\u2022 Avoid processed foods. Many of the additives and preservatives featured abundantly in North America are banned in other countries precisely because of the health risks they represent.\n\u2022 Select non-toxic cookware. Nonstick cookware contains Teflon and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which emit at least toxic gases within 5 minutes of heating up that nonstick pan. Once the pans become scratched, toxic particles are leached directly into the food you\u2019re preparing. Aluminum cookware is also potentially toxic. Cast iron, ceramic, glass, and clay are all better cookware options.\n\u2022 Limit the use of plastic in your home. BPA or Bisphenol-A are petrochemical plastics that are a major component of many water bottles, lines the inside of canned goods, and makes up the hard material of many reusable food containers, including some brands of baby bottles. They leach cancer causing endocrine disruptors into food, especially if the food is hot. Use glass containers whenever possible.\n\u2022 Select personal care products that do not contain petrochemicals. Many cosmetics and other health and beauty aids contain petrochemicals. The danger of this is their byproduct, 1,4-dioxane, a proven carcinogen. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies dioxane as a probable human carcinogen California state law has classified dioxane to cause cancer. Animal studies in rats suggest that the greatest health risk is associated with inhalation of vapors. Avoid the following ingredients:\n\u2022 Opt for natural, biodegradable food grade cleaning products. According to the website Natural Pure Organics, the average household contains up to 25 gallons of toxic materials, most of which are in cleaning products. When you use these cleaners, they linger in the air and on the surfaces, increasing your exposure to carcinogens as you inhale the toxins into your lungs or absorb them through your skin.\n\u2022 Avoid artificial sweeteners. Aspartame, for example, is a known carcinogen that breaks down into formaldehyde in the human body.\n\u2022 Refuse vaccines. Many vaccines contain formaldehyde and mercury, both of which are known carcinogens. By the age of two, if a child has received all of the recommended vaccines, he or she has received 2,370 times the \u201callowable safe limit\u201d for mercury (if there is such a thing as a safe level of poison). The HPV vaccine can actually increase the risk of reproductive cancer. The polio vaccine most recently came under fire for its cancer-causing ingredients. (Learn more about the cancer causing ingredients in vaccines HERE.)\n\u2022 Avoid tap water. If you have municipal water, drink it at the risk of ingesting loads of toxins. First, there is the willful addition of sodium fluoride, a pesticide which is labeled as \u201cdeadly to humans.\u201d Not only has the consumption of fluoride been linked to cancer, but it also lowers IQs, causes infertility, and causes hardening of the arteries. Then there is the addition of chlorine, which is used to kill bacteria that could make us sick. Unfortunately, according to Dr. Michael J. Plewa, a genetic toxicology expert at the University of Illinois, chlorinated water is carcinogenic. \u201cIndividuals who consume chlorinated drinking water have an elevated risk of cancer of the bladder, stomach, pancreas, kidney and rectum as well as Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\u201d\n\u2022 Maintain a healthy body weight. Obesity has been linked to increased risks of cancers of the esophagus, breast, endometrium, uterus, colon and rectum, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, and gallbladder.\n\nThe mindboggling thing is that those who strictly avoiding carcinogens and toxins are labeled \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201chysterical\u201d. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have watched people roll their eyes or scoff when I refuse to partake in things that are hazardous. Somehow, drinking water from my own BPA-free water bottle is considered to be \u201cextreme\u201d. Not taking my children to McDonald\u2019s or feeding them hot-dogs and Doritos is \u201cmean\u201d. Making our body care products and cleaning products from wholesome, non-toxic ingredients is \u201csilly\u201d.\n\nI believe that knowingly ingesting toxic ingredients is \u201ccrazy\u201d. I believe that rubbing carcinogens on my body or spraying them around my house is \u201cridiculous\u201d. I think that having poison injected into my defenseless children or feeding it to them on a colorful plate is \u201cmean\u201d.\n\nNever forget that the bottom line is profit. Don\u2019t expect the FDA or the EPA to step in. They\u2019ve proven time and again that their purpose is to serve the interests of Big Business, not the consumers.\n\nCancer represents big money to the pharmaceutical companies and the health industry. They do NOT have a vested interest in prevention. So, maybe, just maybe, subjecting your body to the tender mercies of Big Pharma and the AMA and lining their already loaded pockets is just a little bit sillier than taking steps to avoid illness altogether.\n\nThis article is dedicated to some beloved people in my life, one of whom fought it and won and the other who is fighting the good fight and will not go quietly\u2026 much love to SD and JS, and all who are touched by this icy finger.\n\nDaisy Luther is a freelance writer and editor.
