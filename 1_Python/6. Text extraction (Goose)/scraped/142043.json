Could the truth about vaccines be going mainstream?\n\nLet's face it: the only real justification for using vaccines to \"immunize\" ourselves against disease is derived from the natural fact that when challenged by infectious agents the humoral arm of our immune system launches a successful response capable of conferring lasting immunity. Were it not for the elegance, proficiency, and mostly asymptomatic success of our recombinatorial immune system in dealing so well with infectious challenges, vaccination would have no scientific...\n\nDr. Judy Mikovits Joins GreenMedInfo Advisory Board \u2013 Welcome to the Revolution! GreenMedInfo is honored to welcome Dr. Judy Mikovits to the team as she continues her search for absolute truth within the scientific community. As a true scientist, Dr. Mikovits believes it is her duty to seek truth at any cost, and we gladly stand by her side.\n\nScientists claim the XMRV is nothing to worry about. Perhaps you agree. Now is the time to take a look at the evidence presented by these scientists who declare there is no relationship between XMRV and disease. You may want to reconsider.\n\nFor those paying attention, there are serious concerns to our current vaccination schedule in America. In a previous post I gave 8 of those that I felt were important enough for me to not vaccinate my daughter. In this article we look at 8 more reasons. Do any of these resonate with you?\n\nStudies Find Flu Shots Can Harm Your Heart, Infant And Fetus Flu vaccines, according to the best scientific evidence available today, will only work against 10% of the circulating viruses that cause the symptoms of seasonal epidemic influenza. So, do the theoretical benefits really outweigh the known harms?\n\nWhooping Cough: The Reality Behind the Myth The campaign to blame unvaccinated kids and their parents for the recent whooping cough outbreaks is in high gear. It is time to take a close look at the published, peer-reviewed medical literature to unearth the reality behind the myth.\n\nWhy Whooping Cough Vaccine Does Not Work As Advertised A newly published article written by a former WHO vaccine committee member, has revealed that estimates for pertussis vaccine efficacy have been greatly inflated because of inaccurate case definitions adopted by the WHO in 1991 which required laboratory confirmation and 21 days or more of paroxysmal cough, excluding and therefore concealing a veritable submerged iceberg of vaccine-resistant cases of pertussis infection.\n\nThe evidence against vaccine safety and effectiveness is massive. Here is a 300+ page research download of National Library of Medicine abstracts showing there are over 200 adverse effects of the vaccines in the CDC schedule, including death.\n\nWhy Is Nobody Studying Vitamin C In Whooping Cough? Last year I wrote a document entitled \"The Vitamin C treatment of Whooping Cough\" in order to meet the needs of parents who seek treatment that is safe and effective. I have first hand experience of its effectiveness and there is old literature to suggest that even low doses of Vitamin C help reduce the severity and duration of the cough.", "opengraph": {"image": "//cdn.greenmedinfo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ogimage/Vaccine_27.jpg", "title": "Vaccination: Pertussis", "type": "website", "url": "https://greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-pertussis"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/blog/finally-truth-emerges-about-whooping-cough-vaccine-obs-and-pediatricians-stand-1", "/blog/finally-truth-emerges-about-whooping-cough-vaccine-obs-and-pediatricians-stand-1", "/gmi-blogs/drbrogan", "/blog/healing-vaccine-injuries-through-homeopathy", "/blog/healing-vaccine-injuries-through-homeopathy", "/gmi-blogs/jthomas", "/blog/vaccination-agenda-implicit-transhumanismdehumanism", "/blog/vaccination-agenda-implicit-transhumanismdehumanism", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/dr-judy-mikovits-joins-greenmedinfo-advisory-board-welcome-revolution", "/blog/dr-judy-mikovits-joins-greenmedinfo-advisory-board-welcome-revolution", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/plague-update-xmrv", "/blog/plague-update-xmrv", "/gmi-blogs/kentheckenlively", "/blog/8-more-reasons-i-haven%E2%80%99t-vaccinated-my-daughter-2", "/blog/8-more-reasons-i-haven%E2%80%99t-vaccinated-my-daughter-2", "/gmi-blogs/jamesprimarycare", "/blog/newsweek-op-ed-absurdly-lies-vaccination-entails-no-health-risks", "/blog/newsweek-op-ed-absurdly-lies-vaccination-entails-no-health-risks", "/gmi-blogs/JeremyHammond", "/blog/studies-find-flu-shots-can-harm-your-heart-infant-and-fetus", "/blog/studies-find-flu-shots-can-harm-your-heart-infant-and-fetus", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/episode-59-human-retroviruses-chronic-illness-scientific-prejudice-0", "/blog/episode-59-human-retroviruses-chronic-illness-scientific-prejudice-0", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/does-vaccinating-pregnant-women-really-slash-risk-pertussis-infants-first-4", "/blog/does-vaccinating-pregnant-women-really-slash-risk-pertussis-infants-first-4", "/gmi-blogs/suzannemd", "/blog/attacking-ourselves-top-doctors-reveal-vaccines-turn-our-immune-system-against-us", "/blog/attacking-ourselves-top-doctors-reveal-vaccines-turn-our-immune-system-against-us", "/gmi-blogs/celestewriter", "/blog/pro-life-and-pro-vaccine-ultimate-hypocrisy", "/blog/pro-life-and-pro-vaccine-ultimate-hypocrisy", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/herd-immunity-myth-or-reality", "/blog/herd-immunity-myth-or-reality", "/gmi-blogs/vaccineillusion", "/blog/future-vaccines-video1", "/blog/future-vaccines-video1", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/your-unborn-baby-part-vaccine-experiment", "/blog/your-unborn-baby-part-vaccine-experiment", "/gmi-blogs/christina.england.btinternet.com", "/blog/whooping-cough-reality-behind-myth", "/blog/whooping-cough-reality-behind-myth", "/gmi-blogs/tysonperez", "/blog/microbiome-and-vaccine-industry", "/blog/microbiome-and-vaccine-industry", "/gmi-blogs/Keith%20Bell", "/blog/why-whooping-cough-vaccine-does-not-work-advertised", "/blog/why-whooping-cough-vaccine-does-not-work-advertised", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/plague-brought-you-best-intentions", "/blog/plague-brought-you-best-intentions", "/gmi-blogs/kentheckenlively", "/blog/whos-private-vaccine-laboratory-developing-world", "/blog/whos-private-vaccine-laboratory-developing-world", "/gmi-blogs/christina.england.btinternet.com", "/blog/rob-schneider-s-uncensored-press-release-vaccination", "/blog/rob-schneider-s-uncensored-press-release-vaccination", "/gmi-blogs/jeffereyjaxen", "/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20Research%20Group", "/blog/why-nobody-studying-vitamin-c-whooping-cough", "/blog/why-nobody-studying-vitamin-c-whooping-cough", "/gmi-blogs/suzannemd"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
