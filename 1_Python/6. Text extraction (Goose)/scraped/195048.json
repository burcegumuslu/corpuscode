As part of the unapologetic news censorship, hideously unethical, child-sacrificing publishers like The Atlantic absurdly LIE to their readers, claiming vaccines never harm anyone at all (see this Jeremy Hammond investigative story for astonishing details).\n\nIn the UK press, however, vaccine injury stories are quite common. What follows here are partial postings from the UK Daily Mail and SWNS.com, a UK-based newswire service. Both of these stories tell the shocking, disturbing stories of young women whose lives have been destroyed by vaccines.\n\nRemember, HPV vaccines are medical violence against women\u2026 Any news organization that refuses to cover vaccine injury is helping greedy pharmaceutical corporations exploit the bodies of women for profit.\n\nTeenager\u2019s agony as she is left wheelchair-bound and feeling like an \u201980-year-old\u2019 as her parents claim controversial HPV vaccine is to blame\n\nA nurse claims her sporty 13-year-old daughter has been left wheelchair-bound after suffering an alleged reaction to the HPV vaccine.\n\nHeartbroken Anthea Beattie, 49, says Zara is an \u201980-year-old in a teenager\u2019s body\u2019 and is convinced her ill health is due to the jab, which protects against cervical cancer.\n\nThe sporty schoolgirl, once a promising footballer and netball player, began struggling for breath in a PE lesson in January last year shortly after she had been given the vaccine.\n\nAt first the family dismissed Zara\u2019s symptoms as asthma, but her health continued to deteriorate in the weeks that followed.\n\nShe suffered palpitations, felt dizzy, weak and tired, and was later diagnosed with PoTS \u2013 postural tachycardia syndrome \u2013 which makes her heart race.\n\nMrs Beattie said: \u2018It has been horrendous. She said to me, \u201cMum, I would rather be dead than like this.\u201d She is 13 and she said, \u201cI feel like somebody put me in an 80-year-old\u2019s body.\u201d\u2018\n\nEighteen months on, Zara, of Wigton, Cumbria, feels faint every time she stands, is unable to leave the house without a wheelchair and is home-schooled.\n\nSitting at the table to eat a meal leaves her exhausted and she spends 24 hours a day seven days a week at home, unless she has a hospital appointment.\n\nDoctors have refused to confirm their fears, but mother-of-three Anthea and her husband Ian, 54, an engineer, believe Zara\u2019s condition was triggered by the vaccine.\n\nAnthea, who has been forced to reduce her hours to care for Zara, said: \u2018I have been a nurse for 30 years and I have never heard or seen anything like this before.\n\n\u2018There are so many young girls now who are in the same position. I don\u2019t believe it is a coincidence.\n\nZara was vaccinated with Gardasil at The Nelson Thomlinson School in Wigton in October 2015.\n\nRead the rest of this story at the UK Daily Mail website. which also carries this heartwarming photo, (c) SWNS.com (link below), with more photos posted at the UK Daily Mail article page:\n\nParents Call For Research Into HVP Jab After Teen Daughter Is Left Paralysed\n\nA teenage dancer has been paralysed from the waist down and may never walk again after having the controversial HPV cervical cancer vaccine.\n\nChloe Brookes-Holder, 18, was a normal 12-year-old who danced six days a week and dreamed of a career on stage when she had the jab at school.\n\nBut in the months that followed the healthy teenager fell ill with dizziness, headaches, fatigue and bone and joint pain, and her muscles weakened.\n\nShe has since lost three stone \u2013 dropping from 8st 2oz to just 5st \u2013 has lost all feeling in her legs and is fed through a tube.\n\nShocking photos show the teenager\u2019s emaciated body, hooked up to wires and drips, as she lies in hospital, where she has spent most of the last 12 months.\n\nDevastatingly, the pretty teen has been told she may never walk again \u2013 let alone waltz about a dance floor \u2013 because she still has no feeling in her lower body.\n\n\u201cWe thought the vaccine was safe because they give it in schools and on the letter the parents were given to sign consent I remember reading \u201cit saves lives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWho on earth would turn a new, supposedly effective form of treatment down?\n\n\u201cWe trust our government to keep us safe but now, since getting sick from something the NHS gave me I don\u2019t trust any medical professionals that I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019ve been treated in such a barbaric way. Its been hell on earth.\n\n\u2026A year after having the injection, Chloe also began experiencing paralytic episodes and collapsing at school, unable to control her lower body.\n\nShe added: \u201cEvery day is a battle against the never ending symptoms. It is not \u2018just a coincidence\u2019 as those who don\u2019t want to believe it say.\n\n\u201cTo all mums, dads and daughters out there who are considering getting the vaccine \u2013 don\u2019t presume, do research and educate before you sign on the dotted line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not scaremongering, I just care about others. This is real. This is the pure ugly truth. I want to make people aware so they can make a decision for themselves.\u201d\n\nRead the rest of this story at SWNS.com which also carries photos of this vaccine victim.\n\nAlso from SWNS.com, see this story: Two Teens Left Paralysed After Having Controversial HPV Jab\n\n\u2026 then ask yourself: Why does the corporate-controlled U.S. press refuse to run a single story about all the young women across America who are being paralyzed, maimed and killed by vaccines?", "opengraph": {"title": "HPV vaccine turns young woman into a shriveled, tortured vaccine victim with severe pain that never goes away", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2017-05-08-hpv-vaccine-turns-woman-into-a-shriveled-tortured-vaccine-victim-with-severe-pain-that-never-goes-away.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "The entire corporate-controlled media in the United States maintains a total news blackout over the vaccine injuries that maim, disfigure and even kill children and teens across America.
