And because of the perceived authority of their pronouncements, most government officials and members of the media have believed them. But when the arguments these scientists employ to support their claims are subjected to scrutiny, it becomes clear that important facts have invariably been misrepresented \u2014 either deliberately or through substantial negligence. And when these facts are fairly considered, the arguments collapse (1).\n\nA prime example of a purportedly scientific \u2014 but in reality, inaccurate \u2014 publication on GM foods was issued by the UK\u2019s Royal Society in May 2016 (2). Titled \u201cGMO Plants: Questions and Answers,\u201d it claims to provide \u201cunbiased\u201d and \u201creliable\u201d answers to peoples\u2019 most pressing questions. However, analysis reveals that it not only displays a strong pro-GMO bias, but that several of its assertions are demonstrably false. The following paragraphs examine these defects and reveal the surprising extent to which that document, as well as previous publications of the Society about GM foods, conflict with the truth.\n\nThis analysis has major implications, because if the world\u2019s oldest and most respected scientific institution cannot argue for the safety of GM foods without systematically distorting the facts, it indicates that such distortion is essential to the argument.\n\nObfuscating the unnatural nature of the GM process and ignoring its unsettling features\n\nThe document\u2019s bias is evident from the outset, and the authors fail to furnish a forthright answer to the initial question: \u201cWhat is genetic modification (GM) of crops and how is it done?\u201d(3). Instead, their response is significantly misleading because it omits the most unnatural and unsettling features while downplaying the unnaturalness of those that are mentioned.\n\nFailing to note the randomness and disruptiveness of the insertion process\n\n In one of the biggest obfuscations, the authors avoid mentioning that biotechnicians have been inserting foreign DNA into plant genomes in a haphazard manner \u2014 and that the insertions not only disrupt the region of DNA into which they wedge but cause disruptions throughout the DNA strand, a well-documented phenomenon that some scientists call \u201cgenome scrambling.\u201d(4)\n\nConcealing the need to artificially induce gene expression\n\n The authors are equally evasive regarding how the foreign genes are induced to actually function, and they fail to disclose a crucial fact: that inserting a new gene does not in itself endow the plant with the desired new trait. That\u2019s because it\u2019s essential to convert the information encoded within the gene into a protein or other molecule, and in almost every case, that won\u2019t happen without artificial alteration of the inserted genetic material.\n\nThe default condition of most genes is to be inactive and blocked from expressing \u2014 which conserves the organism\u2019s energy and prevents proteins from being produced when and where they\u2019re not needed (5). A gene transitions from its closed-down default mode to its active mode through the operation of a regulatory element called a promoter, a segment of DNA adjoined to the gene that serves as its on/off switch. This switch is finely responsive to specific biochemical signals so that the gene expresses in harmony with the organism\u2019s needs. Consequently, when a gene is taken from one species and transferred to an unrelated one, the promoter will rarely (if ever) receive signals to which it\u2019s sensitive, and the gene will remain inactive. Hence, before making such transfers, biotechnicians must remove the native promoter and replace it with one that will reliably function in the foreign milieu. Moreover, to deliver the desired results, the promoter must in most cases not only induce the gene to express, but to boost its expression (and consequent protein production) to an extraordinary level.\n\nFor virtually every GM crop on the market, the potent promoter that\u2019s been used to achieve such unusual results comes from a plant virus. Not only does it impel the inserted genes to produce proteins at an abnormally elevated level, it drives the production continuously, regardless of the organism\u2019s needs and completely outside the intricate regulatory system through which its other genes are controlled. This can create serious problems by inducing metabolic imbalances or upsetting complex biochemical feedback loops.\n\nTherefore, given the crucial role played by viral promoters, and the degree to which their employment is unnatural, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that any purportedly balanced account of the GM process would mention them \u2014 and to deplore the Society\u2019s failure to do so.\n\nObscuring the disruptiveness of the process that transforms modified cells into whole plants\n\n The Royal Society authors are likewise elusive in explaining how an isolated plant cell that has incorporated new genes is subsequently turned into a mature plant. They say this is possible \u201cbecause individual plant cells have an impressive capacity to generate entire plants,\u201d but they neglect to disclose that this capacity can only be actualized through a distinctly artificial process \u2014 in contrast to natural seeds, which grow into plants spontaneously. That artificial process is called tissue culture, and although the authors note that it\u2019s employed, they say nothing more about it \u2014 which obscures the fact that through its procedures, the cell is \u201cforced to undergo abnormal developmental changes.\u201d(6) The authors also becloud the fact that besides being highly unnatural, tissue culture is highly disruptive and imparts what\u2019s referred to as a \u201cgenomic shock\u201d that causes numerous mutations throughout the plant\u2019s DNA.(7)\n\nThus, the authors\u2019 systematic avoidance of disquieting facts causes their account of the GM process to be significantly distorted \u2014 which, as will be seen, leads to the distortion of other key parts of their presentation as well.\n\nDenying the significant differences between GM crops and those bred conventionally\n\nBecause the authors acknowledge only the most obvious differences between GM and conventional breeding, while ignoring the lesser-known but more important ones, they\u2019re emboldened to claim that GM is no more likely to entail \u201cunforeseen effects.\u201d But this is flat-out false, and experts who have taken the key differences into account have decisively reached the opposite conclusion (8). For instance, a major report by the Royal Society of Canada concluded that GM is far more likely to induce unforeseen effects, and a report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has acknowledged this greater likelihood too (9).\n\nMisrepresenting Reality\n\n The authors attempt to support their spurious claim by arguing (1) that \u201call\u201d plant genomes \u201cfrequently\u201d receive insertions of new DNA through viral and bacterial infections and through the activity of \u2018jumping genes\u2019, (2) that these insertions are \u201csimilar\u201d to those made via GM, and (3) that conventional breeding is therefore just as likely to have unforeseen consequences.\n\nWhereas the genes that are inserted into plant cells via GM technology are always integrated into the entire genome of the resultant plant, genes from viruses and bacteria rarely enter plant genomes. Although viruses frequently infect plant cells, they seldom insert their genes into the DNA of the gametes (the sex cells), a necessary step for transferring to the plant\u2019s progeny and becoming established in the genome. Consequently, the few viral DNA sequences that are present within plant genomes have been there for an extremely long time \u2014 and during that time, the plants\u2019 defense mechanisms have inactivated them.\n\nFurther, scientists know of only two bacterial species that can insert their genes into the DNA of plants, and those genes are hardly ever incorporated into an entire genome (10). There are only three plant species in which such integrations have been observed, and just one is a food crop (sweet potato). Moreover, the bacterial genes in the potatoes have no discernible effect, are being transcribed at low levels, and either may not be producing any proteins at all or are producing very little (11).\n\nIn contrast, the new genes that are added to a plant\u2019s genome via GM not only produce proteins, they hyper-produce them, which could cause hazardous imbalances. As previously noted, this hyper-production is driven by a powerful viral promoter. While none of the active genes within conventionally bred crops are associated with that promoter, it\u2019s affixed to one or more active genes within the genome of virtually every commercialized GM crop (12).\n\nSo not only are insertions of bacterial and viral DNA into plant genomes exceptionally rare, and not only are they dissimilar from the insertions wrought by GM, it is through the GM process alone that new viral DNA has recently and widely entered plant genomes \u2014 and this incursion has introduced new risks.\n\nThe actual facts about \u2018jumping genes\u2019 are likewise at odds with the authors\u2019 claims. In reality, those segments of DNA, technically termed \u2018transposons\u2019, rarely mobilize in the absence of extraordinary stress; so most of their current locations have been stable since an ancient era (13). In fact, a GM plant is much more likely to harbor new transposon-induced perturbations than its parent because the GM process tends to activate transposons and get them jumping (14). Conversely, pollen-based breeding rarely causes transposons to move (15).\n\nReaching a patently false conclusion\n\n Thus, not only do the authors of the Society\u2019s guide fail to acknowledge the abundant evidence that demonstrates the disruptive effects of the GM process, they significantly misrepresent important biological realities that they do discuss. Only in this way can they conclude that GM is no more likely to entail unforeseen consequences than is conventional breeding (16).\n\nIn glaring contrast, the expert panel that produced the report of the Royal Society of Canada, who took account of the facts the guide\u2019s authors ignored or distorted, concluded that while pollen-based breeding rarely involves worrisome unintended outcomes, the \u201cdefault prediction\u201d for every GM crop should be that it entails unintended effects that are hard to predict, could be difficult to detect, and might be harmful to human health (17).\n\nWhich leads to the question of whether GM crops are safe, another issue that the authors of the guide have seriously mishandled.\n\nDeclaring the safety of GM crops by dishonoring the standards of science\n\n\u201cIs it safe to eat GM crops?\u201d Of all the questions the guide addresses, this is the most crucial. And it answers with a resounding \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBut this simple answer is simply unjustified.\n\nFor one thing, the unequivocal declaration that all GM crops are safe flies in the face of the World Health Organization\u2019s assertion that \u201cit is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods.\u201d As the WHO noted, because \u201cdifferent GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways\u201d it\u2019s necessary to assess them \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d Even the Royal Society\u2019s president emphasized the need for a case-by-case assessment in comments he released in conjunction with the guide\u2019s publication.\n\nUnjustifiably dismissing all the research that has detected harm\n\n So how do the authors attempt to support their all-inclusive claim? They declare: \u201cAll reliable evidence produced to date shows that currently available GM food is at least as safe to eat as nonGM food.\u201d And they assert \u201cthere has been no evidence of ill effects linked to the consumption of any approved GM crop.\u201d\n\nBut there has indeed been such evidence, and many studies published in peer-reviewed journals have detected ill effects to the animals that consumed a GM crop. For instance, a systematic review of the toxicological studies on GM foods that was published in 2009 concluded that the results of \u201cmost\u201d of them indicate that the products \u201cmay cause hepatic, pancreatic, renal, and reproductive effects and may alter hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters the significance of which remains unknown.\u201d It also noted that further studies were clearly needed (18). Another review that encompassed the additional studies that had been published up until August 2010 also provided cause for caution. It concluded that there was an \u201cequilibrium\u201d between the research groups \u201csuggesting\u201d that GM crops are as safe as their non-GM counterparts and \u201cthose raising still serious concerns.\u201d 19)\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014 there have been eight such reviews published in standard journals, and as a whole, they provide no grounds for unequivocally proclaiming safety. As Sheldon Krimsky, a professor at Tufts University, observed in a comprehensive examination that was also published in a peer-reviewed journal: \u201cOne cannot read these systematic reviews and conclude that the science on health effects of GMOs has been resolved within the scientific community.\u201d (20) Yet, the authors of the guide purport that it has been resolved conclusively \u2014 and that safety is a certitude.\n\nStooping to Subterfuge\n\n But to do so, they resort to trickery. They claim that only \u201ca few\u201d studies have stated that a GM food caused harm when in fact there have been many. They then summarily dismiss all these studies as unreliable. And to justify this wholesale rejection, they argue that each of the studies has been \u201cchallenged\u201d regarding its statistical analysis and methodology.\n\nBut based on that criterion, most of the studies that underlie their claim of safety are also unreliable, because they too have been challenged. Moreover, while the latter critiques have been reasonable and fair, most of those on which the Royal Society authors rely have not (21).\n\nDeceptively dealing with S\u00e9ralini\u2019s research\n\n The unfairness is strikingly displayed by the attacks on a long-term study that yielded disturbing results. In it, a team of university researchers led by Gilles-Eric S\u00e9ralini demonstrated that a GM crop approved by regulators based on a medium-term, 90-day toxicological feeding study caused significant damage to the rats\u2019 livers and kidneys when tested over the long-term (two years) (22).\n\nThose results cast doubt on the entire GM food venture because no regulators require tests greater than 90 days, and several GM crops have entered the market without any toxicological testing at all.\n\nSo when the study was published in a respected journal in 2012, proponents of GM crops bitterly denounced it and demanded its retraction. But because it was a solid toxicological study, they couldn\u2019t attack it on that ground. So they focused on the part of the study that reported an increased rate of tumor development in the GM-fed rats, and they argued that too few animals had been used to meet the standards for a carcinogenicity study.\n\nHowever, they disregarded several crucial facts:\n\n (1) The research was not designed to meet the standards of a carcinogenicity study.\n\n (2) It did fulfill the standards for a toxicological study.\n\n (3) The troubling toxicological results were reliable.\n\n (4) Tumors are supposed to be reported when detected during a toxicological study.\n\nNonetheless, despite the weakness of their claims, they continued to pressure the journal until, more than a year after publication \u2014 and after the addition of a former Monsanto employee to the editorial board \u2014 the study was finally retracted. But not only did the chief editor acknowledge the adequacy of the toxicological findings, the lone reason he proffered for rejecting the tumor-related findings was that they were \u201cinconclusive,\u201d which is not a valid reason for retraction. Furthermore, according to standard guidelines, even if there had been good grounds for retracting that part of the study, the remainder should not have been withdrawn along with it.\n\nS\u00e9ralini\u2019s illegitimately retracted paper is the only study the guide\u2019s authors cite to support their claim that all the ones which reported harm are unreliable. And though they emphasize its retraction, they don\u2019t mention any of the above-noted facts, imparting the false impression that none of its findings were reliable. Worse, they also fail to mention one other key fact: that the study was subsequently republished in another scientific journal. Because that happened almost a year before their guide was released, such an omission is inexcusable \u2014 and downright deceptive.\n\nFalsely asserting that no study has cast doubt on the GM method itself\n\n Moreover, besides unfairly rejecting the studies that reported problems, the authors don\u2019t even describe them fairly. For instance, they assert that none has indicated that \u201cthe GM method itself\u201d caused any harm and that all the problems have been attributed either to the specific gene introduced or to particular agricultural practices.\n\nBut this claim is doubly bogus.\n\nFirst, in almost all the cases, the researchers couldn\u2019t determine which specific factor or factors caused the harm, so they didn\u2019t pin the blame on a particular gene or herbicide \u2014and the GM process was never absolved. Further, the only study on an herbicide-tolerant GM crop designed to separately assess the roles of the herbicide and the plant found that each caused harm \u2014 and that the plant was harmful even when unsprayed (23). And because the exact source of the plant-induced harm could not be ascertained, some feature of the GM process may well have been at fault.\n\nSecond, at least one major study did specifically link the GM process with harm. And the Royal Society is well aware of that study because it led the sordid attempt to discredit it.\n\nMisrepresenting and maligning Pusztai\u2019s important research\n\n That study was conducted at the Rowett Institute under the leadership of a renowned authority on food safety testing, Arpad Pusztai. It revealed that GM potatoes producing a foreign protein that\u2019s safe for mammals to eat caused a problematic effect in the rats that consumed them compared to rats that ate the non-GM counterparts, even though the latter had been spiked with the same level of foreign protein within the modified potatoes. Accordingly, the researchers concluded that some aspect of the GM process itself was significantly responsible for the result (24).\n\nBecause this research implicated the process \u2014 and implied there are inherent risks in producing any GM food \u2014 the technology\u2019s defenders ardently assailed it, with the Royal Society at the forefront. Even before it was published, nineteen of the Society\u2019s fellows disparaged it in an open letter without having seen all the data; and the Society then conducted a biased and unwarrantedly critical review even though the research was still unpublished and the reviewers had not seen all the data either. So irregular and unfair was the Society\u2019s review that the editor of the prestigious journal, The Lancet, rebuked the organization for its \u201cbreathtaking impertinence\u201d and its \u201creckless\u201d abandonment of the principle of due process (25). The Society subsequently put \u201cintense pressure\u201d on the Lancet to deter it from publishing the research (26), and even after that journal published it, the Society continued to unjustly malign it (27).\n\nSo, having been unable to honestly refute the research, and having also failed to block its publication in a premier journal, the Society now blatantly misrepresents its express findings, falsely asserting they have no bearing on the safety of the GM process itself. And to aggravate the injustice, it claims that the mere fact it attacked the study robs it of reliability \u2014 while ignoring the fact that the attack was demonstrably unfair (28).\n\nReports by Other Scientific Organizations Similarly Abuse the Facts\n\nRegrettably, the Royal Society is not the only scientific institution that abuses the evidence in order to protect GM foods. It\u2019s been significantly distorted by every report that asserts their safety has been established.\n\nFurther, like those of the Royal Society, the other reports are especially unjust in dealing with the Pusztai and S\u00e9ralini studies, presumably because presenting them in a fair manner would cast considerable doubt on the safety of GM foods. Such maltreatment is exemplified by the report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences issued in 2016 (29). Although the authors were supposed to assess the safety of GM crops by considering the evidence that had accumulated since 1996, they didn\u2019t even mention Pusztai\u2019s research, despite the fact it was published in an eminent journal in 1999. And while they did discuss S\u00e9ralini\u2019s study, they entirely ignored the valid (and troubling) toxicological findings. Instead, they focused solely on the disputed tumor-related data \u2014 and emphasized that those data were alleged to be \u201cinconclusive\u201d by the editor of the journal that retracted the study. They then asserted that the inconclusiveness refutes the contention that long-term studies are needed to adequately assess the safety of GM foods, even though the toxicological data they ignored clearly do demonstrate the need.\n\nThe Falsehoods Are Propping Up the GM Food Venture \u2014 But Undermining Science\n\nThe preceding analysis has clearly shown that, despite its aura of authority, the Royal Society\u2019s 2016 publication substantially ignores the principles of science and systematically misrepresents the facts. It\u2019s also clear that if that document, and similar documents claiming to demonstrate the safety of GM foods, had upheld science and properly portrayed the facts, the massive venture to produce and promote those foods could not have survived.\n\nIt is additionally obvious that there\u2019s an urgent need for reform on the part of the Royal Society and all other scientists and scientific institutions that assert the safety of GM foods. As the eminent biologist Philip Regal has pointed out, what\u2019s at stake is not only the safety of our food and the future of agriculture, but the future of science itself. It\u2019s disquieting that most scientists\u2019 opinions about GM foods have been molded by misinformation \u2014 and that a relatively small group who ardently promote these products have misled a multitude of others into supporting them as well. In one of the most astonishing incidents, just a few scientists induced more than 120 Nobel laureates to sign a letter extolling the safety of GM foods and censuring the people who raise concerns, even though most of the letter\u2019s chief assertions are demonstrably false (30).\n\nThere\u2019s added urgency because the authority of science is being persistently challenged regarding climate change and other major issues, and when influential scientific institutions sully their integrity in one area, it weakens the stature of science across the board.\n\nAccordingly, it\u2019s imperative that the scientists who have been promoting GM foods re-evaluate their priorities, rededicate themselves to the standards they were trained to uphold, and restore the honest communication of facts. Our food will be safer, agriculture will be sounder, and science will be healthier.\n\n[1] Altered Genes, Twisted Truth thoroughly backs this statement up; and it demonstrates that various publications purporting to establish the safety of GM foods issued by the Royal Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association, and similar organizations rely on multiple misrepresentations. John Ikerd, Professor Emeritus of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Missouri, has stated that the evidence with which the book documents this systematic twisting of the truth is \u201ccomprehensive and irrefutable.\u201d\n\n[2] \u201cGM Plants: Questions and Answers,\u201d The Royal Society (May 2016).\n\n[3] The Royal Society\u2019s guide employs the terms \u2018genetic modification\u2019 and \u2018GM process\u2019 to exclusively refer to the methods that have been used to create almost all the genetically engineered crops currently on the market, and those methods are the focus of its discussion. It does not deal with newer techniques, such as those referred to as \u2018genome editing.\u2019 Accordingly, this article discusses the GM process on which the guide is focused.\n\n[4] Wilson, AK, Latham, JR and Steinbrecher,RA \u201cGenome Scrambling -Myth or Reality?

Transformation-Induced Mutations in Transgenic Crop Plants.\u201d (cited in note 4) at p. 1.\n\n[7] The term \u201cgenomic shock\u201d has been used in connection with tissue culture by several biologists. One example is: Kaeppler et al., \u201cEpigenetic aspects of somaclonal variation in plants,\u201d Plant Molecular Biology 43 (2000): 179\u201388; 181.\n\n[8] There are some modes of non-GM crop development that induce a greater number of unpredictable effects than pollen-based reproduction, and many GM proponents claim that two of them (inducing mutations via radiation and via chemicals) have greater potential to do so than does GM. However, not only are there are sound reasons to contest this claim (as explained in Altered Genes, Twisted Truth), because the guide\u2019s authors employ the term \u2018conventional breeding\u2019 to denote only pollen-based reproduction, the soundness of their assertions must be judged by comparing the properties of that particular mode with GM.\n\n[9] \u201cElements of Precaution: Recommendations for the Regulation of Food Biotechnology in Canada.\u201d The Royal Society of Canada (January 2001). National Research Council and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (NAS), \u201cSafety of Genetically Engineered Foods: Approaches to Assessing Unintended Health Effects\u201d (Washington D.C.: The National Academies Press, 2004). The chart on page 240 of this report indicates that the processes used to produce the vast majority of the GM crops that have been cultivated and consumed are many times more likely to induce unintended effects than is pollen-based breeding, even when the effects of tissue culture are not factored in.\n\n[10] The species are Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The rarity of finding their genes within plant genomes is discussed in: Matveeva, T. et al., \u201cHorizontal Gene Transfer from Genus Agrobacterium to the Plant Linaria in Nature,\u201d Mol Plant Microbe Interact 25, no. 12 [December 2012]: 1542-51.\n\n[11] T. Kyndt, et al. \u201c The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs\n\n[12] Because the virus containing that promoter is not a retrovirus but a pararetrovirus, its DNA ordinarily doesn\u2019t even enter the DNA of the plant cells that it does infect, let alone the entire genome of plants. And in cases where it may have been inadvertently integrated into a genome, it would most likely have been inactivated.\n\n[13] Fedoroff, N. and Brown, N.M., Mendel in the Kitchen: A Scientist Looks at Genetically Modified Foods (Washington, DC: Joseph Henry Press, 2004) p. 103.\n\n[14] Transposons can be activated through the disruptions caused by the insertion process and also through those induced by tissue culture. And some scientists think they could also mobilize due to destabilizing effects of the powerful viral promoters.\n\n[15] Mendel in the Kitchen (cited in note 13) pp. 104-05. However, Fedoroff points out that wide crosses between \u201cvery distantly related plants\u201d can activate transposons.\n\n[16] The key issue is whether GM is more likely than conventional breeding to induce unexpected, potentially harmful changes in a new plant that were not present in the parental generation. And it\u2019s clear that the likelihood is greater \u2014 especially considering that the guide\u2019s authors employ the term \u2018conventional breeding\u2019 to refer solely to pollen-based reproduction.\n\n[18] Dona, A., and I.

(Bateson, P., \u201cMavericks are not always right,\u201d Science and Public Affairs, June 2002.) The unjustness of the Society\u2019s attack is more extensively described and documented in Chapter 10 of Altered Genes, Twisted Truth.\n\n[28] Although the authors do not specifically mention the Pusztai study, or any studies besides the long-term one conducted by Seralini\u2019s team, their categorical assertions logically encompass it; and those assertions misrepresent it.\n\n[29] National Academy of Sciences, \u201cGenetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects\u201d (Washington D.C.: The National Academies Press, 2016)\n\n[30] For an examination of the letter\u2019s inaccuracies, see the article I co-authored with David Schubert, a professor and laboratory director at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.\n\nSteven M. Druker is an American public interest attorney who, as executive director of the Alliance for Bio-Integrity, initiated a lawsuit that exposed how deceptions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had enabled the commercialization of GM foods.\n\nHe is the author of Altered Genes, Twisted Truth: How the Venture to Genetically Engineer Our Food Has Subverted Science, Corrupted Government, and Systematically Deceived the Public, which was released in March 2015 with high praise from many experts and a foreword by Jane Goodall hailing it as \u201cwithout doubt one of the most important books of the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nIf this article was useful to you please consider sharing it with your networks.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Health Risks of GMOs Have Been Systematically Misrepresented", "description": "Scientists and scientific institutions, such as the UK Royal Society, have been misrepresenting the science of GMO safety", "url": "https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-uks-royal-society-how-the-health-risks-of-gmos-have-been-systematically-misrepresented/", "site_name": "Independent Science News | Food, Health and Agriculture Bioscience News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BioSRP/", "article:published_time": "2017-08-14T00:01:49+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-08-14T00:59:30+00:00", "image": "https://www.independentsciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Royal-Societys-Building.jpg", "image:width": "466", "image:height": "429", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["maize", "agroecology", "FDA", "Golden Rice", "EPA", "Bt", "rice", "technology", "heritability", "crop", "plants", "regulation", "EFSA", "roundup", "health", "nutrition", "risks", "DNA", "transgenic", "disease", "environment", "GM", "coronavirus", "virus", "pesticide", "Vitamin A", "public interest", "USDA", "safety", "transgene", "biotechnology", "science", "development", "animal", "medical", "food", "monsanto", "genetics", "agriculture", "genetically modified", "predisposition", "risk assessment", "farming", "GMO", "ecology"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/gm-plants/gm-plant-q-and-a.pdf", "http://bsr.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BSR-2-BGERvol23.pdf", "http://rsc-src.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/GMreportEN.pdf", "http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10977&page=R1", "http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989835/", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412011000055", "https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23395/genetically-engineered-crops-experiences-and-prospects", "https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/gm-plants/gm-plant-q-and-a.pdf", "http://www.econexus.info/publication/genome-scrambling-%E2%80%93-myth-or-reality", "http://www.econexus.info/publication/mutational-consequences-plant-transformation", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989835/", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412011000055", "http://earthopensource.org/earth-open-source-reports/gmo-myths-and-truths-2nd-edition/", "https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23395/genetically-engineered-crops-experiences-and-prospects", "http://gmwatch.org/news/latest-news/17320", "http://www.biointegrity.org/", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/ALTERED-GENES-TWISTED-TRUTH-Systematically-ebook/dp/B00U2LY3D2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=1-1&qid=1435068032", "http://www.alteredgenestwistedtruth.com/", "#"], "authors": ["Jonathan Latham"], "publish_date": "2017-08-14T00:01:49+00:00"}
