Posted in Latest news\n\n\u201cGive me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man.\u201d\n\nSesame Street has sold its soul \u2014 your children\u2019s souls too, if you\u2019ll let it \u2014 to the Great Reset.\n\nIt has teamed up with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to make a series of videos educating children about the vital importance of learning to live with the \u2018New Normal\u2019: wearing masks, maintaining six feet social distancing, gratefully accepting their vaccine shots, getting used to not playing with friends in person but just meeting them virtually on a screen\u2026\n\nOn a World Economic Forum podcast called \u2018The Great Reset: Resetting education with Sesame Street\u2019, the blue Sesame Street puppet Grover tells his impressionable young listeners:\n\n\u201cAt first it was hard when nobody could go to school and I could not visit my friends like Elmo or, well, even Oscar the Grouch. But then we learned to have video play time. It was a lot of fun and made me feel better.\u201d\n\nJust in case any children fail to understand that the Great Reset is their friend, Grover is on hand to make a hilarious joke about it.\n\nThen he adds: \u201cResetting the entire world. That is a very big job.\u201d\n\nAt no point, obviously, does either Grover the blue sock puppet, or his handler Sherrie Westin \u2014 President of Social Impact and Philanthropy at Sesame Workshop \u2014 raise the possibility that the world might not actually need or want a \u2018Great Reset\u2019. Its importance is a given.\n\nOn a separate video \u2014 one of a series \u2014 Grover encourages young children to wear masks and maintain six-foot social distancing in public.\n\nAgain neither Grover nor his sinister controllers at the non-profit Sesame Workshop appear to be aware that these are deeply contentious positions, that many parents may be strongly opposed to their children wearing masks and highly skeptical about the need for them to maintain six-foot social distancing.\n\n\u201cCaring for each other because we are all in this together,\u201d says Grover.\n\nIn a separate video, another Sesame Street character, Elmo, is shown going to the doctor to get a vaccine shot.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Sesame Street website explains that this\n\nSome of us are old enough to remember an era when this kind of blatant propaganda came only from countries behind the Iron Curtain and when we in the West treated it with the appropriate scorn and horror.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the case if the Great Reset gets its way. It will become the New Normal.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sesame Street Sells Out Its Soul To The Great Reset", "description": "Sesame Street has sold its soul \u2014 your children\u2019s souls too \u2014 to the Great Reset.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2020-11-23T13:31:07+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sesame-street-grover.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/11/18/the-great-reset-is-trending-heres-why/", "https://soundcloud.com/world-economic-forum/resetting-education-with", "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/sesame-and-the-muppets-the-great-reset-podcast/", "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/11/21/delingpole-sesame-street-sells-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Sesame%20Street%20Sells%20Out%20Its%20Soul%20To%20The%20Great%20Reset&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fsesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sesame-street-sells-out-its-soul-to-the-great-reset/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2020-11-23T13:31:07+00:00"}
