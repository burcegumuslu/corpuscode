It is too easy, they argued, for foreign and malign actors to quickly \u201cgo viral\u201d at low cost, leaving the good guys unable to correct bad information. We must become more \u201cresilient\u201d to disinformation.\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that all of that rhetoric was cover for a sweeping censorship effort by the federal government and government contractors.\n\nSince December, a small but growing group of journalists, analysts, and researchers have documented the rise of a \u201cCensorship Industrial Complex\u201d, a network of U.S. government agencies, and government-funded think tanks. Over the last six years, these entities have coordinated their efforts to both spread disinformation and to censor journalists, politicians, and ordinary Americans. They have done so directly and indirectly, including by playing good cop/bad cop with Twitter and Facebook. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of people have been involved in these censorship and disinformation campaigns in the U.S., Canada, and the UK.\n\nWe now know, thanks to the Twitter Files, emails released by the Attorney Generals of Missouri and Louisiana, and research by others, that the Censorship Industrial Complex is violating the First Amendment by coordinating with government agencies and receiving government funding to pressure and help social media companies to both censor information, including accurate information, while spreading disinformation, including conspiracy theories.\n\nAnd such efforts are continuing if not accelerating. At Biden\u2019s \u201cSummit for Democracy\u201d last week, US allies in Europe demanded that Facebook censor \u201cfalse narratives\u201d and news that would \u201cweaken our support to Ukraine.\u201d Facebook agreed.\n\nOne of the most intelligent, influential, and fascinating public-facing leaders of the Censorship Industrial Complex is Renee DiResta, Research Manager of the Stanford Internet Observatory. Diresta has, more than anyone else, made the public case for greater government-led and government-funded censorship, writing for The New York Times, The Atlantic, Wired, and other major publications, and through public speaking, including on podcasts with Joe Rogan and Sam Harris.\n\nTo many journalists and policymakers, DiResta is one of the good guys, advocating as a citizen and hobbyist for greater U.S. government action to fight disinformation. DiResta has argued that the U.S. has been unprepared to fight the \u201cinformation war\u201d with Russia and other nations in her bylined articles for the New York Times, Washington Post, Wired, and many others. And in her 2018 Senate testimony DiResta advocated \u201clegislation that defines and criminalizes foreign propaganda\u201d and for allowing law enforcement to \u201cprosecute foreign propaganda.\u201d\n\nDiResta, as much as any other public person in the Western world, has sounded the alarm, repeatedly and loudly, for stronger governmental and non-governmental coordination to get social media platforms to censor more information. \u201cThe Russian disinformation operations that affected the 2016 United States presidential election are by no means over,\u201d wrote DiResta in the New York Times in December 2018. \u201cRussian interference through social media is a chronic, widespread, and identifiable condition that we must now aggressively manage.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, DiResta advocated for creating a government censorship center, which she euphemistically referred to as a \u201cCenter of Excellence,\u201d within the federal government. \u201cCreation of a \u2018Center of Excellence\u2019 within the federal government,\u201d she said, \u201ccould tie in a federal lead with platforms, academics, and nonprofits to stay ahead of these emerging narratives and trends.\u201d DiResta argued that her censorship center could also help spread propaganda. \u201cAs narratives emerge,\u201d she explained, \u201cthe Center of Excellence could deploy experts to relevant federal agencies to help prepare pre-bunking and messaging, to identify trusted voices in communities, and to build coalitions to respond.\u201d\n\nDid the Department of Homeland Security act on DiResta\u2019s proposal to create a censorship center? It did. But DHS didn\u2019t call it a \u201cCenter of Excellence.\u201d Instead, it called it a \u201cDisinformation Governance Board,\u201d which the agency announced publicly in April 2022.\n\nDiResta\u2019s rise to the highest levels of the U.S. intelligence community struck me back in December of last year as improbably meteoric. DiResta had repeatedly described her involvement in fighting disinformation as having started in 2013 when she became a new mom and grew concerned about spreading anti-vaccine information online. \u201cIn 2013,\u201d she explained to Kara Swisher, \u201cI had my first kid\u2026 You know, you have to do that preschool thing here, you\u2019ve got to get them on a list a year early. I didn\u2019t want to be in a preschool with a bunch of anti-vaxxers, candidly.\u201d Two years later she was helping to fight ISIS online and by 2018 she was testifying before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nWhile these suspicions nagged at me, I waved them away because DiResta is brilliant, was already working in high tech, and was succeeding in the new field of fighting foreign disinformation on social media platforms. Of all the people in various government agencies and government-funded think tanks making the case for U.S. government censorship, DiResta is, by far, the most persuasive. She received a degree in computer science in 2004, worked as a trader at Jane Street until 2011, was a high-tech VC until 2014, and founded a cloud-based shipping management software company that was acquired in 2021.\n\nAnd, given the historical dominance of high tech by founders in their 20s and 30s, and the challenges of older people to understand social media, I convinced myself that a person with DiResta\u2019s limited experience battling disinformation online might leapfrog over the hundreds if not thousands of researchers, analysts, and intelligence experts who conduct research and combat foreign disinformation for the U.S. government and government-funded think tanks and academic institutions.\n\nBut then I learned that DiResta had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The journalist Matt Taibbi pointed me to the investigative research into the censorship industry by Mike Benz, a former State Department official in charge of cybersecurity. Benz had discovered a little-viewed video of her supervisor at the Stanford Internet Observatory, Alex Stamos, mentioning in an off-hand way that DiResta had previously \u201cworked for the CIA.\u201d\n\nIn her response to my criticism of her on Joe Rogan, DiResta acknowledged but then waved away her CIA connection. \u201cMy purported secret-agent double life was an undergraduate student fellowship at CIA, ending in 2004 \u2014 years prior to Twitter\u2019s founding,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve had no affiliation since.\u201d\n\nBut DiResta\u2019s acknowledgment of her connection to the CIA is significant, if only because she hid it for so long. DiResta\u2019s LinkedIn includes her undergraduate education at Stony Brook University, graduating in 2004, and her job as a trader at Jane Street from October 2004 to May 2011, but does not mention her time at the CIA.\n\nAnd, notably, the CIA describes its fellowships as covering precisely the issues in which DiResta is an expert. \u201cAs an Intelligence Analyst Intern for CIA, you will work on teams alongside full-time analysts, studying and evaluating information from all available sources\u2014classified and unclassified\u2014and then analyzing it to provide timely and objective assessments to customers such as the President, National Security Council, and other U.S. policymakers.\u201d\n\nUnlike DiResta, Stamos didn\u2019t appear to believe that DiResta\u2019s time working for the CIA was too trivial, or too far in the past, to bother mentioning. When Stamos introduced DiResta to a Stanford audience, he described her as having \u201cworked for,\u201d not merely \u201cinterned\u201d with, the CIA.\n\nIs DiResta telling the truth when she claims she\u2019s had \u201cno affiliation since\u201d? Perhaps. But one of the things I have heard from multiple people, including people within the intelligence community, is, \u201cNobody ever retires from the intelligence community.\u201d Such a claim is, no doubt, exaggerated. But there is truth to it. Moreover, one of the main characteristics of spycraft is the deployment of agents and assets not publicly affiliated with the CIA or other intelligence agencies.\n\nA large amount of CIA involvement in content moderation requests was discovered through Twitter Files. \u201cCIA officials attended at least one conference with Twitter in the summer of 2020,\u201d writes Taibbi, \u201cand companies like Twitter and Facebook received \u2018OGA [Other Government Agencies, which is code for CIA] briefings,\u2019 at their regular \u2018industry meetings held in conjunction with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAnd it is striking how many former CIA Directors are involved in the censorship industry. Seven former CIA chiefs are on the board of The Atlantic Council, the organization that partnered with DiResta\u2019s Stanford Internet Observatory on the Election Integrity Partnership and Virality Project. The Chief Strategy Officer and the Director of Federal Programs at Graphika, another DiResta partner organization, are former CIA officials.\n\nWhatever DiResta\u2019s true history and continuing affiliations, she is without question one of the most, if not the most, influential leaders within the network of for-profit and nonprofit organizations and government agencies that comprise the Censorship-Industrial Complex. As research director of Stanford Internet Observatory, DiResta was the key leader and spokesperson of both the 2021 \u201cVirality Project,\u201d against covid vaccine \u201cmisinformation\u201d and the 2020 \u201cElection Integrity Project.\u201d\n\nThe question now is why. If we hope to defund and dismantle the Censorship Industrial Complex, we must understand what makes its leaders tick, why they rose to the top, and how they can be defeated. Who is Renee DiResta, and why is she, and not somebody else, the public-facing leader of the censorship industry and a trusted advisor to Democrats in Congress? Why is she doing it? And what will it take to defund the Stanford Internet Observatory, dismantle the censorship industry, and disempower DiResta?\n\nTo answer those questions, we first need to understand how DiResta got away with and was even rewarded for participating in one of the most outrageous and likely illegal, election disinformation campaigns in recent history.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2a9e55-059a-4333-a713-82594fc0c4be_1600x900.jpeg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/guide-understanding-hoax-century-thirteen-ways-looking-disinformation", "https://www.racket.news/p/capsule-summaries-of-all-twitter", "https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/guide-understanding-hoax-century-thirteen-ways-looking-disinformation", "https://www.discoursemagazine.com/culture-and-society/2023/03/30/disinformation-is-the-word-i-use-when-i-want-you-to-shut-up/", "https://www.foundationforfreedomonline.com/", "https://censorshipindustrialcomplex.org/", "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/08/white-house-renews-call-to-remove-section-230-liability-shield-00055771", "https://www.racket.news/p/capsule-summaries-of-all-twitter", "https://public.substack.com/p/under-white-house-pressure-facebook", "https://www.foundationforfreedomonline.com/", "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/03/29/world/russia-ukraine-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare#ukraine-disinformation-eu-social-media", "http://www.reneediresta.com/", "https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-rdiresta-080118.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNe4MJ351wU&t=2s", "https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-immigration-media-europe-misinformation-4e873389889bb1d9e2ad8659d9975e9d", "https://www.vox.com/2018/7/14/17566188/transcript-data-for-democracy-policy-head-renee-diresta-answers-disinformation-too-embarrassed", "https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/CHRG-115shrg30959.pdf", "https://www.foundationforfreedomonline.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESR9k0BtmXY", "https://reneediresta.substack.com/p/fiction-vs-reality-my-texts-with", "https://reneediresta.substack.com/p/fiction-vs-reality-my-texts-with", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneediresta/details/experience/", "https://www.cia.gov/careers/jobs/directorate-of-analysis-fellowship-program/", "https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1606701397109796866", "https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/shellenberger-testimony.pdf", "https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/shellenberger-testimony.pdf", "https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1636729166631432195", "https://public.substack.com/p/why-renee-diresta-leads-the-censorship?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
