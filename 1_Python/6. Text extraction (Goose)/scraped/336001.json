Yet I confess I\u2019m increasingly frustrated that the \u2018something\u2019 to which many of you have committed is nowhere near enough.\n\n\u201cAnd while progress is being made all over the world, the gulf between what has been promised, what is actually being delivered, and what needs to happen \u2026 it remains vast.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "BoJo Scolds World Leaders for Lacklustre COP26 Climate Finance Commitments", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/09/21/bojo-scolds-world-leaders-for-lacklustre-cop26-climate-finance-commitments/", "description": "As Britain turns to coal to fend off blackouts during the Europe wide wind drought, British PM Boris Johnson has scolded other world leaders for not agreeing to a shutdown of the coal industry.", "article:published_time": "2021-09-21T17:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-21T11:55:44+00:00", "site_name": "Watts Up With That?", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/COP26-Wheres-the-Money.png?fit=720%2C466&ssl=1", "image:width": "720", "image:height": "466", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Boris Johnson"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.smh.com.au/by/bevan-shields-givwf0", "https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/boris-johnson-rebukes-world-leaders-on-climate-change-and-warns-history-will-judge-them-20210921-p58tct.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-09-21T17:00:00+00:00"}
