Mike DeWine signed legislation that prohibits \u201ca public school or state institution of higher education shall not . . . Require an individual to receive a vaccine for which the United States food and drug administration has not granted full approval.\u201d\n\nWith Comirnaty not being available anywhere in the United States, it would seem impossible for any entity within the state to legally mandate a COVID-19 vaccine.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CDC Confirms Comirnaty NOT Available In USA, Meaning No FDA-Approved COVID Vax Is Available To Americans", "description": "The CDC has confirmed that Comirnaty is not currently available in the USA, meaning no FDA-approved Covid vaccine is available to Americans.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/cdc-confirms-comirnaty-not-available-usa-meaning-no-fda-approved-covid-vax-available-americans/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2021-12-23T19:29:51+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-23T19:38:08+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/covid-gb340e4ce1_1920.jpg", "image:width": "1920", "image:height": "1277", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Comirnaty", "COVID Vaccine", "FDA", "Coronavirus Vaccine", "Pfizer"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EXCLUSIVE: Pfizer Won't Confirm FDA-Approved Comirnaty Vaccine Is Available To Americans<a href=\"https://t.co/AMzEV3mtMh\">https://t.co/AMzEV3mtMh</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 National File (@NationalFile) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NationalFile/status/1471600118986067978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/10/20/fact-check-comirnaty-pfizers-fda-approved-vaccine-available-us/8538861002/", "https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/qa-comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-mrna", "https://nationalfile.com/exclusive-pfizer-wont-confirm-fda-approved-comirnaty-vaccine-available-americans/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/COVID-19-related-codes.html", "https://t.co/AMzEV3mtMh", "https://twitter.com/NationalFile/status/1471600118986067978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/comirnaty/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/coronavirus-vaccine/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-vaccine/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/fda/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/pfizer/"], "authors": ["National File News"], "publish_date": "2021-12-23T19:29:51+00:00"}
