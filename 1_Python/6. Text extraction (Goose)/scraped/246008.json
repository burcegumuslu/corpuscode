The civil court action was brought by Del Bigtree, the founder of Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nActivist attorney RFK Jr. claims vindication in showing that \u201cvaccine safety\u201d as we know it is nothing more than a sham.Government agencies charged with protecting the public are shown not to be doing their part to ensure and improve the safety of immunizations.\n\nRFK Jr. and ICAN take on DHHS\n\nAs sources explain, a clause in The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NVICA) compels DHHS to take responsibility for improving vaccine safety and efficacy, and charges the agency with constant monitoring and improving of adverse event reporting. The Mandate for Safer Childhood Vaccines clause also tasks DHHS with providing a report on improvements made in these areas to Congress every two years.\n\nRKF Jr. and ICAN reportedly suspected that DHHS was failing to meet this responsibility, and filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the records of these biennial reports. For eight months, DHHS tried to blockade their request and refused to provide information. Ultimately, a lawsuit had to be filed.\n\nICAN was therefore forced to file a lawsuit to force HHS to either provide copies of its biennial vaccine safety reports to Congress or admit it never filed these reports. The result of the lawsuit is that HHS had to finally and shockingly admit that it never, not even once, submitted a single biennial report to Congress detailing the improvements in vaccine safety. This speaks volumes to the seriousness by which vaccine safety is treated at HHS and heightens the concern that HHS doesn\u2019t have a clue as to the actual safety profile of the now 29 doses, and growing, of vaccines given by one year of age.\n\nDespite being charged with the responsibility of investigating and improving vaccine safety DHHS has apparently failed to meet even the most basic aspects of this duty by failing to file a single report for the past thirty years. Three decades have passed since NVICA was put into place, and DHHS has never so much as raised a finger towards vaccine safety \u2014 an issue which should be a top priority, especially given the fact that NVICA erases industry responsibility regarding vaccine injuries.\n\nSo not only is the government granting Big Pharma carte blanche on the matter of vaccine injury, yet another agency charged with protecting the public from vaccines has completely dropped the ball.\n\nICAN reports further that DHHS hasn\u2019t eschewed their vaccine responsibilities entirely: The organization has reportedly taken their obligation to promote vaccine uptake very seriously, spending billions and conducting regular reports on how to increase vaccination rates.\n\nRegrettably, HHS has chosen to focus on its obligation to increase vaccine uptake and defend against any claim vaccines cause harm in the National Injury Vaccine Compensation Program (aka, the Vaccine Court) to such a degree that it has abandoned its vaccine safety responsibilities. If HHS is not, as confirmed in Court this week, even fulfilling the simple task of filing a biennial report on vaccine safety improvements, there is little hope that HHS is actually tackling the much harder job of actually improving vaccine safety.\n\nWill the DHHS finally be held accountable for their failure, or will the vaccine industry continue to spread its toxic injections without fear of government scrutiny?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Principia Scientific Intl. | A science-based community", "type": "blog", "title": "U.S. Government Defeated in Vaccine Safety Lawsuit | Principia Scientific Intl.", "description": "Government agencies charged with protecting the public are shown not to be doing their part to ensure and improve the safety of immunizations.", "url": "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/", "image": "https://principia-scientific.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rfk-jr.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://principia-scientific.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rfk-jr.jpg", "image:width": "805", "image:height": "428"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": null, "height": null, "embed_code": "<iframe id=\"fitvid0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FHLyL8_C9Y?feature=oembed&amp;amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FHLyL8_C9Y?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"}], "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaccine?src=hash", "https://t.co/X5CzcurI9X", "https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1035566897574699009", "https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1035566897574699009", "https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256", "https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1035566897574699009", "https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-11-11-rfk-jr-wins-case-us-government-vaccine-safety-violations.html#", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=twitter", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=facebook", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=telegram", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=custom-1654796357", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=linkedin", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=reddit", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20U.S.%20Government%20Defeated%20in%20Vaccine%20Safety%20Lawsuit&body=https%3A%2F%2Fprincipia-scientific.com%2Fu-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit%2F&share=email", "#", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=pinterest", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=pocket", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=tumblr", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=skype", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://principia-scientific.com/u-s-government-defeated-in-vaccine-safety-lawsuit/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "November 12, 2018"}
