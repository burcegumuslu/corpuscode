I can understand why, for a while, some thought we were crazy. Population reduction was being done quietly through abortion, vaccines to sterilize people in Third World countries, promoting the gay lifestyle that can only bear children through surrogates, and convincing people that bringing a child into this world is a sin.\n\nFor years, the Left have bemoaned the burden of overpopulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. This is so horrible to contemplate that we shouldn\u2019t even say it. But the general situation in which we are involved is lamentable.\u201d Jacques Yves Cousteau\n\n\u201cEither we reduce the world\u2019s population voluntarily or nature will do this for us, but brutally.\u201d Maurice Strong\n\nWe may get to the point where the only way of saving the world will be for industrial civilization to collapse. Maurice Strong\n\nThe world\u2019s population has more than tripled to seven billion since Ted Turner was born 73 years ago. He believes it must be stabilized at near two billion, or \u201cwe\u2019re just going to have more and more catastrophes.\u201d Ted Turner\n\n\u201cWhat we need to have for 100 years is a one-child policy \u2026If everybody voluntarily had one child for 100 years, we\u2019d basically be back to two billon people.\u201d Ted Turner\n\n\u201cWe may get to the point where the only way of saving the world will be for industrial civilization to collapse.\u201d Maurice Strong\n\nThe biographer of billionaire investor and donor Warren Buffett describes him as having \u201ca Malthusian dread\u201d of population growth among the poor. In 1964 he set up an Omaha foundation centered on stopping that growth, both domestically and abroad, and to this day, the New York Times summarizes, \u201cmost of the foundation\u2019s spending goes to abortion and contraception.\u201d\n\nBuffett\u2019s charity, the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, has contributed $1.5 billion to help fund the abortion industry in the U.S., making it the largest financial backer of abortion in the country. Between 2003-2018, Buffett\u2019s foundation donated $565 million in support of \u201creproductive rights.\u201d His first public undertaking came in 1952, when he initiated the convocation of the Conference on Population Problems, in Williamsburg, Va. The discussion took up food supply, industrial development, depletion of natural resources, and political instability resulting from unchecked population growth. The presence of medical doctors, chemists, geologists, economists, and other scientists gave serious weight and prominent attention to the emerging and unrecognized facts of demographic change.\n\nSoon after this conference, Rockefeller established the Population Council. From philanthropic funds at his disposal, he provided $1 million within the first year of operations.\n\n\u201cIf the millions of dollars which are now expended in the care and maintenance of those who in all kindness should never have been brought into this world were converted to a system of bonuses to unfit parents, paying them to refrain from further parenthood, and continuing to pay them while they controlled their procreative faculties, this would not only be a profitable investment, but the salvation of American civilization.\n\n\u201cI believe that now, immediately there should be national sterilisation for certain dysgenic types of our population who are being encouraged to breed and would die out were the government not feeding them.\u201d\n\nAnd our government in the mid-1960s\u201d when the U.S. Congress, responding to the agitation of overpopulation ideologues, finally appropriated federal funds to underwrite first domestic and then foreign population control programs. Suddenly, instead of mere millions, there were hundreds of millions and eventually billions of dollars available to fund global campaigns of mass abortion and forced sterilization. The result would be human catastrophe on a worldwide scale.\u201d\n\nNow, besides using the COVID vaccine to sterilize people, the globalists are getting up-front about eugenics.\n\nThey actually have become comfortable saying they want to reduce the population and now we are seeing our food supply being shut down. Hmmm. Do you think there might be a connection? Food storage and production plants burning down. Farmland gobbled up by the global elites. Big portions of 5 states being made sterile so carbon (which is not deleterious to us or the land or the air) can be piped a thousand feet below the surface.\n\nSome of us little people are up in arms over the promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) over \u201cgas guzzlers\u201d. Could it be that the intention is that the rich will be the only ones who can afford to purchase them. Under Agenda 21 nobody but the rich are supposed to be left on this earth to want to purchase them.\n\nWhen you see something that doesn\u2019t add up, guess what? It probably doesn\u2019t in the real-world, but it certainly will in the Agenda 21/Sustainable Development world. As Richard Gardener\u2019s 1974 article, \u201cThe Hard Road to World Order\u201d, notes \u201cIn short, the \u2018house of world order\u2019 will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great \u2018booming, buzzing confusion\u2019, to use William James\u2019 famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.\u201d And that is exactly what we are seeing in our schools, in movies and television, even in governing bodies. There it is, in black and white, stated almost 50 years ago, now in full bloom. And using asymmetrical warfare \u2013 nary a shot fired \u2013 yet.\n\nThis has been the plan in the making for over 100 years. Those behind it have had pretty much free rein for most of that time. Oh, yes, we have had victories over the years, but in the scheme of things, they are but blips. I\u2019ll drop my snark and quit bemoaning the fact that too many felt more comfortable being conned \u2013 it was easier.\n\nIt is time to get to work, to get the silent majority speaking out, building freedom pods, organizing their neighbors to be a bulwark against the aggression that will soon be upon them. Our civilization can only survive if we stand up en masse and in time. We are doing just that. And achieving great victories, but, so far, our victories are few compared to the Left\u2019s. Please don\u2019t wait until the food runs out before you speak out. The seeds of Agenda 21 were spread beginning at the end of the 19th Century, sown in 1976 in the Vancouver Declaration, birthed in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, and has gone through early childhood, and adolescence with the Millennial Goals, Goals 2020, and is maturing with the Green New Deal and the Great Reset. We didn\u2019t nip it in the bud, but we need to take its head off now before it is too late.\n\nGet organized and stand up for what is right.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "American Policy Center", "title": "What part of Agenda 21 didn\u2019t you get?", "url": "https://americanpolicy.org/2022/07/22/what-part-of-agenda-21-didnt-you-get/", "type": "article", "description": "Sorry, but we have been telling you for over 30 years that the globalists want to reduce the population by over 90%.
