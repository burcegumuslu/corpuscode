(Revelation 13:16-17) The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world\u2019s great men. By your medicines* all the nations were led astray. (Revelation 18:23)\n\nWashington and Moscow put aside their differences for the greater good\n\nBy all accounts, the G20 summit in Bali was a smashing success. After tireless multipolar efforts, the famed intergovernmental forum announced the creation of a global health-preserving Pandemic Fund sponsored by the WHO, the World Bank, Bill Gates, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The fund will ensure there is plenty of money for experimental genetic vaccines in the weeks, months, and decades ahead.\n\nIn the same spirit of cooperation, Moscow suggested enveloping the whole world in Virus-detecting kiosks\u2014a proposal based on Russia\u2019s own \u201csanitary shield\u201d program.\n\nBut these are mere trifles compared to the forum\u2019s crowning achievement: the adoption of the G20 Bali Leaders\u2019 Declaration.\n\nFrom page eight of the document:\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the IHR (2005), to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations. We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.\n\nIf you want to read the whole thing, you can download the PDF generously hosted on the Kremlin\u2019s official website.\n\nThe titillating declaration includes much more than just a pledge to create an international injection Ausweis. Contained within its pages are purple prose about \u201csustainable development\u201d, \u201cdigital transformation\u201d, \u201cinteroperability of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border payments\u201d, and many other tasty multipolar morsels.\n\nThere is even a line about how the conflict in Ukraine is \u201cexacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy.\u201d\n\nThe G20 has issued a formal decree promoting vaccine passports as preparation for any future pandemic response in its final communique. Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin, speaking on the matter on behalf of the G20 host country, had earlier in the summit called for a \u201cdigital health certificate\u201d using WHO standards.\n\nSadikin advocated for that he dubbed a \u201cdigital health certificate\u201d which shows whether a person has been \u201cvaccinated or tested properly\u201d so that only then \u201cyou can move around\u201d. Watch his comments during a G20 Bali panel discussion earlier in the week\u2026\n\nThe following is introduced in Article 23:\n\nInterestingly, the next paragraph of the formal declaration, article 24, goes on to describe the need to for global institutions to fight against \u2018disinformation\u2019.\n\nArticle 24 of the final G20 declaration begins, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the digital ecosystem and digital economy.\u201d\n\nAnd then leads into to the following statement later in the section: \u201cWe acknowledge the importance to counter disinformation campaigns, cyber threats, online abuse, and ensuring security in connectivity infrastructure.\u201d\n\nSo as predicted by many early on in the pandemic (who were all dismissed and condemned as \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d), a future proposed standardized vaccine passport will be accompanied by efforts for greater standardization and policing against \u2018disinformation\u2019 \u2013 likely to include any speech critical of the type of regimen that G20 leaders wish to enact.\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nThe God of All Comfort\n\nYear 2023: Will America Fulfill Its Destiny?
