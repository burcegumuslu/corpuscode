News.com.au estimates 15,000 people took part in the march. Many chanted anti-lockdown slogans and held signs calling for \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\nFootage on social media shows thousands of demonstrators marching through Sydney\u2019s downtown area.\n\nThere was a significant police presence, including mounted police and riot control officers in response to what authorities said was an \u201cunauthorized protest.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrators defied restrictions on non-essential travel and mass public gatherings that could be extended through October.\n\nThe Greater Sydney area has been locked down for a month as infections rise.\n\nProtesters were also seen in Melbourne and Adelaide.\n\nThere\u2019s discontent with Australians being forced into lockdowns again as an outbreak of the delta variant began last month.\n\nProtests are not limited to Australia. New COVID rules have been implemented across Europe as Delta infections flare-up, which demonstrators in France and Greece recently took to the streets. The UK has even triggered widespread panic through a new app that notified tens of thousands of people they must quarantine for ten days because of possible exposure.\n\nMultiple US cities are now requiring people to wear masks indoors amid surging cases.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Protesters Rage Across Europe as Lockdown, Vaccination Mandates Begin", "description": "Anti-lockdown protests kicked into high gear around the globe on Saturday.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/protesters-rage-across-europe-as-lockdown-vaccination-mandates-begin/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-07-25T05:07:17+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ytyutyutyut-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SCENE IN DUBLIN: \u201ctake off your fucking mask\u201d<br/> <a href=\"https://t.co/xVREKxQLVy\">pic.twitter.com/xVREKxQLVy</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 The_Real_Fly (@The_Real_Fly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_Real_Fly/status/1419066067570278404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">JUST IN ?
