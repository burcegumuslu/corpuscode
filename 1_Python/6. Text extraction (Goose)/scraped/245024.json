Doctors Say It\u2019s Rare, but Possible", "cleaned_text": "Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released data on the number of people who still contracted COVID-19 after becoming fully vaccinated: There have been about 5,800 cases out of more than 75 million people who have been immunized (that\u2019s about .007%).\n\nKnown as breakthrough infections, these cases are pretty rare but expected, according to Anthony Fauci, M.D., director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cA \u2018breakthrough infection,\u2019 or a vaccine failure, is when a person contracts an infection despite being vaccinated against it,\u201d Dr. Fauci said at a recent White House press briefing. \u201cWe see this with all vaccines in clinical trials. And in the real world, no vaccine is 100% efficacious or effective, which means that you will always see breakthrough infections regardless of the efficacy of your vaccine.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Prevention, the CDC said there has been \u201cno unexpected patterns\u201d in the cases. \u201cLike is seen with other vaccines, we expect thousands of vaccine breakthrough cases will occur even though the vaccine is working as expected,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEven though your risk of a breakthrough infection is low, it\u2019s understandable if you still have questions, especially as highly infectious variants continue to circulate throughout the country. Here\u2019s what doctors want you to know.\n\nFirst, a recap on effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nData from clinical trials shows that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use are up to 95% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of the virus in people who are fully vaccinated. Here\u2019s a breakdown of efficacy rate for each one:\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, though, that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been temporarily \u201cpaused\u201d in the U.S. due to six reported cases of rare but severe blood clots, although further evidence is needed to prove direct causation. \u201cRight now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare, per a joint statement from the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The pause will continue out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d as the agencies conduct a thorough investigation.\n\nSo, how can you still get COVID-19 after you get the vaccine?\n\nThere are a few different ways this can happen, and the reasons fall into one of two camps: primary and secondary failure, says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cPrimary failure is when you get vaccinated and you don\u2019t get enough of an immune response to protect your body from infection,\u201d he explains. This is more likely to happen in people with weakened immune systems such as older adults and those who have an underlying condition. Indeed, the CDC found that just over 40% of the reported breakthrough cases were in people aged 60 and older so far.\n\nClinical trials typically don\u2019t include immunocompromised people, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. \u201cThe efficacy [for elderly and immunocompromised people] may not be as high as the levels in the people in the clinical trials,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Schaffner agrees. \u201cThese people are not going to get 95% protection,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, they may get 50% or even less.\u201d The reason: Research has found that antibodies produced by vaccines tend to be less robust in older people. \n\n\n\nSecondary failure refers to what happens when immunity fades over time, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re not really seeing secondary failure because not enough time has passed,\u201d he says. Scientists are still studying how long the vaccines offer protection. Pfizer and Moderna have said their respective vaccines offer strong immunity for up to six months according to the data that\u2019s available so far, but experts predict that it will likely last for up to a year.\n\nAnother potential cause of breakthrough cases could be COVID-19 variants, Dr. Russo says. While research has found that the vaccines are largely still effective against certain strains, questions still remain, especially in the case of B.1.351, the variant originally detected in South Africa, he says.\n\nPeople can also become infected right before or after they\u2019re vaccinated, Dr. Schaffner points out. \u201cSuppose you got infected two days before you got the vaccine\u2014before your immune system can respond to the vaccine\u2014then the infection will take hold,\u201d he says. \u201cThis could also happen if you became infected shortly after you got the vaccine.\u201d\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to remember that the vaccines are not a silver bullet and don\u2019t prevent COVID-19 every single time\u2014\u201c95% is not 100%,\u201d Dr. Russo notes.\n\nHow to tell the difference between COVID-19 symptoms and vaccine side effects\n\nIf you aren\u2019t feeling well\u2014but were recently vaccinated\u2014you might be wondering if you have COVID-19. While there is some potential overlap between COVID-19 symptoms and vaccine side effects, there are a few distinct differences.\n\n\u201cVaccine side effects are largely going to be injection site pain, and you may have some muscle aches and pains, fever, and a mild headache,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to last long\u2014they should be done in a day or two.\u201d\n\nVaccine side effects also shouldn\u2019t include a cough, shortness of breath, or a loss of taste or smell\u2014all potential signs of COVID-19.\n\nIf you\u2019re having symptoms well after you\u2019ve been vaccinated and they don\u2019t seem to be improving, Dr. Schaffner recommends getting tested for COVID-19 just in case. \u201cThere is overlap between vaccine side effects and COVID-19 symptoms, no doubt,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is any uncertainty, please go get tested.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
