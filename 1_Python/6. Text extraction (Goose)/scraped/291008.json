Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nGermany\u2019s Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach \u2014 a former adjunct professor at Harvard University \u2014 this week admitted that COVID-19 vaccine adverse events are prevalent and that those suffering from severe vaccine injuries are being ignored.\n\nLauterbach, one of Germany\u2019s foremost voices in favor of strict COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates, made the comments in a March 12 interview on ZDF, Germany\u2019s national public television broadcaster.\n\nAs recently as February 2022, Lauterbach claimed COVID-19 vaccines are free of side effects.\n\nLauterbach\u2019s admission came amid allegations he previously falsified his academic credentials.\n\n1 in 10,000 incidence of severe adverse events from COVID vaccines\n\nDuring the interview on ZDF\u2019s \u201cHeute Journal,\u201d Lauterbach admitted the incidence of severe adverse events from the COVID-19 vaccines was 1 in 10,000 people.\n\n\u201cAccording to the latest research data, severe vaccine injuries are very rare. The incidence is less than 1:10,000 vaccinations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been aware of the numbers. They have remained relatively stable. \u2026 1:10,000: some may say that\u2019s a lot, and some may say it\u2019s not that much.\u201d\n\nDespite describing the incidence of severe adverse effects as \u201cvery rare,\u201d Lauterbach backtracked on earlier claims that the COVID-19 vaccines did not cause side effects.\n\nOn Aug. 14, 2021, Lauterbach tweeted that the COVID-19 vaccines had \u201cno side effects.\u201d\n\nZDF journalist Christian Sievers confronted Lauterbach on his previous claims, stating, \u201cYou\u2019ve always given the impression that side effects aren\u2019t really a thing.\u201d\n\nLauterbach replied that his 2021 statement \u201cwas an exaggeration that I once made in an ill-considered tweet,\u201d adding that \u201cit did not represent my true position.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lauterbach had repeated this same position in a February 2022 interview, when he said the COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cmore or less free of side effects.\u201d\n\nIn admitting to his \u201cunfortunately\u201d worded tweet, Lauterbach said some people who sustained severe adverse events from the COVID-19 vaccines will remain permanently disabled.\n\nThe injuries are unique and often not responsive to traditional medical interventions, Lauterbach said, adding that more research is needed to determine the appropriate treatment for these injuries.\n\nHe also said government agencies must do better at recognizing injuries related to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAccording to Lauterbach, German government compensation programs for vaccine injury victims are in poor shape. \u201cI can see why the people here are making complaints.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are slowly gaining a clearer understanding of the situation,\u201d in relation to COVID-19 vaccine injuries, noting that the vaccines are still in their initial phase 3 clinical experiments.\n\nAs of today, Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of Health website states, \u201cModern vaccines are safe and adverse effects only occur in sporadic cases.\u201d\n\nHowever, official data from Germany\u2019s Paul Ehrlich Institute, the country\u2019s federal institute for vaccines and biomedicines, indicate that as of Oct. 31, 2022, approximately 331,000 adverse events were reported after COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nOut of these 331,000-plus adverse events, 1,808 applications for relief under Germany\u2019s vaccine injury compensation program were filed as of January, and 253 claims were approved, German newspaper Welt reported on Jan. 28.\n\nIn March 2021, Lauterbach told Science, in response to safety concerns linked to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, that he would have allowed vaccinations to continue while the safety concerns were being investigated.\n\nLauterbach went as far as to express his hope that pharma companies will voluntarily offer compensation to those who sustained injuries from COVID-19 vaccines, on the basis that their \u201cprofits have been exorbitant.\u201d\n\nOn June 16, 2022, Lauterbach released a video in which he said, \u201cIn very rare cases, corresponding side effects may occur after corona vaccination\u201d \u2014 an indication he was rethinking his position on the vaccines prior to this week\u2019s more widely publicized interview.\n\nResponding to Lauterbach\u2019s March 12 statements, Byram Bridle, Ph.D., associate professor of viral immunology at Canada\u2019s University of Guelph, said the 1 in 10,000 figure regarding severe adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines is likely low.\n\n\u201cThis statistic is almost certainly an underestimation, due to the well-known under-reporting inherent to passive monitoring systems,\u201d Bridle wrote on his blog, \u201cespecially when coupled to pressures on physicians to parrot the \u2018safe and effective\u2019 motto,\u201d citing academic studies to this effect.\n\nNoting the safety concerns raised about the AstraZeneca vaccine, Bridle noted that Canada suspended use of the vaccine \u201cdue to its risk of causing severe adverse events (the main one was blood clotting) in 1:55,000 inoculated adults.\u201d\n\nAccording to Steve Kirsch, executive director of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, the true rate of serious adverse events is approximately 100 times greater than the figures Lauterbach cited \u2014 \u201ccloser to 1 in 100 doses\u201d and \u201cFor death, it is ~1 in 1,000 doses.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2022, Andreas Sch\u00f6fbeck, then-head of the German insurance company BKK ProVita, wrote a letter to the Paul Ehrlich Institute, stating that based on his company\u2019s data, adverse events related to the COVID-19 vaccines were under-reported by 1,000%. He told the institute that 217,000 of ProVita\u2019s 11 million clients received treatment for adverse events.\n\nThese revelations led Christine Anderson, a member of the European Parliament from Germany, on Feb. 25, 2022, to submit a question to the European Parliament regarding the \u201cvery significant under-reporting of suspected cases of COVID-19 vaccination side-effects\u201d and accusing the EU of ignoring \u201cvaccine failure.\u201d\n\nOn March 1, 2022, BKK ProVita fired Sch\u00f6fbeck. At the time, Dirk Heinrich, chairman of the Virchowbund, Germany\u2019s association of resident doctors, called Sch\u00f6fbeck and BKK \u201cbabbler[s] of alternative facts.\u201d\n\nLauterbach began his tenure as Germany\u2019s federal minister of health on Dec. 8, 2021. At the time, he was described by German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle as a \u201cvoice of reason\u201d and a \u201crecognized expert on COVID,\u201d adding that \u201cCOVID deniers and anti-vaxxers are especially pointed in their hatred of him, often sending him death threats.\u201d\n\nSoon after becoming health minister, Lauterbach became known for his hardline stance on COVID-19-related restrictions and vaccine mandates.\n\nDays after taking office, Lauterbach said unvaccinated health workers were \u201cabsolutely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nAnd by early January 2022, Lauterbach was calling for a national vaccine mandate, according to Deutsche Welle.\n\n\u201cWe still need a vaccine mandate,\u201d Lauterbach said. \u201cOtherwise, Omicron is a dirty vaccination through the backdoor. Counting on everyone getting infected sooner or later and becoming immune \u2026 would cause big problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cMandatory vaccination is also important for the future variants that may still develop. Omicron infection does not necessarily make one immune to the next viral variant,\u201d he added.\n\nBut a national vaccine mandate did not come to pass in Germany. On April 10, 2022, Deutsche Welle reported that \u201cthe proposal\u2019s failure is undermining trust in the government\u2019s pandemic plan.\u201d\n\nAnd on March 29, 2022, Lauterbach said he would propose the EU recommend a fourth COVID-19 vaccination for those over the age of 60.\n\nThis is not the first time Lauterbach, in his position as federal health minister, has faced challenges.\n\nOn the same day as his interview with ZDF, Welt revealed that in 1995, Lauterbach allegedly falsified his CV in order to attain a professorship at the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\nAccording to Welt, there were at least three instances where Lauterbach allegedly lied about his experience.\n\nIn his University of T\u00fcbingen application, Lauterbach, then 32, claimed he was running a government-funded project on breast cancer. The German Ministry of Health recently revealed that it is unaware of the existence of such a project. The project was funded to the tune of more than $1 million at the time.\n\nLauterbach also claimed he helped raise funds for a Princeton University study, but it was later confirmed he \u201cwas not involved in obtaining the grant.\u201d\n\nAnd in a third instance, Lauterbach claimed he received more than $10,000 in funding from the Robert Bosch Foundation for a study, \u201cEthics and Economics in Health Care.\u201d However, it was determined he never received the funds because he never completed the project in question.\n\nNevertheless, Lauterbach remains in his position as Federal Minister of Health as of this writing.\n\nLast year, \u201cvaccine skeptic\u201d lawyer Markus Haintz sued Lauterbach, accusing him of spreading fake news. However, a German court ruled that Lauterbach\u2019s statements are considered free speech \u2014 notably though not on the basis that his statements were scientific, but instead that they were political opinion.\n\nThe latest revelations about Lauterbach come just as his former counterpart in the U.K., Matt Hancock, became the primary target of a massive leak of WhatsApp messages.\n\nThe leak, known as the \u201cLockdown Files,\u201d revealed that he and the U.K. cabinet implemented lockdowns and proceeded with a mass COVID-19 vaccination program on the basis of political imperatives \u2014 and not scientific data.\n\nCOVID-19 narratives and measures continued to unravel in Europe in recent weeks.\n\nVienna, Austria, allowed its mask mandate for public transportation to lapse on Feb. 28, while Greece\u2019s government announced Tuesday that its mask mandate for public transportation and pharmacies has been rescinded.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "German Health Minister Reverses Course on COVID Vaccine Injuries, Says Injured Being Ignored", "description": "Germany\u2019s Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach \u2014 a former Harvard University adjunct professor \u2014 this week admitted that COVID-19 vaccine adverse events are prevalent and that those suffering from severe vaccine injuries are being ignored.", "url": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/karl-lauterbach-germany-covid-vaccine-injuries/", "site_name": "Children's Health Defense", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHealthDefense/", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-15T20:49:27+00:00", "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/germany-covid-vaccine-injuries-feature.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "834", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A historic moment on the 12th of March 2023: German health minister Karl Lauterbach has to admit, that there are people with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaccineinjuries?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#vaccineinjuries</a>.
