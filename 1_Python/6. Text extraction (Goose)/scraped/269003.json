Across Europe, concerns should have been growing about the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines for children.\n\nBecause by the end of 2022, excess deaths among children had increased by a shocking 1,580%.\n\nAccording to EuroMOMO, in the first 21 weeks of 2021, there were 346 fewer deaths than expected, meaning there were minus-346 or 0 excess deaths.\n\nHowever, as soon as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) extended the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to 12 to 15-year-olds in week 22 of 2021, the number of excess deaths began to rise, significantly.\n\nThese figures raise serious questions about why experimental gene therapy \u201cvaccines\u201d were pushed on children when the alleged Covid-19 virus was posing no risk to them.\n\nThis increase in excess deaths was of course not publicised in the mainstream media. But came as no surprise to those who were already aware of the heavily censored damage that Covid-19 vaccination was doing to adults.\n\nIf it had been publicised, instead of being swept under the carpet, it would have sparked widespread concern among parents who had chosen to vaccinate their children due to believing everything they are told by a man, in a suit, on the television.\n\nIt would have also prevented other parents from forcing their children to get a vaccine they simply did not, and do not need, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) extended the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer Covid-19 injection for use in 5 to 11-year-old children just a few months later.\n\nThis may have, prevented the shocking increase in excess deaths that were recorded among children in Europe up to the end of 2022.\n\nBecause the figures show that there were 466 fewer deaths than expected among children in Europe throughout the whole of 2020 at the height of the alleged pandemic.\n\nHowever, the pandemic didn\u2019t really hit Europe until around March 2020.\n\nThis makes the EMA\u2019s decision to jab children look even worse, as 616 fewer deaths were recorded among children at the height of the alleged pandemic.\n\nIn fact, the figures prove that children were in better shape than ever, and the alleged pandemic was not affecting them in any significant way.\n\nUnfortunately, following the emergency approval of the Covid vaccine for children, a staggering 1,953 excess deaths were recorded between week 22 of 2021 and week 52 of 2022.\n\nFor comparison, there were 334 excess deaths recorded among children between week 22 and week 52 of 2019. Unfortunately, when we couple this figure with child deaths recorded in 2020, we discover there were 132 fewer deaths than expected among children aged 0-14 across Europe.\n\nThe figures and correlation are clear:\n\nThe EMA approval of the Covid-19 vaccine for children caused a significant increase in excess deaths across Europe following a long period of children suffering far fewer deaths than expected prior to the approval.\n\nThankfully, the increase in deaths was enough to convince the UK Government that all healthy 5 to 11-year-olds should not be offered a Covid-19 vaccine. But only after they had realised it was killing children.\n\nIn September 2022, the UK Health Security Agency announced that it would no longer offer the Covid-19 vaccine to healthy children aged 5 to 11.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://expose-news.com/2023/03/02/pfizer-kills-children-for-profit/", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image.png?ssl=1", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png?ssl=1", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-ema-recommends-approval-children-aged-5-11", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-3.png?ssl=1", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-4.png?ssl=1", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/03/02/pfizer-kills-children-for-profit/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 3, 2023"}
