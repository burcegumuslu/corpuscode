Stranch, who spent her career as a private attorney litigator for Democrat Party interests\u2014and whose dissenting opinion was written by President Donald Trump appointed United States Circuit Judge Joan L. Larsen, a former associate justice of the Michigan Supreme Court and clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court during the 1994 term, and was a top legal expert in the President George W. Bush administration.\n\nAs one could expect, the majority decision written by Democrat Party activist-minion Judge Stranch is a leftist word salad of legal mumbling fully supporting the administrative state and whatever it wants to do against Americans\u2014and stands opposed to legal giant Judge Larsen writing in her dissent:\n\nIn the modern administrative state, many \u2018laws\u2019 emanate not from Congress but from administrative agencies, inasmuch as Congress has seen fit to vest broad rulemaking power in the executive branch.\n\nTo preserve at least a modicum of democratic protections, Congress created the notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which provide public notice of a proposed rule and an opportunity for the public to express its concerns.\n\nWhether successful or not, the aim is to ensure that agency \u2018rules\u2019 are also carefully crafted (with democratic values served by public participation) and developed only after assessment of relevant considerations.\n\nThis case, though, involves yet a more truncated process.\n\nCongress understood that emergencies might arise, and so it provided the Secretary with authority to bypass the public and the deliberative process, and to issue emergency temporary standards that \u201ctake immediate effect upon publication\u201d and remain effective for six months.\n\nBecause this is such a departure from the ordinary processes, federal courts have recognized this authority as the \u201cmost dramatic weapon in [OSHA\u2019s] enforcement arsenal.\u201d\n\nIt is an \u201cextraordinary power\u201d that \u201cshould be delicately exercised, and only in those emergency situations which require it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmergency standards are to be used only in limited situations\u201d and \u201conly as an unusual response to exceptional circumstances.\u201d\n\nPerhaps wary of misusing such immense authority, OSHA has rarely invoked it.\n\nThe agency has issued only ten previous emergency standards in the half-century that it has held that power. Six of those were challenged in court; five were struck down.\n\nTo illustrate OSHA\u2019s task, consider the danger from fire in a workplace: a pizzeria.\n\nOne way to protect the workers would be to require all employees to wear oven mitts all the time\u2014when taking phone orders, making deliveries, or pulling a pizza from the flames.\n\nThat would be effective\u2014no one would be burned\u2014but no one could think such an approach necessary.\n\nWhat OSHA\u2019s rule says is that vaccines or tests for nearly the whole American workforce will solve the problem; it does not explain why that solution is necessary.\n\nOn 20 December, the Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal issued a dire warning in their article \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s Covid Vaccine Test\u201d that said:: \u201cThe separation of powers is crucial to safeguarding individual liberty\u2026Justices now have two key tests on whether they will rein in the administrative state\u2026They will have to decide if they take their major question and non-delegation doctrines seriously, or are they merely seminars at the Federalist Society?\u201d\u2014and less than 48-hours later, the Supreme Court heeded this warning by ordering the extraordinary 7 January hearing.\n\nI bring your attention to this warning the Wall Street Journal issued to the Supreme Court, and their quick response to it, as an example to prove to you that your voice is being heard, and has smashed through the entire leftist mainstream propaganda media and big tech edifice created to silence you\u2014and that I can further evidence with the Dear Sisters report \u201cBiden Unleashes \u201cRed October\u201d Plot To Seize All Bank Accounts In America\u201d sent to you on 25 October, wherein it revealed Biden was attempting to appoint Marxist leader Saule Omarova as the top banking regulator so she could seize all the bank accounts in America\u2014a revelation that began a hidden battle to stop this outrage, that, on 7 December, ended in victory, as explained in articles like \u201cBiden Bank Regulator Pick Saule Omarova Withdraws After Senate Fight Over Her Background\u201d.\n\nAs you know, a war isn\u2019t fought all at once, it\u2019s a series of battles, some large, most small\u2014and in this present war that you\u2019re, most certainly, a part of, the side of freedom is winning more of these battles than we\u2019re losing.\n\nHowever, and as these battles intensify, this war can still be lost unless more of you begin supporting those of us fighting on and behind its front lines.\n\nWhen armed by your kind and generous support, the Dear Sisters are able to wield their powerful weapons of truth and facts to battle back against the dark forces of lies and deceptions\u2014so during this Christmas Season, can you please aid them with just a pittance of what Our Dear Lord has blessed you with?\n\nThank you for listening and aiding us in our hour of desperate need by going below and giving what you can, and as always, please feel free to write me at [email protected] with any comments/questions/suggestions, remembering to put ATTN: BRIAN in the subject line, or if requesting to be placed on the Sisters mailing list, put MAILING LIST in the subject line.\n\nAll the best folks,", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index3781.htm", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index3781.htm", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics#Predictive_models", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index3775.htm", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index3776.htm", "https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-business-health-880d2052bb4127fb40bcaaca98514753", "https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-business-health-880d2052bb4127fb40bcaaca98514753", "https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/122221zr2_f20h.pdf", "https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/confronting-the-administrative-state", "https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/21a0287p-06.pdf", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Branstetter_Stranch", "https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/21a0287p-06.pdf", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Larsen", "https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/21a0287p-06.pdf", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-supreme-courts-covid-vaccine-test-sixth-circuit-osha-mandate-11640034808?mod=hp_opin_pos_2#cxrecs_s", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-supreme-courts-covid-vaccine-test-sixth-circuit-osha-mandate-11640034808?mod=hp_opin_pos_2#cxrecs_s", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index3725.htm", "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/biden-bank-regulator-pick-saule-omarova-withdraws-after-senate-fight-over-her-background.html", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#44372b36272c2522252528042225373029252d286a2229", "https://fundrazr.com/f1fYo3?ref=sh_79C0K1_ab_1Kr7htbtQ5H1Kr7htbtQ5H", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
