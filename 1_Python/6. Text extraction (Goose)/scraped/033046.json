Rospotrebnadzor [the federal agency that operates Vector] explained: \u201cThe vaccine was obtained by successively \u2018turning off\u2019 six virulence genes in the original virus and is a genetic composition that forms stable immunity and at the same time has a high safety profile.\u201d\n\nAnna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor and also Russia\u2019s de facto COVID nanny, gave an interesting update on May 25.\n\nAccording to Popova, there\u2019s currently no need to carry out mass inoculation to protect against the monkeypox scourge. She further stated that anyone who has received a smallpox shot is shielded from this new potential health threat.\n\nBut then she added this:\n\nThree vaccines against smallpox are registered in Russia, all of which work well, but \u201ceach of them is very difficult to tolerate [a weird euphemism for \u2018side effects\u2019]\u201d Popova said. \u201cAlso, Vector has developed a new generation of reactogenic vaccine which does not cause strong reactions, and three weeks ago it was submitted for registration to the Ministry of Health. The documents were submitted, the full dossier for registration,\u201d she said and added that it is currently under search for a partner for production in Russia.\n\nYes. To sum up: It is not currently necessary to mass-vax Russians. But if for some reason it does become necessary, we created a safe and effective genetic shot in less than a month (??) because the already registered drugs can cause unpleasant side effects.\n\nBut also, how did Popova make this miracle slurry so quickly? If she applied for registration three weeks ago (from May 25), that would mean it was ready to go in early May\u2014when the first \u201ccase\u201d of \u201cmonkeypox\u201d was reported. How is that even possible?\n\nOr it was this genetic slurry just sitting on a shelf, waiting to be registered? Why do that? Why not register it immediately? HELP US UNDERSTAND.\n\nIt\u2019s all very science-y. By the way: Anna is an unapologetic WHO-lover who cannot stop dreaming about nibbling on Dr. Tedros\u2019 toes.\n\nBut watch out, Popova! You have competition:\n\nState-owned defense conglomerate Rostec has teamed up with Microgen (part of Rostec\u2019s Nacimbio pharmaceutical holding) to create its own high-tech smallpox vaccine.\n\nIn 2018, Nacimbio was designated the sole supplier of vaccines for Russia\u2019s National Calendar of Preventative Immunization. (We couldn\u2019t confirm if it still has this distinguished honor as of 2022.) In June 2020, the firm partnered with Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund (RDIF) to develop coronavirus therapies.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, RDIF is invested in a number of curious COVID \u201ctreatments.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Alexander Gintsburg\u2014Russia\u2019s Anthony Fauci\u2014is up to his usual shenanigans:\n\nSo\u2026 when does Russia leave the WHO and purge its \u201chealth\u201d ministry? It\u2019s kind of time sensitive.", "opengraph": {"title": "Russia Creates Genetic Smallpox Vaccine", "description": "Like all best vaccines it seems to have been developed in under 30 days", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/russia-creates-genetic-smallpox-vaccine/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/httpsbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437-6.jpg", "image:width": "700", "image:height": "400", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2022-05-31T10:30:41+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-31T10:35:17+02:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Politics", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/httpsbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437-6.jpg", "updated_time": "2022-05-31T10:35:17+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Vaccine cocktail advocates, we were the 1st to start joined trials with AstraZeneca in February and will be announcing more collaborations soon.
