The defendants include Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Linda L. Fagan, commandant of the Coast Guard; Lloyd Austin, secretary of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD); and Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nAll of the plaintiffs are either active-duty or reserve members of the Coast Guard, and all of them \u201chave sincerely held religious beliefs that prohibit them from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nReports indicate that the plaintiffs filed for a religious exemption from the mandate, which is their right, only to have the Coast Guard deny it. The Aug. 24, 2021 jab mandate from the DOD clearly states that there are to be \u201cmedical, administrative, and Religious Accommodation Requests (RARs) to the mandate.\u201d\n\nTwo days after the mandate was issued, the Coast Guard joined it, \u201cincorporat[ing] the provisions of the DOD mandate.\u201d (Related: Covid jabs are killing people.)\n\n\u201cIn practice, only servicemembers with medical or administrative reasons for an exemption from the mandate are accommodated, and even those sparingly, while RARs are universally denied unless the requester is eligible for administrative separation \u2013 i.e., imminently leaving the Service,\u201d the suit explains.\n\nThis \u201cconclusively demonstrates that the Armed Services have systematically and willfully violated service members\u2019 free exercise rights under RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] and the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nCoast Guard used \u201cformulaic language\u201d to deny exemptions with \u201cnearly identical form letters\u201d\n\nThe DOD mandate states that any service member who does not take the Fauci Flu shots will be involuntarily separated, which is what the plaintiffs currently face. They are also being discriminated against based on their vaccination status, which is unlawful.\n\n\u201cBecause of their vaccination status, Plaintiffs have been harassed, treated differently than their peers, singled out publicly by their leaders, had their normal leave and liberty restricted, been removed from senior / leadership positions, been denied promotion, received official discipline, been barred from training, travel, new assignments and permanent change of station (\u2018PCS\u2019) orders, and face imminent involuntary separation, all while they have continued to perform the mission alongside their \u2018vaccinated\u2019 peers, in many cases, while their \u2018vaccinated\u2019 peers got sick with COVID-19 in large numbers,\u201d the suit adds.\n\nThe plaintiffs also say that each of them received an identical letter of rejection from the Coast Guard using \u201cformulaic language.\u201d It appears as though nobody even read the exemption requests and instead just sent off patent form letters to every service member who filed one.\n\nAdditionally, none of the original 122 plaintiffs who filed for an exemption received a response within the required 30-day deadline.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the plaintiffs have natural immunity anyway \u2013 not that this should be a requirement to maintain bodily autonomy, just to be clear. This is just another point made in the lawsuit as to the illegitimacy of the DOD mandate for the Coast Guard.\n\nThe lawsuit also makes clear that the mRNA (messenger RNA) injections from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are not, in fact, vaccines, but rather \u201cgene-therapy treatments that meet none of the statutory and historical definitions to be considered \u2018vaccines.'\u201d\n\nMore Fauci Flu shot-related news can be found at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Hundreds of Coast Guard members sue Biden regime over covid vaccine mandates", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2022-08-04-coast-guard-sues-biden-covid-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "More than 130 members of the United States Coast Guard are suing the Biden regime for trying to force them to get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) against their religious beliefs.
