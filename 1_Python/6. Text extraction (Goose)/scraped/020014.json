The questions are: if this were to happen, would customs even notice? And if they did, would they ever tell the public?\n\nHidden in this questionable story are real concerns, exasperated by a new ruling that could make unlabeled and uninspected chicken and other meat from China more commonplace than ever.\n\nHere is what you must know before your next meat purchase.\n\nFake Meat Scandals Are a Serious Concern in China\n\nIn 2013, one of China\u2019s many food scandals was Chinese police catching traders who sold rat, fox, and mink meat (which was never inspected) as mutton, reported The New York Times. The 20,000 tons of fake mutton meat was mixed with gelatin, red pigment, and nitrates, and was worth $1.6 million.\n\nThat year, at least 904 people were arrested in China for selling fake or adulterated meats, and over 1,721 illicit factories and shops were broken up in the country.\n\nThe meat these people were selling included items injected with water and meat from previously diseased animals.\n\nChinese food problems do not originate in just the meat industry. The list of potential fake foods from scammers is long, and includes items such as chemical imitation eggs, mud-based \u201cblack pepper\u201d, corn \u201cpotato noodles,\u201d and plastic rice. (Read: Top 10 Toxic Fake Food Items Produced In China)\n\nCan these fake foods make it to the U.S.?\n\nThere Are 87 Import Alerts from China \u2013 The Most of All Countries\n\nAll import alerts can be accessed on the FDA\u2019s website. Right now, there are 87 alerts posted about imports from China. This number is followed by 72 from Mexico, 67 from Canada, 57 from India, and 52 from Hong Kong.\n\nMost of the alerts about China are from 2017, and a few are from as early as 2011.\n\nFood items that have been seized are:\n\nThese seized items come from a very small percentage of foods that have been inspected. Many fake or contaminated foods can therefore end up on U.S. shelves.\n\nNot even an organic label can prevent that from happening as up to 80% of all organic foods are imported. (Read: Fake \u201cOrganic\u201d Food From China is FLOODING Store Shelves.)\n\nUnfortunately for people who enjoy buying meat from the grocery store, the likelihood of purchasing a meat product from China, especially in the case of poultry, has also been on the rise recently.\n\nA May 2017 report from NPR detailed a massive new trade deal that opened up the Chinese beef market for U.S. exporters in exchange for increased access to U.S. customers for Chinese chicken producers.\n\nConsidering that country-of-origin labeling was revoked in 2016 and foreign meat can be sold without labeling in the United States (a new lawsuit is challenging the ruling), you could very well be eating meat or poultry from China right now without even knowing it, especially if you buy \u201cconventional\u201d meat products.\n\nEating imported Chinese meat may be a risky proposition, considering the roughly 500,000 cases of food safety violations recorded in the country in the first three quarters of 2016 alone.\n\nThe FDA Inspects Only a Small Number of Foods Coming from Overseas\n\nIn 2008, the FDA admitted that its own staffing issue makes it impossible to inspect every item coming from overseas. This includes drugs, medical devices, and food. It would take 1,900 years to examine every foreign food plant.\n\nOver the years this problem has led to deadly pet food and contaminated spinach reaching and endangering U.S. consumers.\n\nreport this adInspections of food from overseas have greatly declined over the years, adding to the chances of buying a contaminated product.\n\nIn 1973, the FDA handled 34,919 food inspections, but in 2006 \u2013 only 7,783. The number of import inspectors also dropped from 531 in 2003 to 380 in 2006.\n\nThe following year it was calculated that only 1.3% of imported foods are inspected, reported USA Today.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of imported goods grows by millions each year, and reached 36,000,000 products in 2016.\n\nWhen a small number of them do get inspected, many shipments are seized due to contamination: such as catfish from China, blackberries from Guatemala, jalapenos from Peru, beans from Belgium and more.\n\nUnfortunately, since our food safety institutions don\u2019t seem to realize the gravity of the problems being caused by Chinese and other uninspected imports, the one real solution for avoiding possible contaminations is to know your farmer and food makers, and to buy as local as possible (or grow your own food).\n\nThe smaller the food and more local the food producer is, the fewer hands the food goes through before ending up on your plate, and therefore, the less chance of contamination.\n\nAt any rate, it\u2019s certainly better than buying food imported from countries thousands of miles away like China, where lax regulations and little accountability are a dream for producers, and a potential nightmare for consumers.\n\nFake \u201cOrganic\u201d Food From China is FLOODING Store Shelves.
