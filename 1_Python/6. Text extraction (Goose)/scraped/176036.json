Fundamental Rights are being violated.\n\nThe substance of the EU procedures concerning the vaccine passport are contained in the EU EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM. (summary below, scroll down for Selected Excerpts and Complete Text).\n\nRegulation (EU) 2021/953 on the EU Digital COVID Certificate introduced EU-wide rules for issuing and accepting proof of a person\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination, test result or recovery.\n\nThe EU Digital COVID Certificate helps people travel freely within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic. How the certificate is used for other purposes (access to events, etc.) is up to each EU country to decide.\n\nThe Regulation currently applies until 30 June 2022. This initiative proposes to extend it by 12 months. (emphasis added)Commission adoption.\n\nThe MEMORANDUM outlined by the EU points to the derogation of fundamental human rights entrenched in the adoption of the EU Digital COVID Certificate Framework.\n\nAs noted in the above Summary, the intent is to extend the Regulation which expires on June 30 2022 for another twelve months until June 30th, 2023.\n\nThe EU Digital COVID Certificate Framework is slated to be tied into negotiations pertaining to a worldwide \u201cPandemic Treaty\u201d which were initiated in early March 2022.\n\n\u201ca green light to start negotiations on an international pandemic treaty\u2026 The Council adopted a decision to authorise the opening of negotiations for an international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.\u201d\n\nWhat is the timeline\n\nThe procedure is slated to be presented to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, \u201cwith the aim to adopt the instrument [namely the pandemic treaty] by 2024.\u201d\n\nThe object of the Pandemic Treaty consists in creating by 2024 a global health governance entity under WHO auspices.\n\nIn turn the Pandemic Treaty would be tied into the WHO\u2019s QR Verification Code project, which is intent upon creating a global digital data bank of 7.9 billion people. Both initiatives are to be carried out concurrently by the WHO in liaison with ID2020 and the Gavi Alliance, both of which are funded by the Gates Foundation.\n\n\u201can all-electronic ID \u2013 linking everything to everything of each individual (records of health, banking, personal and private, etc.).\u201d\n\n\u201cA worldwide digital ID system is in the making. [The aim] of the WEF\u2014and of all the central banks [is] to implement a global system in which everyone\u2019s personal data will be incorporated into the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) network.\u201d\n\nA Worldwide QR Verification Code lays the groundwork for the instatement of \u201ca Global Police State\u201d controlled by the financial establishment. It\u2019s part of what the late David Rockefeller entitled \u201cThe March towards World Government\u201d based on an alliance of bankers and intellectuals.\n\nWhat is the legitimacy as well as the science behind this diabolical project?\n\nNONE. Amply confirmed: THERE IS NO PANDEMIC. The alleged Covid-19 Pandemic is based on \u201cFake Science\u201d. Both the EU Digital COVID Certificate Framework as well as the WHO QR Verification Code are based on outrights lies and fabrications. It is now well established that the PCR test which has been used to \u201cdetect SARS-CoV-2\u201d is totally invalid.\n\n\u201cBoth the WHO and the CDC (with the usual innuendos) have confirmed what was known from the very outset in January 2020, namely that the RT-PCR test used to justify every single policy mandate including lockdowns, social distancing, the mask, confinement of the labor force, closure of economic activity, etc. was flawed and invalid\u201d\n\nThe EU Memorandum (below) confirms two types of tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 both of which have been declared invalid:\n\n1. According to Regulation (EU) 2021/953, test certificates are to be issued based on two types of tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely molecular nucleic acid amplification tests (\u2018NAAT\u2019), including those using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (\u2018RT-PCR\u2019), and rapid antigen tests, which rely on detection of viral proteins (antigens) using a lateral flow immunoassay that gives results in less than 30 minutes, provided they are carried out by health professionals or by skilled testing personnel. (emphasis added)\n\nThe legitimacy of the EU Digital Covid Certification Framework, the Pandemic Treaty and the QR Verification Code rests on the presumption that the alleged \u201cCovid-19 Pandemic is Real\u201d and that the \u201cmRNA Covid-19 vaccine constitutes a SOLUTION to the alleged Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe CDC confirms that the PCR test does not effectively differentiate between \u201cSARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses\u201d. As of 31 December 2021, the CDC has declared the PCR test as invalid.\n\nSustained by media disinformation and government propaganda, the mRNA vaccine was put forth as a solution to curbing the pandemic and saving lives.\n\nThe Vaccine does not Save Lives\n\nAmply documented, the Vaccine has triggered from the outset in December 2020 an upward trend in mortality and morbidity.\n\nExtending the Vaccine in the EU as outlined in the \u201cMemorandum\u201d is a crime against humanity. The EU Memorandum must be immediately suspended.\n\nVideo: In many countries, there was a significant shift in mortality following the introduction of the mRNA vaccine\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming. The latest official figures point to approximately:\n\n65,629 Covid-19 injection related deaths and 10,439,642 injuries reported as at 24 February 2022. for the EU, US and UK combined.\n\nBut only a small fraction of the victims or families of the deceased will go through the tedious process of reporting vaccine-related deaths and adverse events to the national health authorities.\n\nThe following statement contained in the EU Memorandum is nonsensical:\n\n\u201cIncreasing vaccine uptake remains a crucial objective in the fight against the pandemic, given the protection against hospitalisation and severe disease afforded by vaccination\n\nAmply documented, it\u2019s the Covid-19 mRNA \u201cVaccine\u201d rather than the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is \u201cthe killer\u201d.\n\nIn the words of Doctors for Covid Ethics:\n\n\u201cThe signal of harm is now indisputably overwhelming, and, in line with universally accepted ethical standards for clinical trials, Doctors for Covid Ethics demands that the COVID-19 \u201cvaccination\u201d programme be halted immediately worldwide.\n\nContinuation of the programme, in the full knowledge of ongoing serious harm and death to both adults and children, constitutes Crimes Against Humanity/Genocide, for which those found to be responsible or complicit will ultimately be held personally liable.\u201d\n\nThe Procedures described in the EU Memorandum should be immediately suspended. The Justification for a \u201cPandemic Treaty\u201d is Based on Lies and \u201cFake Science\u201d.\n\nThe 2020-22 Worldwide Corona Crisis: Destroying Civil Society, Engineered Economic Depression, Global Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat and the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["World News", "Latest"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Impact of COVID Vaccinations on Mortality\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSrc_s2Gqfw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSrc_s2Gqfw?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/03/council-gives-green-light-to-start-negotiations-on-international-pandemic-treaty/", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code.jpg", "https://id2020.org/alliance", "https://www.gavi.org/", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/canada-our-home-native-dictatorship/5772052", "https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc.htm", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/biggest-lie-in-world-history-the-data-base-is-flawed-there-never-was-a-pandemic-the-covid-mandates-including-the-vaccine-are-invalid/5772008", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/biggest-lie-in-world-history-the-data-base-is-flawed-there-never-was-a-pandemic-the-covid-mandates-including-the-vaccine-are-invalid/5772008", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/biggest-lie-in-world-history-the-data-base-is-flawed-there-never-was-a-pandemic-the-covid-mandates-including-the-vaccine-are-invalid/5772008", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/biggest-lie-in-world-history-the-data-base-is-flawed-there-never-was-a-pandemic-the-covid-mandates-including-the-vaccine-are-invalid/5772008", "https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/jaccuse-governments-worldwide-lying-you-people-populations-they-purportedly-serve/5750650", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/jaccuse-governments-worldwide-lying-you-people-populations-they-purportedly-serve/5750650", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-2020-worldwide-corona-crisis-destroying-civil-society-engineered-economic-depression-global-coup-detat-and-the-great-reset/5730652", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/mandatory-vaccination-eu-just-went-through-under-radar/5776115"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
