Wait. What? \u00ab Jon Rappoport's Blog", "cleaned_text": "The pressure is building. \u201cTake the vaccine.\u201d\n\nMany people are looking for a successful way to refuse the COVID vaccine in situations where the shots are mandated. I fully support such efforts.\n\nSome people believe they can make the argument that the FDA didn\u2019t actually give full approval to the Pfizer vaccine on August 23rd. Therefore, these people can refuse the vaccine on the grounds that it is still experimental, meaning it has only been granted Emergency Use Authorization.\n\nI\u2019ll discuss that practical strategy later in this article.\n\nBut first, I need to analyze the claim that the FDA didn\u2019t truly approve (license) the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nOK. Here we go.\n\nThe first FDA document I\u2019ll reference is \u201cComirnaty and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine,\u201d dated August 23, 2021. The document opens with this statement:\n\n\u201cOn August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and will now be marketed as Comirnaty, for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older. The vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), including for individuals 12 through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FDA approved\u201d means full approval. The FDA has fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine.\n\nAnd this vaccine \u201cwill now be marketed\u201d as the Comirnaty vaccine.\n\nThey are the same vaccine, medically speaking. The ingredients are the same.\n\nThe FDA document ALSO says the vaccine will continue to be available under the prior Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), for uses that are not yet fully approved. For example, injecting children 12-15, and as a third dose for certain immunocompromised people.\n\nThe full approval and the EUA status are riding together, side by side. The EUA status covers uses of the vaccine not covered under full approval.\n\nThe rest of this FDA document offers links. One of the links leads to an FDA news release, dated August 23, titled, \u201cFDA Approves First COVID-19 Vaccine.\u201d The release states:\n\n\u201cToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and will now be marketed as Comirnaty\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cTo support the FDA\u2019s approval decision today, the FDA reviewed updated data from the clinical trial which supported the EUA and included a longer duration of follow-up in a larger clinical trial population.\u201d\n\nThe FDA, in this news release, is again asserting that the Pfizer vaccine is now approved, and makes a clear distinction between the prior EUA and this new approval.\n\nNext, we move to a letter, also dated August 23, sent from the FDA to BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, and Pfizer Inc. The letter is marked, \u201cBLA Approval.\u201d BLA stands for \u201cBiologics License Application.\u201d Here are key quotes:\n\n\u201cPlease refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) submitted and received on May 18, 2021, under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) for COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are issuing Department of Health and Human Services U.S. License No. 2229 to BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, Mainz, Germany\u2026Under this license, you are authorized to manufacture the product, COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA\u2026You may label your product with the proprietary name, COMIRNATY\u2026\u201d\n\nThe FDA officially licensed this vaccine. This is approval. It is not merely a continuation of Emergency Use Authorization (EAU).\n\nAnd now we come to another key FDA document, a letter sent to Pfizer Inc. on August 23, 2021 (addressed to Ms. Elisa Harkins). It also mentions the full licensure (approval) of the vaccine:\n\n\u201cOn August 23, 2021, FDA approved the biologics license application (BLA) submitted by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH for COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 16 years of age and older.\u201d\n\nThis letter is further acknowledgement that the vaccine has been fully approved.\n\nNow we enter the thick weeds of the letter, during a discussion of how Emergency Use Authorization will continue to be used. The language is very dense. It\u2019s taken me a while to separate out the strands.\n\nTo help you with what I\u2019m going to untangle, understand that the FDA is making a distinction between what we could call the \u201cold Pfizer vaccine\u201d and the \u201cnew Pfizer vaccine.\u201d They are identical in their ingredients. They are the same vaccine. But the \u201cold vaccine\u201d vials were granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) before the August 23rd FDA full licensure of the vaccine; and the \u201cnew vaccine\u201d vials will certainly be used under full licensure (approval).\n\nSplitting hairs? Yes. But in order to understand what the FDA is saying in this letter, you have to grasp the distinction between \u201cthe old\u201d and \u201cthe new.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cold\u201d vaccine is labeled \u201cPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d vaccine is labeled \u201cCOMIRNATY.\u201d Again, they are exactly the same vaccine.\n\nThe FDA letter to Pfizer (the one addressed to Ms. Elisa Harkins) states:\n\n\u201cOn August 23, 2021, having concluded that revising this EUA [Emergency Use Authorization for the vaccine] is appropriate to protect the public health or safety\u2026FDA is reissuing the August 12, 2021 letter of authorization in its entirety with revisions incorporated to clarify that the EUA will remain in place for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for the previously-authorized indication and uses, and to authorize use of COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) under this EUA for certain uses that are not included in the approved BLA.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\nThe \u201cold vaccine\u201d will continue to have EUA status: it can be injected in people 12 and older, and it can be used as a third dose for certain immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe \u201cnew vaccine\u201d\u2014which has full FDA approval\u2014CONTINUES TO ALSO HAVE EUA STATUS\u2014and therefore it too can be injected in people 12 and older, and used as a third dose for certain immunocompromised individuals.\n\nStrange? Yes. The \u201cnew\u201d and fully approved vaccine retains its former EUA status. It\u2019s BOTH fully approved and certified as an emergency experimental product.\n\nI believe the FDA reasoning goes this way: the agency wants to make sure vials carrying the label of the \u201cnew\u201d fully approved vaccine can be injected into people to whom the full approval doesn\u2019t apply\u2014people between 12 and 15, and certain immunocompromised people, as a third shot. In other words, people covered under EUA status.\n\nIf you continue to read this FDA letter, you\u2019ll see this reasoning spelled out.\n\nBottom line, and my conclusion: The FDA has fully approved the \u201cnew vaccine\u201d AND it has also retained the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the \u201cnew vaccine.\u201d Both.\n\n\u2014So what does all this mean for people who want to find a workable reason for refusing the vaccine?\n\nFor example, suppose you work for a major corporation or a government agency, and you\u2019re told you must get the shot. You say, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t take the shot, because the FDA never approved it. It\u2019s still an experimental medicine, because it only has EUA status.\u201d\n\nI believe you\u2019ll lose. You\u2019ll be told, \u201cThe FDA HAS approved it.\u201d\n\nSuppose you take a somewhat different approach. You say, \u201cI\u2019ll need to see the actual vial containing the vaccine you want to inject me with. Is it labeled \u2018Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine\u2019 (the \u2018old\u2019 vaccine) or \u2018COMIRNATY\u2019 (the \u2018new\u2019 vaccine)?\u201d\n\nYour boss says, \u201cWhat difference does it make? Either way, it\u2019s the same vaccine.\u201d\n\nAnd you say, \u201cNot legally speaking. I understand it may take some time for the new shipments of the COMIRNATY to arrive. I won\u2019t take the Pfizer-BioNTech shot because it only has Emergency Use Status, and therefore it\u2019s an experimental medicine. Under federal law, I have the right to refuse an experimental medicine. I\u2019m invoking that right.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m giving you non-lawyer opinions here. Understand this.\n\nIt\u2019s possible this approach could buy you time. Maybe your boss will suddenly become a bit nervous\u2014he tells you he\u2019s going to talk to his company/agency attorneys, and he\u2019ll get back to you.\n\nOr maybe he threatens to fire you on the spot, and he tells you to hire (and pay through the nose for) a lawyer. You do. Do you think your argument will stand up in court? I don\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019d like to be wrong about that.\n\nMaybe your lawyer will suggest other approaches. A religious exemption, for example. Or, depending on the circumstances, a medical exemption.\n\nBut after reading the FDA documents I\u2019ve cited above, I say that if you think the FDA hasn\u2019t actually approved the vaccine, you\u2019re mistaken.\n\nThis country, and other countries, are being split into the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. Communities are dividing. Families are dividing and fracturing. It isn\u2019t a pretty picture.\n\nHere in America, we\u2019re used to living life as usual and believing that coercion isn\u2019t going to come to our front doors. Despite the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the vast financial destruction of the past year, many people still think things are \u201call right.\u201d\n\nI support all legal efforts to keep freedom of choice alive. I support the unions that are demanding NO VACCINE MANDATES. I also support those governors who are defending their states against COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates. People who criticize these governors because they aren\u2019t perfect or are partially compromised are barking up the wrong tree. We need all the help we can get.\n\nHowever, as far I\u2019m concerned, putting all our eggs in the basket of court cases, legal filings, unions, and governors is shortsighted, to say the least.\n\nFreedom always needs more. Freedom needs brave business owners to stay open and maskless, despite government edicts. Freedom needs parents to keep showing up at school board meetings, to demand an end to COVID restrictions and mandates.\n\nMost of all, freedom needs patriots, in the best sense of the word, to do what people in Europe and Australia are doing: come out in the street in great numbers. Over and over.\n\nNot by the thousands. By the millions.\n\nFor as long as it takes.\n\nThe enemies of freedom have to feel the heat. They have to see that the people can\u2019t be forced beyond a certain point.\n\nWhether we like it or not, whether we know it or not, the day is coming when, not the minority, but the majority of us will know we are living under tyranny.\n\nWe will know it in ways that are undeniable.\n\nSome of us already know it.\n\nWe\u2019re all living through a test of faith. Each individual; and whatever he/she has faith IN. How deep is that faith?
