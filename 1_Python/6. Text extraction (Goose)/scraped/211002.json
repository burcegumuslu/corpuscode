Their findings were published in the Journal of Medicinal Plants Research.\n\u2022 Medicinal plants are widely used for the treatment of diseases, including malaria, in Ghanaian Traditional Medicine.\n\u2022 To find new sources of drugs, the researchers collected data about Ghanaian traditional plant medicines from 36 herbalists registered with the Ghana Federation of Traditional and Alternative Medicine (GHAFTRAM).\n\u2022 They used a well-structured questionnaire to facilitate data collection. Only answers from willing respondents were documented.\n\u2022 The researchers identified 42 different plant species belonging to 27 families as commonly used medicines by GHAFTRAM herbalists for malaria.\n\u2022 Among these plants, the use of the leaves was the most reported (41 percent), and all medicinal preparations were decoctions made by boiling plant parts.\n\u2022 About 93 percent of the interviewed herbalists collect plants from the wild, with 7 percent of those plants coming from their immediate surroundings (within 100 m of their homes).\n\u2022 Major threats to the availability of medicinal plants \u2014 as enumerated by the respondents \u2014 were farming activities (40 percent), bushfires (33 percent), over-harvesting (14 percent) and drought (13 percent).\n\u2022 Most of the herbalists (56 percent) reported uprooting whole plants when collecting medicinal plant parts.\n\nAccording to the researchers, their data suggest a need for conservation and sustainable harvesting strategies to conserve plant wealth in Ghana.\n\nRead the full study at this link.\n\nTonny A-A, Heron RB, Susana OM, Mary-Ann A, Frederick A, Alexis CS, Peter A-AJ, Daniel B, Jerry A-L, Alfred AA.
