This infectious disease is usually called \u201cthe flu.\u201d\n\nFlu symptoms often include chills, cough, and fever. Once infected, the incubation period for flu is at least one to four days.\n\nInfluenza is contagious, and patients may experience its symptoms for seven to 14 days. The flu may spread via both direct (e.g. person to person by airborne droplets produced when sneezing or coughing) and indirect contact (e.g. when coming into contact with contaminated droplets on various surfaces).\n\nThere are three types of influenza viruses:\n\nInfluenza A and influenza B usually cause epidemics of respiratory illness that happen every winter. These epidemics are often linked with high hospitalization and death rates.\n\nInfluenza type C is different from the first two types because it causes either a very mild respiratory illness or a patient will have no symptoms at all. It doesn\u2019t cause epidemics like influenza types A and B. The majority of efforts to control the impact of influenza are directed at types A and B.\n\nThe side effects of influenza usually include:\n\u2022 Fever or feeling feverish/chills \u2014 Note that not all patients will have a fever.\n\u2022 Vomiting and diarrhea \u2014 This symptom is more common in children than in adults.\n\nMost cases of influenza are not serious. However, these individuals may experience severe complications due to the flu:\n\u2022 Patients with longstanding diseases that weaken the immune system\n\nInfluenza may cause complications such as:\n\u2022 Sinus problems and ear infections \u2014 Usually occurs among children.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent influenza\n\nThe following foods or nutrients can help prevent influenza and they can help you recover if you already have the flu:\n\u2022 Broccoli \u2014 Broccoli is chock-full of nutrients that your body will need when you have the flu. A single serving contains vitamins C and E that can boost your immune system. Broccoli also has calcium and fiber.\n\u2022 Chicken soup \u2014 Homemade chicken soup combines soothing broth and other nutritious ingredients. Chicken contains iron and protein. Additionally, chicken soup has carrots, celery, and herbs that contain various nutrients. Just make sure your chicken soup has little to no salt.\n\u2022 Fruits with vitamin C \u2014 Vitamin C is a crucial nutrient that will make your immune system stronger. Sources include citrus fruits, tomatoes, and strawberries.\n\u2022 Leafy greens \u2014 Sources include kale and spinach. These vegetables can also make your immune system stronger when you have the flu because they contain both vitamin C and vitamin E.\n\u2022 Yogurt \u2014 Yogurt with live cultures and protein can help soothe a sore throat. Additionally, yogurt can strengthen the immune system. Buy whole yogurts without added sugars.\n\nSince influenza is caused by a virus, antibiotics cannot treat it. If the flu has resulted in another illness caused by bacteria, antivirals may be prescribed in some cases.\n\nPatients with the flu should:\n\u2022 Avoid contact with other people whenever possible.\n\u2022 The patient is frail or elderly.\n\u2022 The patient\u2019s temperature remains high after four to five days.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Influenza Vaccine Facts They Don\u2019t Want You to Know!\n\nInfluenza is caused by viruses that infect the respiratory tract.
