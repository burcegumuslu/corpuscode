Pass Me the Cup of Hemlock!", "cleaned_text": "After my wife carefully read Prof. Chossudovsky\u2018s startling article \u201cBig Pharma Conglomerate with a Criminal Record: Pfizer \u2018Takes Over\u2019 EU Vaccine Market\u201d in \u201cGlobal Research\u201d (1), she said,\n\n\u201cSo we citizens are paying for the poison Big Pharma wants to inject us with.\u201d\n\nIndeed, because of the relentless fear campaign of an unscrupulous \u201celite\u201d, out of negligent ignorance or out of an incomprehensible good faith towards Big Pharma, we EU citizens are allowing this pharmaceutical conglomerate to inject us with a killer \u201cvaccine\u201d. This is similar to the ancient drink of poisonous \u201cspotted hemlock\u201d used in executions and voluntary suicides in Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC.\n\nAccording to Prof. Chossudovsky\u2019s thorough research, the European Commission is currently negotiating a contract with the pharmaceutical conglomerate Pfizer for the production of 1.8 billion mRNA vaccine doses \u2013 the largest vaccine project in world history. With this, every single person in the European Union is to be vaccinated four times within two years (2021 to 2021).\n\nBut Pfizer\u2019s mRNA \u2013 as well as those of its competitors including Astrazeneca, Moderna and J & J \u2013 are illegal drugs. That is, they are classified as \u201cunapproved\u201d and \u201cexperimental products\u201d in the US. So it is blatantly illegal to market an \u201cunapproved product\u201d. In addition, the \u201cvaccine\u201d project is flushing $41 billion into Big Pharma\u2019s coffers and there will be no return to the \u201cNew Normal\u201d after the \u201cvaccination\u201d.\n\nRegarding the \u201creliability\u201d of the EU partner Pfizer (von der Leyen), Chossudovsky recalls a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d that the EU does not want to open:\n\nPfizer, he said, was a \u201chabitual offender\u201d with a criminal record in the US and was indicted by the US Department of Justice in 2009 for \u201cdeceptive marketing\u201d. Pfizer pleaded guilty and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement. Also to be recalled are the many deaths and injuries caused by the \u201cexperimental vaccine\u201d mRNA.\n\nSufficiently documented: The vaccine is not required. There is no pandemic!\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Chossudovsky concludes, \u201cshould the EU Commission buy 1.8 billion doses of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA \u2018vaccine\u2019, which is known from the outset to have caused deaths and injuries, including autoimmune reactions, blood clotting abnormalities, stroke or internal bleeding?\u201d Next, Chossudovsky demands:\n\nDr Rudolf H\u00e4nsel is a graduate psychologist and educationalist. He is a frequent contributor to Global Research.\n\nOn April 14, 2021, the President of the European Commission confirmed that Brussels is negotiating a contract with Pfizer for the production of 1.8 billion mRNA vaccine doses.\n\nThis astronomical figure represents 23 percent of the World\u2019s population. It is exactly four times the population of the 27 member states of the European Union (448 Million, 2020 data).\n\nThis is the largest vaccine project in World history which is accompanied by the imposition of a diabolical \u201cTimeline\u201d on the people of the European Union consisting of recurrent mRNA inoculations over \u201cthe next two years and beyond\u201d.\n\nThe entire process will be coupled with a relentless fear campaign and the embedded ID vaccine passport, approved by the European Parliament barely a few weeks prior to the EU\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe EU Digital Vaccine Passport to be implemented by Pfizer BioNTech is part of theinfamous ID2020 project sponsored by Bill Gates\u2019 Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) \u201cwhich uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity\u201c.\n\nIf this EU contract with Pfizer extending into 2023 were to be carried out as planned, every single person in the European Union would be vaccinated four times over a two year period (2021-2023).\n\nAnd bear in mind, at the time of writing, Pfizer\u2019s mRNA (as well as those of its competitors including Astrazeneka, Moderna and J & J) are legally categorized (in the US) as \u201cunapproved\u201d and \u201cexperimental products\u201d. They are illegal drugs.\n\nIn the US, the FDA in its ambiguous statement provided a so-called Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, namely \u201cto permit the emergency use of the unapproved product, \u2026 for active immunization\u2026\u201d (see below)\n\nI have checked this statement with a prominent lawyer. It is blatantly illegal to market an \u201cunapproved product\u201d (irrespective of government permissions pertaining thereto).\n\nCoinciding with the EU April 14, 2021 historic decision, Pfizer has announced that the price of its vaccine has been hiked up to $23 a dose.\n\nBig Money for Big Pharma. The 1.8 billion doses vaccine project will cost 41 billion dollars, largely to be financed by the creditors of EU member states. The vaccine project will thereby contribute to the spiralling public debt crisis affecting most European countries, which was triggered by the closure of economic activity and the lockdowns in the course of last 13 months.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer has extended its global market largely to the detriment of its competitors.\n\u2022 A contract to supply the US with up to 600 million doses,\n\nThe Medium Term: 2021-2023 and \u201cBeyond\u201d. No Return to the \u201cNew Normal\u201d once Vaccinated\n\nWhat is envisaged in the EU is a so-called \u201cmedium term\u201d plan extending into 2022/23. Does this \u201cmedium term\u201d timeline imply a fourth and a fifth wave?\n\nThe \u201cmedium term\u201d project will be carried out in liaison with the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d proposed by the World Economic Forum. It will most probably be accompanied by lockdown and other restrictive measures. No foreseeable return to the \u201cNew Normal\u201d is contemplated:\n\nBut let me [President of EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen] also focus on the medium term. ... It is clear that to defeat the virus decisively, we will need to be prepared for the following: \u2026 we might need booster jabs to reinforce and prolong immunity; \u2026 we will need to develop vaccines that are adapted to new variants; and we will need them early and in sufficient quantities. Having this in mind we need to focus on technologies that have proven their worth. mRNA vaccines are a clear case in point.\n\nBased on all this, we are now entering into a negotiation with BioNTech-Pfizer for a third contract. This contract will foresee the delivery of 1.8 billion doses of vaccine over the period of 2021 to 2023. And it will entail that not only the production of the vaccines, but also all essential components, will be based in the EU.\n\nThe negotiations we are launching today [April 14, 2021]\u2013 and hope to conclude very rapidly \u2013 are a further important step in Europe\u2019s response to the pandemic.\n\nI want to thank BioNTech-Pfizer. It has proven to be a reliable partner. It has delivered on its commitments, and it is responsive to our needs. This is to the immediate benefit of EU citizens. ( President of EU Commission)\n\nThere is another dimension, a \u201ccan of worms\u201d which the EU does not want to open. The largest vaccine project of an \u201cunapproved drug\u201d is to be implemented by a Big Pharma company which has a longstanding record of bribing medical doctors and public health officials.\n\nPfizer has been a \u201chabitual offender,\u201d persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results. Since 2002 the company and its subsidiaries have been assessed $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards. (Dr Robert G. Evans, National Institutes of Medicine)\n\nMoreover, Pfizer has a criminal record in the US, indicted by the US Department of Justice in 2009 for \u201cfraudulent marketing\u201d.\n\n\u201cPfizer, the world\u2019s largest drugs company, has been hit with the biggest criminal fine in US history as part of a $2.3bn settlement with federal prosecutors for mispromoting medicines and for paying kickbacks to compliant doctors.\u201d(Guardian)\n\nIn a historic US Department of Justice decision in September 2009, Pfizer Inc. pleaded guilty to criminal charges. It was \u201cThe Largest Health Care Fraud Settlement\u201d in the History of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHow on Earth can you trust a Big Pharma vaccine conglomerate which pleaded guilty to criminal charges by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) including \u201cfraudulent marketing\u201d and \u201cfelony violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act\u201d?\n\nIn this 2009 DOJ Judgment, Pfizer was so to speak \u201cPut on Probation\u201d for a four year period. Pfizer was ordered to enter into \u201ca corporate integrity agreement\u201d with the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), acting as a de facto \u201cParole Officer\u201d. \u201cThat agreement provided for \u201cprocedures and reviews to \u2026 avoid and promptly detect\u201d (future) misconduct on the part of Pfizer, Inc.\n\nCorporate Integrity? Pfizer BioNTech\u2019s \u201cFraudulent Marketing\u201d behaviour prevails with regard to the projected 1.8 billion doses of its \u201cunapproved\u201d \u201cexperimental\u201d mRNA COVID\u201119 Tozinameran \u201cvaccine\u201d, sold under the brand name Comirnaty.\n\nWhat we are dealing with is the \u201cfraudulent marketing\u201d of what is best described as a killer \u201cvaccine\u201d.\n\nBut in fact, the mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d which modifies the human genome \u201cis NOT\u201d a vaccine. It is based on gene therapy combined with an embedded ID vaccine passport.\n\nDeaths and Injuries Resulting From the MRNA \u201cExperimental Vaccine\u201d\n\nIs the European Commission intent on edging out Astrazeneka and J & J (on behalf of Pfizer??). Official statements suggest that Pfizer BioNTech will eventually be taking over the entire EU vaccine market.\n\nIn early March 2o21, 18 European countries including France, Italy, Germany and Spain decided to suspend the AstraZeneka mRNA vaccine. Astrazeneka was the target of national EU governments, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as the EU Commission.\n\nThe EU has now confirmed that it will not renew its contracts with J and J and AstraZeneka despite the fact (according to EU and UK data) that the deaths and injuries resulting from the Pfizer BioNTech \u201cvaccine\u201d are much higher than those of AstraZeneka.\n\nOfficial EU data pertaining to vaccine deaths and injuries for Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca point to: 3,964 Dead and 162,610 Injuries (December 27, 2020 \u2013 March 13, 2021)\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental vaccine AZD1222(CHADOX1 NCOV-19) from Oxford/AstraZeneca: 451 deaths and 54,571 injuries to 13/03/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (code BNT162b2, Comirnaty) from Pfizer: 2,540 deaths and 102,100 injuries to 13/03/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273 (CX-024414) from Moderna: 973 deaths and 5,939 injuries to 13/03/2021\n\nUK data also confirms that the so-called side effects of the mRNA are significantly higher for the Pfizer BioNTech \u201cvaccine\u201d (in comparison with AstraZeneka). See British Government Shocking Report on Side Effects of Corona Vaccines: Strokes, Blindness, Miscarriages\n\nSo why are Pfizer\u2019s competitors, namely Astrazeneka and J & J being shoved out of the EU market?\n\nThere is War within Big Pharma.\n\nAmply documented, the vaccine is not required. There is no pandemic.\n\nAnd why would the EU Commission representing 450 million people in 27 countries commit itself to purchasing 1.8 billion doses of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA Tozinameran\u201dvaccine\u201d which at the very outset is known to have resulted in countless deaths and injuries including autoimmune reactions. blood clotting abnormalities, stroke and internal bleeding?\n\nWho is behind this despicable project??\n\nSee the Rebuttal of Doctors for Covid Ethics addressed to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nSay NO to the Killer Virus. The EU sponsored Pfizer \u201cvaccine\u201d must be the object of a coordinated grassroots movement in all 27 member states of the European Union, as well as Worldwide.\n\nThe scientific evidence amply confirms that a Covid-19 vaccine is NOT required. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe estimates of so-called covid-19 positive cases are based on the RT-PCR test which according to the WHO\u2019s latest statement (January 20, 2021) is totally unreliable and which has served to hike up the numbers, while also justifying the need for a mRNA vaccine, which in effect is not a vaccine.\n\nWhile the media will highlight the \u201cKiller virus\u201d, with scanty and contradictory \u201cevidence\u201d, what is at stake is best described as \u201ca killer vaccine\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the estimates of Covid deaths used to justify the need for a vaccine are fake. In the US, certifiers have been instructed to indicate the \u201cunderlying cause of death\u201d as Covid-19 \u201cmore often than not\u201d.\n\u2022 How to Mislead Humanity and Lock Down Society Using COVID-19 RT-PCR Tests\n\u2022 A Global Team of Experts has found 10 Fatal Flaws in the Main Test for Covid\n\u2022 Big Pharma\u2019s Most Corrupt Company Plans to Corner the COVID-19 Market\n\nWhen we see our public officials gleefully allowing themselves to be inoculated with the latest mRNA vaccines based on a fake pandemic, we know that we are being managed and ruled by idiocy. Some actions on our part are required.\n\nYou can actually participate in the global efforts to cripple the Deep State organized criminal cabal's ability for genocide, while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same time, by boycotting Big Pharma for good.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Do You Want to Finance a Killer \u201cVaccine\u201d and be \u201cInoculated\u201d with It?
