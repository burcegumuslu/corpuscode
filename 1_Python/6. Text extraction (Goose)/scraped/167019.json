The babies died between one and 11 days after the vaccination.\n\n \n\n Friday 06 November 2009\n\n\n\n AMSTERDAM \u2013 Dutch authorities say they have banned use of a batch of Pfizer\u2019s Prevenar, or Prevnar, after three infants died within two weeks of receiving the anti-infection vaccination.\n\n\u201cOn average about 5 to 10 deaths are reported annually after babies get vaccines,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Dutch health institute RIVM.\n\n\u201cWe now have three cases in a short period, that is unusual and the reason for suspending the batch.\u201d\n\nShe said RIVM was investigating the cause of the infants\u2019 deaths. Other batches of Prevenar, known as Prevnar in the United States, will continue to be used.\n\nPfizer spokeswoman Gwen Fisher said preliminary investigations by the company and health authorities had found no link between the vaccinations and the deaths.\n\nShe said the company initiated the \u201cquarantine\u201d of the batch which she said contained 110,000 doses of Prevenar, used to prevent pneumonia and related infections.\n\nFisher said the three infants also received two unrelated other vaccines as part of routine immunizations.\n\nNo other Prevenar batches were suspended and infants in the Netherlands will continue to be vaccinated with it as part of routine immunization, she added.\n\nA spokesman for the European Medicines Agency in London said its officials were working with the Dutch authorities to find out if there were any safety issues with the vaccine batch.\n\nThe vaccine is one of the most widely used in the world and generated sales for U.S. drugmaker Wyeth of $2.7 billion in 2008.\n\nWyeth, which has just been acquired by U.S. rival Pfizer, had asked for the suspension of batch D66977 of Prevenar, RIVM said in a statement.\n\nOfficials at Pfizer in New York could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAnd today begins the the mass vaccination programme with the swine flu vaccine:\n\n\u2013 Dr. Gary Null Speaking Out at the NYS Assembly Hearing
