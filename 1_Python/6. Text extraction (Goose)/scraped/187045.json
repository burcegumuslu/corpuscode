These ominous warnings about cracking down on vaccine exemptions are a sure indication that the FDA, like other federal agencies, has grown too big for its britches. The rise of administrative power within the federal government has long been a threat to American freedom.\n\nApparently, Gottlieb has no concerns about violating Americans\u2019 right to freedom. No where in the Constitution does it give the federal government the right to mandate medical decisions for the American people \u2014 and yet, that is what the leader of the FDA is trying to do.\n\nAs many critics have noted, federal agencies like the FDA use their position as an \u201cadministrative\u201d agency to circumvent the Constitution \u2014 and all of the limitations it puts on the three official branches of federal government. Administrative agencies today now function as the \u201cfourth branch\u201d of federal government \u2014 with all of the power and none of the stipulations.\n\nWhile FDA officials say that their threats of \u201cintervention\u201d are to protect the public, what they aren\u2019t saying is that a power grab of this kind will set a dangerous precedent for the future. At the very least, it will establish federal agencies\u2019 ability to usurp state-held powers whenever they see fit.\n\nFDA Commissioner Gottlieb recently spoke with CNN, warning the people of the United States that low levels of vaccine compliance may lead to government \u201cintervention.\u201d\n\nThe power of the elements: Discover Colloidal Silver Mouthwash with quality, natural ingredients like Sangre de Drago sap, black walnut hulls, menthol crystals and more.

While Gottlieb\u2019s skepticism of vaccine exemptions can be turned into law \u2014 the skepticism of vaccine \u201csafety\u201d shared by millions of Americans is completely null.\n\nAs an unelected official, Gottlieb doesn\u2019t even really represent the American people. He\u2019s a bureaucrat \u2014 and whenever a bureaucrat is doing something to expand their power, We The People should be sharing some skepticism of our own.\n\nWithin federal agencies, corruption is a serious issue. Both the Office of Inspector General and the Committee on Government Reform have made the issue of conflicts of interest within federal agencies a known problem for decades.\n\nAs Natural News previously reported, the CDC and FDA often rely on external experts with financial ties to the pharma industry \u2014 and members of their advisory committees often own stock in vaccine companies. Both agencies have been criticized for failing to conduct meaningful research on the potential hazards of vaccines.\n\nThe problem of corruption, cronyism and conflict of interest within federal agencies is made worse by their unabridged power.\n\nAs Columbia Law Professor Philip Hamburger, author of the books The Administrative Threat and Is Administrative Law Unlawful?, posits:\n\nAdministrative power also evades many of the Constitution\u2019s procedures, including both its legislative and judicial processes. Administrative power thereby sidesteps most of the Constitution\u2019s procedural freedoms. Administrative power is thus all about the evasion of governance through law, including an evasion of constitutional processes and procedural rights.\n\nAs The New American reports, vaccine laws have always been a state issue \u2014 dating all the way back to a 1905 Supreme Court case. And this is where the true motive of mandatory vaccination lies. It\u2019s not about public health; it\u2019s about expanding federal power. Currently, states reserve the rate to make laws about things like vaccines, car insurance and the like.\n\nThis is because these powers are not explicitly laid out by the Constitution \u2014 which means the federal government is not entitled to have them.\n\nIf the Tenth Amendment were a person, it would be rolling in its grave right now.\n\nOnce the FDA has granted itself the right to usurp powers traditionally held by the states, there will be no turning back.\n\nSee more coverage of the latest vaccine tyranny at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "FDA threatens to demand nationwide vaccine compliance; ending all exemptions and forcing children to be vaccinated against their will", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2019-02-27-fda-threatens-to-demand-nationwide-vaccine-compliance-ending-all-exemptions.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is now threatening to overthrow state laws and institute federal vaccine mandates.
