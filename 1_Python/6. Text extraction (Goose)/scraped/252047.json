We don\u2019t know that they ever meet, and we don\u2019t have any records of their meetings,\u201d the Senator reiterated, adding \u201cIt\u2019s top-secret. Congress is not allowed to know. So whether the committee actually exists, we\u2019re uncertain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do know that they\u2019ve met three times and there are thousands of gain-of-function research proposals. They\u2019ve only met three times, they\u2019ve only reviewed three projects,\u201d Paul continued.\n\nThree scientists testified during the hearing, they were Dr. Richard Ebright, laboratory director of the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University, Kevin Esvelt, assistant professor of media arts and sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, and Dr. Steven Quay, CEO of Atossa Therapeutics Inc.\n\n\u201cThe three scientists agreed that this was dangerous research. Two of the three absolutely said it was gain-of-function. The third said it was dangerous research and should have gone before a committee,\u201d Paul asserted.\n\nThe Senator added that \u201cWhen Dr. Fauci said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve reviewed this and the experts have looked at this, and said it\u2019s not gain-of-function,\u2019 even that wasn\u2019t true. There was a committee that was formed after 2017 to look at this dangerous research. They didn\u2019t look at this research at all because they never reviewed it. So no one reviewed this to say it wasn\u2019t gain-of-function research. They didn\u2019t review it, period.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we learned a lot of things, but I think we reconfirmed that Dr. Fauci is not being honest with us,\u201d Paul urged, adding \u201cYes, the NIH funded gain-of-function research. Yes, it was dangerous. And yes, nobody looked over this. Nobody reviewed the research. Yes, a million people died. And there still seems to be a significant lack of curiosity on the part of Democrats.\u201d\n\nSenator Paul chaired the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing because no Democrats even bothered to show up.\n\nDuring the hearing, Dr. Ebright said that he stands by previous statements he has made charging that Anthony Fauci \u201clied to Congress, lied to the press, and lied to the public knowingly, willfully, brazenly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe statements made on repeated occasions to the public, the press, and to policymakers by the NIAID director, Dr. Fauci, have been untruthful,\u201d Ebright said, adding \u201cI do not understand why those statements are being made, because they are demonstrably false.\u201d\n\nDr. Esvelt warned that \u201cwe are so used to thinking of pandemics as a health and safety issue that we have missed the national security implications of identifying viruses that could be deliberately unleashed to kill millions of people.\u201d\n\nDr. Quay outlined how the idea that the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan wet market is highly unlikely, noting \u201cThere is no dispositive evidence the pandemic began as a spillover of a natural virus in a market,\u201d and further declaring \u201cAll evidence is consistent with a laboratory-acquired infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe virus has three genomic regions that have the signature of synthetic biology\u2014that is, gain-of-function research,\u201d Quay said in his opening statement, adding \u201cOne region has features of the two types of forbidden gain-of-function research that are associated with bioweapons development: asymptomatic transmission and immune-system evasion.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Rand Paul: Congress is not allowed to know about top secret gain of function research committee", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2022-08-05-congress-not-allowed-to-know-secret-research.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "Appearing on Fox News to discuss the first ever Senate hearing on gain of function research, Rand Paul revealed that there is a committee that is supposed to oversee such experimentation with potentially lethal viruses, but that it is above the oversight of Congress.
