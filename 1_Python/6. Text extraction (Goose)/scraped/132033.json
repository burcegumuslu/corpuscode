That is what we are building at DSruptive and our goal is to transform healthcare on a global scale.\u201d\n\nThe chip, which is roughly the size of a grain of rice, is capable of storing not just a person\u2019s covid injection passport but also private medical information and cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cImplants are a very versatile technology that can be used for many different things,\u201d Sjoblad explained in an earlier interview. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s very convenient to have covid passports always accessible on your implant.\u201d\n\nThe chip is designed to be implanted into a person\u2019s arm or hand, though it can probably go anywhere a person prefers. It measures two millimeters by 16 mm in size.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m as pro-vaccine as anyone around \u2026 AND I\u2019m pro-vaccine passport (on a voluntary basis only), but this just plays into the narrative of \u2018they want to track you\u2019 conspiracy theorists,\u201d admitted one of Sjoblad\u2019s critics on Twitter.\n\nGetting microchipped means the system owns you\n\nMany household pets already have such chips implanted into their necks. This is how lost pets are commonly returned back to their owners, as the chips contain home addresses and other identification data.\n\nNow, the system wants to chip humans in much the same way. For just 100 euros, a person can have one of Sjoblad\u2019s chips embedded into the hand or arm (or forehead?) to prove injection status on demand.\n\nAll that is required is a mobile phone or some other kind of scanner to detect the chip. Then, any required information from it is instantly pulled up on a screen showing \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen scanned, a PDF will appear that shows all the details of the person\u2019s EU Digital Covid Certificate, which indicates their vaccination status and may also show whether the person has recently been tested positive for Covid,\u201d reports Express (U.K.).\n\nSjoblad says that the chip\u2019s design allows for \u201calways accessible\u201d information by \u201canyone else, really, who wants to read me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, if I go to the movies or go to a shopping center, then people will be able to check my status even if I don\u2019t have my phone,\u201d he added in the interview.\n\nWhile Sjoblad insists that his company\u2019s microchips are not tracking devices, he did admit that they are easily activated by external devices as simple as a smartphone.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a battery,\u201d he says about the chips. \u201cThey cannot transmit a signal by themselves. So they are basically passive. They sit there asleep.\u201d\n\nCommenters at Express gave an almost resounding no to the technology, saying they would never allow it inside their bodies no matter how \u201cpassive\u201d it supposedly is.\n\n\u201cNot a cat in hell\u2019s chance will I have that, or anything like it, implanted in me,\u201d one of them wrote.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t this also happen in 1939 in Europe with a tattoo gun?\u201d asked another.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s for your health\u2019 \u2013 oh dear, where have we heard that before?\u201d another wrote.\n\nMore of the latest news about covid vaccine microchips can be found at Prophecy.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Covid microchips are coming \u201cwhether we like it or not,\u201d warns developer", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2022-01-07-covid-microchips-coming-whether-like-it-not.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "Hannes Sjoblad is lashing out against critics who say that his company\u2019s new implantable microchips that track people\u2019s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccination status are \u201cinvasive.\u201d The director of DSruptive Subdermals, based in Sweden, told the public in a recent media interview that his company\u2019s chips are here now \u201cwhether we like it or not,\u201d and [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.glitch.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/01/Microscopic-Tiny-Computer-Microchip-1.jpg"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "Dsruptive Subdermals", "Satanic tech", "future science", "future tech", "COVID", "tracking", "Mark of the beast", "microchip", "Medical Tyranny", "medical extremism", "privacy watch", "surveillance", "Sweden", "freedom", "insanity", "vaccination"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1542866/covid-microchip-developer-rollout-vaccine-passport", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-26-mark-of-the-beast-microchip-implants-track-vaccination-status.html", "http://prophecy.news", "https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1542866/covid-microchip-developer-rollout-vaccine-passport", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-26-mark-of-the-beast-microchip-implants-track-vaccination-status.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fglitch%2F2022-01-07-covid-microchips-coming-whether-like-it-not.html&linkname=Covid%20microchips%20are%20coming%20%E2%80%9Cwhether%20we%20like%20it%20or%20not%2C%E2%80%9D%20warns%20developer", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
