Well, in May 2020, the federal government launched Operation Warp Speed, an unprecedented initiative allowing vaccine developers to perform certain tasks simultaneously, rather than sequentially. The aim was to accelerate vaccine development \"without curtailing the critical steps required by sound science and regulatory standards,\" according to an October 2020 editorial in \u200bThe New England Journal of Medicine\u200b\u200b.\u200b\n\nThe problem is that some people may not bother getting a second shot or presume they're done after the first dose. In the history of vaccines, \"anything that's been a two-shot vaccine has turned out to be a pain in the neck. People don't comply,\" Caplan pointed out during a media briefing on the topic.\n\nShe's been on the front lines of clinical trials of two different vaccines. Each uses messenger RNA (mRNA), an approach she likens to delivering a bit of computer code into a cell, instructing it to make spike protein (the type found on the surface of the novel coronavirus). When the body's immune system encounters the protein, it makes antibodies. It's teaching your immune system to recognize COVID, she says, so that when you encounter the virus, your immune system ramps up quickly.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "A COVID-19 vaccine has been developed in record time.
