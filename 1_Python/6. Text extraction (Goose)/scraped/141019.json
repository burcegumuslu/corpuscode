Sadly, too many are still stuck not only believing the myth of \u201cauthority\u201d but are caught up in the slave system so fully that they cannot even imagine not having a master.\n\nAccording to a report by CNN, the shocking implosion of Silicon Valley Bank should not deter the Federal Reserve from its war on inflation, according to former FDIC and Fed official Thomas Hoenig.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve is in the hot seat. It\u2019s a no-win situation for them,\u201d Hoenig, the former vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told CNN in a phone interview on Monday.\n\nAs Gregory Mannarino said that parading Joe Biden out to sell the public another lie about how strong the economy is, is going to do more harm than good.\n\n \n\n \u201cThis may wake up some people,\u201d Mannarino says. If the ruling class can \u201chit people in the pocketbook,\u201d they may begin to see the slave system for what it is. Or, they could beg their master to save them and the solution will be nothing short of permanent slavery. The illusion that there\u2019s any freedom at all in this system will be gone. \u201c[The central banks] are the enemy. They are public enemy number one,\u201d he added. They will stop at nothing to make sure humans are fully controlled tax cattle.\n\nRaising interest rates at the Fed\u2019s monetary policy meeting next week could add to the financial pressure facing the banking system, in part by further depressing the value of the bonds that banks are sitting on, CNN further reported. But Hoenig, who led the Kansas City Fed during the 2008 financial crisis, urged the Fed to keep hiking rates because inflation hasn\u2019t gone away.\n\n\u201cIt says to the world inflation is still the problem,\u201d said Hoenig, who is now a distinguished senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. \u201cGet inflation down. Then you can have a long period of stability, hopefully. If you don\u2019t get inflation down, you get a long period of instability.\u201d\n\nThe central banks are doing nothing but navigating an agenda that they\u2019ve had in place for over a century. The goal is a central bank digital currency or CBDC which they will use to make sure the slaves stay in line and have a hard time breaking free from.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is going to get a lot worse\u201d, said Mannarino in a video posted today.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-03-17 10:06:41", "title": "Central banking continues to fail", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-03-17-central-banking-continues-to-fail.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "The Federal Reserve, or the United States central bank, continues to show why totalitarian control over anything, especially a money supply, is little more than slavery.
