Cats are different from many animals, as they have extremely short digestive tracts, and are unable to digest fiber, which can help to promote a healthy digestive system. Therefore, probiotic supplements may sometimes be essential, particularly to reduce symptoms of diarrhea.\n\nWhat are Probiotics for Cats?\n\nProbiotics for cats are similar to probiotics for humans, in that they are intended to promote the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut and optimize digestive health. However, you shouldn\u2019t assume that human foods that contain probiotics are safe for cats, such as yogurt or sauerkraut. Instead, choose a cat food that includes probiotics, or purchase probiotics designed for the digestive tract of cats. [1]\n\nThe appropriate dosage for cats is between 10 and 40 billion CFU (colony-forming units). Cats can have small amounts of human probiotics, such as yogurt, but many cats are lactose intolerant, so species-specific probiotics are recommended. [2]\n\nThere are many benefits for cats who take probiotics, including:\n\nFor those cats who often experience constipation or vomiting, bolstering their gut with cat probiotics is a good choice. Similar to humans, a significant amount of the immune system operates out of the gut, so chronic disease and inflammation can be prevented. [3]\n\nHow to Give Probiotics to Cats?\n\u2022 As mentioned, the best way to give probiotics to cats is to include them in their treats or wet food, but hide them well, as the taste is not always pleasant.\n\u2022 You can also hold your cat\u2019s mouth open and encourage them to swallow the probiotic to ensure they consumed it.\n\u2022 Probiotic pastes can also be mixed into your cat\u2019s food.\n\u2022 The last resort is a probiotic injection, administered by your veterinarian.\n\nThe primary side effects of cat probiotics include a return to negative gastrointestinal symptoms once the use of probiotics is stopped. Furthermore, be sure to only use probiotics from trusted sources, as many products contain additives and filler that may not be beneficial for your pet\u2019s health.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Probiotics for Cats | Organic Facts", "description": "Probiotics for cats are similar to probiotics for humans.
