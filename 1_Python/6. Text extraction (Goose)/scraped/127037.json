Despite the lack of definitive proof, researchers believe that they can understand how Bigfoot behaves and communicates. It may even be possible to make contact and get the proof we need. Rhettman Mullis recounts tales of tracking this elusive creature and reveals how he may one day prove the existence of Bigfoot in this interview with George Noory.\n\nIn the summer of 1977, Rhettman A. Mullis Jr. saw his first Bigfoot swimming in the Puget Sound. That started his journey as a Bigfoot researcher. Over the next 36 years, he would continue to spend time studying accounts of Bigfoot. He currently heads, Bigfootology, which is a global team of scientists and field experts dedicated to the study of the global Bigfoot phenomenon using modern scientific technology, processes, and the multidisciplinary approach to research and problem solving.", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.gaia.com/video/proving-bigfoot-rhettman-mullis", "title": "Proving Bigfoot with Rhettman Mullis", "description": "Despite the lack of definitive proof, researchers believe that they", "image": "https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/ce11f75b-8f21-42de-add2-235f41377b3c/46296_BB_s3_e33_proving_bigfoot_16x9.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/ce11f75b-8f21-42de-add2-235f41377b3c/46296_BB_s3_e33_proving_bigfoot_16x9.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "576", "site_name": "Gaia"}, "tags": ["Watch On Demand"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
