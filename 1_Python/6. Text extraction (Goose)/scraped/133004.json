If you or someone you know has it, this isn\u2019t an overly surprising statement. According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, 59% of people who suffer from psoriasis report it\u2019s a concern that affects all aspects of everyday life, and 33% report the skin condition has a negative impact on their social life. More than half report dissatisfaction with treatment. [1] If you\u2019re seeking relief, new research shows ozonated olive oil may be an ideal natural remedy.\n\nScientists don\u2019t know the exact cause of psoriasis, but research indicates it\u2019s the result of an immune response from genetics. When it does appear, it\u2019s often because a medication, a food in your diet or the environment triggered it. Known triggers include stress, skin injury (like sunburn), vaccinations, scratches, and medications. Medicines known to trigger psoriasis include antimalarial drugs, lithium, quinidine, indomethacin (an NSAID taken for arthritis), and Inderal (a blood pressure med). Infections from an earache, strep, bronchitis, or other respiratory conditions can also cause a flare-up.\n\nWhat are the Different Types of Psoriasis?\n\nWhen triggered, psoriasis appears as one or more of these five conditions:\n\u2022 Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of dead cells that gives a scaly appearance and causes inflamed skin. It appears most often on the elbows, knees, lower back, and scalp.\n\u2022 Guttate psoriasis, the second most common type, shows blotchy red marks all over the torso and is often triggered by a strep infection, usually in young adults.\n\u2022 Pustular psoriasis consists of tiny white blisters or pustules surrounded by white skin most commonly occurring on the hands and feet. It\u2019s not contagious, nor is it an infection.\n\u2022 Inverse psoriasis appears under the arm, behind the knee, or in the groin area. It appears smooth, even shiny and is usually accompanied by another form of psoriasis in another area of the body.\n\u2022 Erythrodermic psoriasis is the most dangerous, and its symptoms include fiery redness that covers most if not all of the body. Due to the severity of this condition, you should go and see a doctor immediately if these symptoms describe you.\n\nScalp Psoriasis Help: Where to Start\n\nScalp psoriasis afflicts about 50% of those who suffer from psoriasis. It may occur as a mild scaling or a more severe crusting of the entire scalp, behind the ears, and onto the forehead. The process of healing this condition is fairly straightforward and breaks down into three steps \u2013 soften, remove, and alleviate.\n\nFirst, soften the scales. You\u2019ll need to apply a salve or lotion for this step. There are a number of over-the-counter options, although many people have found success with ozonated olive oil.\n\nOnce softened, the scales can be loosened with a brush or fine comb. To prevent irritation of your already inflamed skin, brush gently or hold the comb at an angle. Next, wash your hair with shampoo that contains salicylic acid.\n\nTo reduce the appearance, rub oils or lotions directly into your scalp. Other products may have different instructions for the best effect. If you have a severe case that doesn\u2019t respond to this, see your doctor as you may need a more involved treatment.\n\nFor years, olive oil mixtures have proven an effective remedy for irritated, reddened skin. [2] Ozonated olive oil increases the speed and effectiveness of recovery as it cleans and sterilizes your skin, acts as a moisturizing conditioner, and reduces swelling and redness. The ozone triggers the body to create enzymes that regulate skin growth and healing. [3]\n\nResearch suggests ozonated olive oil absorbs deep into your skin. It appears to calm nerves and reduce pain and approaches the condition at the cellular level, improving cellular function and cellular memory for a better overall healthy skin. For psoriasis sufferers, this could mean faster relief of red patches of itchy skin, inflammation, and scaling.\n\nAt Global Healing, we\u2019ve gotten exceptionally positive feedback about Global Healing's Skin Therapy.
