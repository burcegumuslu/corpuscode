After five long years of litigation, Health and Human Services (HHS), the Respondent in all vaccine injury cases, conceded that the varicella vaccination did in fact cause RD\u2019s vaccine injury, transverse myelitis, which has left him a tetraplegic.\n\nIn November 2014, HHS conceded that the vaccination caused RD\u2019s injuries. Even with this concession, his case continued for another year in the damages phase, during which time the parties continued to negotiate the amount of damages that RD would receive for his injuries. Although he was compensated for his suffering and injuries, the monetary award will never compensate for the lifelong effects this young man is suffering from his vaccine injury.\n\nRD was only 13 when his life changed forever. At a routine well-child visit in 2009, the doctor informed RD\u2019s parents that he was due to receive the hepatitis A and varicella vaccinations. His parents complied with the doctor\u2019s order and RD received the vaccinations.\n\nRD\u2019s mother explained that, at that time in RD\u2019s state, only one dose of varicella vaccine was required and RD had already received one dose of that vaccine. This second dose that was administered to RD at this well visit was determined to be the cause of RD\u2019s horrific injuries, and it was not even required for him, which his family didn\u2019t realize until it was too late.\n\nAbout 14 days later, RD began to experience excruciating pain shooting through his body along with tingling, numbness and paralysis of his limbs. After extensive testing and many invasive procedures, RD was diagnosed with transverse myelitis.\n\nRD\u2019s parents filed a case in Vaccine Court, which took over five years to settle. RD and his family faced arduous heartbreak along the way. In the ruling, a representative from the United States Department of Justice agreed that \u201ca preponderance of the evidence establishes that petitioner\u2019s transverse myelitis was caused-in-fact by the administration of his August 12, 2009 varicella vaccine.\u201d [1]\n\n\u201cThe injuries that RD suffered from this vaccine are severe and lifelong. Even though he has received a significant award as far as the awards in the Vaccine Court go, no amount of money will ever compensate him for what he has lost.\n\nBut RD is an amazing young man who has not let this injury stop him in any way. He has graduated high school with his class, attends a Tier 1 college, and has great aspirations that I know he will achieve despite the challenges he faces because of his injuries.\u201d\n\nTransverse myelitis is a rare, immune-mediated syndrome in which the spinal cord becomes inflamed. At the onset of transverse myelitis, immune cells mistakenly invade the body, specifically attacking the spinal cord, often damaging the protective myelin coating. [2]\n\nThe syndrome was extremely rare until the 1920s, when hundreds of cases were diagnosed following administration of rabies and smallpox vaccines. Later research revealed that transverse myelitis is a post-infectious disorder.\n\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, vaccines are a primary cause of transverse myelitis, and doctors are trained to ask patients who are seeking treatment if they have recently been vaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccines, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines, and diphtheria-tetanus (Tdap) vaccines have been implicated in causing cases of transverse myelitis. [3]\n\nThe onset of symptoms is commonly sudden and severe. Many people who develop transverse myelitis initially notice frightening symptoms, including pain, often in their neck or back, which is what happened to RD.\n\nThey may also experience shooting sensations radiating through their arms, legs, and abdomen; abnormal sensations, including numbness, burning, coldness, tingling, tightness of the skin, and over sensitivity to touch and temperature; weakness in arms and legs; stumbling; paralysis; bladder and bowel problems, including incontinence and constipation.\n\nRD experienced many of these symptoms as his immune system attacked his own body.\n\nWith striking confidence and a notable tinge of sadness in his voice, RD gave us his recollection of the last days of his normal life:\n\n\u201cThe doctor just said that we needed the chicken pox and the hepatitis A vaccine and we just assumed the doctor knew what he was talking about. My sister received the same vaccines and, thank God, she\u2019s fine.\n\nI got the vaccine on August 12, 2009, and then I was fine for the next two weeks. I complained of a little bit of back pain towards August 29, but we thought it was just muscle soreness from riding my bike.\n\nThen, on August 29, I woke up and I was in excruciating neck pain. I went to go take a shower and I thought I was going to pass out in the shower; how much my neck hurt.\n\nI went in the kitchen and told my mom and dad that I was in excruciating neck pain. My mom rubbed my neck. I ate a little breakfast and then I threw up and I felt better after that.\n\nAfter that, about five minutes later, I tried to lift my arm and I felt the electricity in my arm leave and I couldn\u2019t move it up. I instantly had a feeling of terror and it is still the most horrifying feeling I know.\n\nI kept telling myself that maybe it fell asleep and that it was going to wake up. As the day went on, it didn\u2019t. I began to feel more numbness and tingling. I started to fall off the sofa and my dad had to carry me to my room. My parents then rushed me to the hospital.\n\nAt the hospital they intubated me. They weren\u2019t sure what I had so they sent me to the local regional hospital. I was transferred to a local trauma unit because they didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of this because I was intubated and knocked out, but they gave me an MRI and a spinal tap. The next day, on August 30, I was diagnosed with acute transverse myelitis. I was completely paralyzed from the neck down.\n\nIt hit my brain a little bit. It hit the vertebrae C1, C2, C3, C4 and a little bit of C5.\u201d\n\nRD shared the details of the first traumatic weeks when he learned to live with a devastating vaccine injury.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t remember any of this, but this was told to me by my parents and my family. During the next week, they got in touch with Johns Hopkins Medical Center where there was a specialist. Myelitis is like an autoimmune disorder. My immune system thought my nerves were bad, so it attacked them.\n\nThey gave me one treatment called IVIG that confused my immune system and it stopped attacking my spine. They also gave me a chemotherapy treatment.\n\nThey also gave me seven treatments called plasmapheresis. Basically, I had a tube in my upper right thigh that were attached to a machine. Every few days, it pulled the old plasma out of my blood and put new plasma in to me. Antibodies are in the plasma, so this was done to remove the antibodies that were attacking my spine.\n\nSince I was numb, I couldn\u2019t feel this; however, I do recall that, for some reason, as I had more treatments whenever the machine was on, I felt a pain where the tubes were.\n\nWhen they do spinal taps, they also pull out spinal fluid. They had that fluid, so once I was stabilized, the doctors used that to determine what caused the myelitis.\n\nThe doctors asked what vaccines I had. The doctor of Columbia Medical Center in New York City found the varicella virus in my spinal fluid.\n\nThe first day I got sick, they also did another test, NMO, neuromyelitis optica, to see if my body could produce the antibody naturally that could cause myelitis. The first test came back negative, that my body was not able to produce the antibody.\n\nOver the course of two years, I had two more of those tests, to produce medically sound results. Those tests all came back negative.\u201d\n\nSo, then what happened, on September 25, about a month later, I was then transferred to rehabilitation in New York City. I spent six months there in inpatient rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nContemplating how his life changed so suddenly, unexpectedly, and tragically, RD said:\n\n\u201cIt was really terrible. I was lucky and I feel I\u2019m regaining something, but it is a horrible experience to go from a normal life to not being able to use your limbs anymore.\n\nSadly, RD will suffer symptoms of his vaccine injury for the rest of his life. Transverse myelitis is a disease with lifelong effects which can include pain; stiffness; painful muscle spasms; partial or total paralysis of arms, legs, or both; sexual dysfunction; and very commonly, depression and anxiety, due to the stress of living with chronic pain.\n\nAccording to the Transverse Myelitis Association, a nonprofit foundation offering support to individuals with rare, immune-neurological disorders, \u201cthere are very few clinical centers with physicians who specialize in transverse myelitis.\u201d RD and his family travel four hours twice a year to receive treatment at a facility that specializes in this condition.\n\nYou can imagine the agony any parent would feel as they helplessly watch their healthy, able-bodied child become paralyzed and endure many painful medical procedures. On that fateful day, the lives of RD\u2019s family members changed forever, too.\n\n\u201cHe was a very independent young man, little boy, and teenager, very responsible, and then he had to become dependent on every little thing in his life, totally dependent on his mother and father and his sister for everything.\n\nYou make the most of it but it does take everything out of you in life. Even though you move, on it\u2019s always lingering in my mind.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to watch because he doesn\u2019t know what he is missing. He hasn\u2019t experienced what normal teenagers do. I know what he is missing, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard for a parent to watch their child not experience normal things that teenagers experience. We have sheltered his life a lot because he doesn\u2019t experience independence. He doesn\u2019t really enjoy going out with normal people because he can\u2019t just go to the bathroom by himself and he can\u2019t just go to a food establishment and order food.\n\nHis summer consists of catching up on therapy. We do take him to the spinal center for about four hours of therapy a day. Now that he is older, most children are going on to internships and moving on with life, and he is going to catch up on therapy. It\u2019s just a reminder.\n\nI do speak to a lot of the parents whose children have myelitis, many of which are caused by vaccines.\n\nMy husband takes vacation time because the spinal center is four hours from our house. It\u2019s just what you do on your \u2018free\u2019 vacation time. We know things could be worse but it\u2019s still hard to watch what we have to watch because you don\u2019t want to see your child suffer.\n\nIt does affect the siblings. My daughter has been affected by this. She does want to become a physical therapist. She\u2019s been at the rehabilitation center for the past seven years when we go.\n\nAs a child, you could sweep it under the carpet. She has times when she cries about it. All of her friends\u2019 siblings are doing things, driving or going away to college, and it\u2019s a different lifestyle than for her brother. She tries to not let it consume her but it hurts her.\n\nI wish I could go back and change everything.\u201d\n\nRD reflected on the last seven years of living with a vaccine injury:\n\n\u201cAll of the tragedy that initially happened, over all these years, I try to focus on the good things. I like to talk about the positive things. I don\u2019t make it sound as negative as it actually was. I try to live positively now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to have a social life outside of school. Right now I commute to college. I don\u2019t live there. I have a lot of friends at school but I don\u2019t do anything outside of class. Now that I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve realized what I missed out on.\n\nAt night, I have to wear Night Rangers and a hand brace to stretch my legs and my hand. My dad has to come in every night and help me untangle my sheets. The braces get caught in the sheets. I never sleep through the night. I have to inconvenience my dad to help me. He has to get up at six in the morning and he gets home at twelve at night because he has to work overtime.\n\nWhenever we have to leave the house, it has to be planned because we have the wheelchair. Life can\u2019t be spontaneous.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, the government has created an underutilized database, known as the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), to keep track of reactions to vaccinations.\n\nDue to rising litigation against vaccine manufacturers in the 1970s and 1980s, and the large awards the vaccine manufacturers were having to pay to those who were injured by vaccines, many vaccine manufacturers began to leave the vaccine market. In response to this situation, in 1986, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) was passed. This legislation shielded the vaccine manufacturers from liability that resulted from administration of a vaccination. One of the intents of this program was to compensate victims of vaccine injury fairly, quickly and efficiently. [4]\n\nThis program has awarded approximately $3.4 billion to individuals and families who have suffered vaccine injury and death. These awards are funded by taxes on vaccines. [5]\n\nIt should be noted that, after the Vaccine Act was passed in 1986, shielding the vaccine manufacturers from liability, the CDC modified the childhood immunization schedule, greatly increasing the number of vaccines American children receive. In 1983, the CDC recommended 11 doses of 4 vaccines by the time a child was 16. Today the CDC recommends that a child receive 49 doses of 14 vaccines by the age of six. [6, 7]\n\nRD explained his experience with the process of requesting compensation through vaccine court:\n\n\u201cI find that a lot of people don\u2019t know that the government has a program to compensate people with vaccine injuries. Not many people know that and they are shocked and surprised when they find out.\n\nI think that getting more information out about vaccine court is important. The fund is actually funded by taxpayers; $.75 of each vaccine goes into the fund.\n\nQuite honestly, too, the vaccine court is all set up and they really need to do a much better job of properly compensating and treating the people who go through the vaccine compensation process. If they mandate the vaccine, they should really do a better job of treating people fairly. The maximum amount a family is entitled to for pain and suffering is $250,000.\n\nThere are many things that are just very backwards, that just don\u2019t make sense, that you can\u2019t believe are actually the law. You can\u2019t fight anything and there is no jury because it is all laid out by a law.\u201d\n\nRD\u2019s experience in vaccine court can only be described as a tragedy. RD was a teenager going through this process as a Petitioner, hoping for an award that would enable him to have a walker, therapy appointments, and some compensation for the lost wages and pain he would face for the rest of his life. He watched helplessly as his requests were met with constant opposition from the lawyer who was representing HHS.\n\n\u201cThe whole process was twisted; at first, the things the opposing lawyer and her team would do were screwed up, but not too bad. For example, there was one thing in the life care plan,that every five years, I would get two new walkers so I could keep one in the house and one in the car. They fought against it the whole way, until we backed down.\n\nShe said, \u2018If I gave you two walkers, then I would have to give everyone two walkers.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize having two walkers, that would have been $75 extra every five years, was a luxury.\n\nThis instance was head-scratching, but then things got worse, much worse.\n\nThey said in the life care plan that I didn\u2019t need a physical therapist. They said I could use an exercise DVD.\n\nThat was just insulting. It was insulting not only to me and my family, but to all physical therapists. There is no shape, way, or form that an exercise DVD will ever be able to replicate the trained eye of a licensed PT. The opposing lawyer later apologized and said no insult was ever intended.\n\nToward the end of the case, we began mediation. Before the first meeting, we met with the mediator. We were told by the mediator to take emotion out of the case because they weren\u2019t going to have it in the case. They really don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nA member of RD\u2019s legal team commented, \u201cIn getting his award, the law firm, RD, and his family fought tooth and nail for things that he needs for his medical care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was one point in the case that the opposing lawyer cried and told me she wished she could give me the moon. She claimed she would give more money for home modifications if we had someone come for a home visit, to evaluate modifications we could make to our home environment.\n\nOnce she got the results, she strung us along for four more months and then she disregarded his advice and refused to give more money. It was very upsetting that she wasted our time like this.\n\nBut this kept happening. Things like this happened too much. It was very strange.\n\nToward the end of the case, right after the home mods incident, we had a final mediation. At the mediation, there was a letter that had to deal with lost wages. We discovered that she had been cherry picking numbers from the letter, to support what she believed my lost wages should be.\n\nBy using the proper numbers, not the ones she cherry-picked, I was entitled to much more money, but she refused to give me the full amount. She basically took away money for no apparent reason. If we questioned it, she would get angry and even threatened to drag the case along for many more years.\n\nMaybe the reason she treated me like this was because, at that point, I was nineteen, so maybe she didn\u2019t care. Or maybe she didn\u2019t like that I was intelligent and saw what she was doing to us. It was just unbelievable that she would push so hard against me.\n\nTo do this to a young man and his family who have gone through so much struggle and heartache, I believe you truly have to be a very special kind of person. And I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n\nWhat RD and His Family Have Learned About Vaccines\n\nRD\u2019s mom gave thought to words she would share with families who are making decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their children:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole population of people who are affected by vaccines. If anybody really wants to know, they should go to a spinal cord injury center and they would probably be able to find a multitude of people who have been affected by vaccines.\n\nMost of the people, the physical therapists, are wearing masks because the flu vaccine is mandatory and they don\u2019t want to get the flu vaccine. They work with people who are there with injuries because of vaccines.\n\nThe doctors, for some reason, if they don\u2019t get the vaccines, they will be discredited. They know what happens with the vaccines and they don\u2019t want to put their body through that.\n\nIt\u2019s a very controversial situation, the vaccines, too. A few years ago they had the measles outbreak. When they show somebody whose child was not vaccinated, they always show some crazy-looking person.\n\nI was very in tune and agitated with how they represented the people who don\u2019t get vaccines. Patricia Finn was on CNN and she represented herself very well; 99 percent of the people they show in the news who don\u2019t get vaccinated don\u2019t look credible. They look like they wouldn\u2019t be judged as someone who is making a conscious decision about their child.\n\nI have to stay away when someone is putting something on social media about vaccines. It\u2019s very agitating how people are representing vaccines.\u201d\n\nRD shared his own thoughts about vaccine injuries:\n\n\u201cPeople fail to realize there is a percentage of people who are suffering from vaccine injuries. Either they don\u2019t believe you can get a vaccine injury, or someone who gets a vaccine injury, and they don\u2019t realize you can actually get vaccine injuries.\n\nI feel that if you present that [the results of three separate, conclusive medical tests] to any fair minded person, they should be able to put two and two together and know that the vaccines caused the myelitis.\n\nI will never get another vaccine and my sister won\u2019t. It\u2019s very scary that they are trying to mandate things, forcing people to take medication or inject things into their bodies.\u201d\n\nRD\u2019s mom stated, with frustration evident in her voice:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s poison. They are telling people what they have to do. It\u2019s like playing Russian roulette. They don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nRD added, speaking about the benefit of acquiring natural immunity, rather than the temporary \u2018protection\u2019 of vaccination, \u201cIf you get chicken pox naturally, your body will recognize it for the rest of its life.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople believe that it\u2019s this thing that should never be questioned. It\u2019s very amazing that the opposition to it is just stifled so much. People are called lunatics if they actually question and bring forward the truth.\u201d\n\nRD, speaking with wisdom gained through painful experience, advised parent and teens:\n\n\u201cNever just believe the doctor. Always find out what the side effects are. See if you should be tested if you even need the vaccine. I would say no, but if you are being forced or mandated, see if you can get tested first for antibodies, or don\u2019t get the vaccine at all.\u201d\n\nRD\u2019s mother shared her own advice for families who are deciding whether or not to vaccinate:\n\n\u201cI would definitely want to be tested first for antibodies. I feel that, according to our case, the pain and the injury outweigh [the benefits of] the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth the years of suffering and continued suffering is not worth [missing] three days of being itchy with the chicken pox.\u201d\n\nWhat To Do If Your Child Is Vaccine-Injured\n\nEven though health care providers are required by law to report vaccine injuries, it is estimated that only 1-10% of adverse reactions to vaccines are actually reported.\n\nParents may not know that common reactions to vaccines, including fevers, long bouts of crying, or rashes following vaccination should be reported to their child\u2019s doctor. When a more serious adverse event occurs, parents may be too overwhelmed to make sure a report is filed.\n\nIf your child is injured after a vaccine, inform your child\u2019s healthcare provider immediately. If your child\u2019s doctor will not file a report, you can file a claim yourself. However, it is recommended to retain an attorney who is familiar with this process and the requirements of the program. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program pays for legal fees and reasonable costs in pursuit of a vaccine injury claim.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about this government program, you may wish to read The Scary Facts Most Parents Don\u2019t Know About Vaccine Injury Compensation.\n\nRD\u2019s attorney, Patricia Finn, known as \u201cthe good health lawyer,\u201d is a vaccine injury and exemption attorney based in New York who has represented thousands of families with exemption matters and has been representing vaccine injury victims in Vaccine Court for more than ten years. She advises individuals and parents, \u201cIf you believe you have been injured by a vaccine, seek medical treatment and call our office to see if you are eligible to file a claim for vaccine injury in the Vaccine Court.\u201d\n\nDoctors often assure parents that vaccines are safe, using phrases like \u201cone in a million\u201d and \u201crare\u201d to describe adverse reactions. Yet, with sad stories like RD\u2019s, thousands of adverse events reported to VAERS, and the creation of a special court for vaccine injuries, informed parents know those vaccine safety claims are simply not true.\n\nIf you have not already done so, please consider the overall safety of vaccinations. A federal program has awarded billions of dollars, through an arduous, emotionally painful process, to people whose family members have suffered injury or death at the legally protected hands of pharmaceutical companies.\n\nIf vaccines are so safe, why do we need federal programs to compensate victims, meanwhile protecting the vaccine makers?", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://vactruth.com/2016/12/30/boy-permanently-disabled-wins-court-case/", "site_name": "VacTruth.com", "title": "13 Year-Old Boy Permanently Disabled from Chicken Pox Vaccine Wins His Case in Vaccine Court | VacTruth.com", "image": "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vaccine-injured-boy.jpg", "description": "A young man was recently awarded compensation in the United States Court of Federal Claims Vaccine Court,\u00a0for injuries he sustained after being administered the hepatitis A and varicella vaccinations in 2009.\u00a0 After five long years of litigation, Health and Human Services (HHS), the Respondent in all vaccine injury cases, conceded that the varicella vaccination did \u2026", "locale": "en_US", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vaccinetruth/", "article:author": "vaccinetruth", "article:tag": "Varicella vaccine", "article:section": "Law & Policy", "article:published_time": "2016-12-30T17:43:57-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-11-26T06:29:42-05:00", "updated_time": "2017-11-26T06:29:42-05:00", "image:secure_url": "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vaccine-injured-boy.jpg", "image:width": "640", "image:height": "429"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://vactruth.com/category/vaccine-law-policy/", "https://vactruth.com/author/missyfluegge/", "//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://vactruth.com/2016/12/30/boy-permanently-disabled-wins-court-case/", "https://twitter.com/share?text=13 Year-Old Boy Permanently Disabled from Chicken Pox Vaccine Wins His Case in Vaccine Court:&url=https://vactruth.com/2016/12/30/boy-permanently-disabled-wins-court-case/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://vactruth.com/2016/12/30/boy-permanently-disabled-wins-court-case/&media=https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vaccine-injured-boy.jpg", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://vactruth.com/2016/12/30/boy-permanently-disabled-wins-court-case/", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/fileclaim.html", "https://vactruth.com/2015/02/19/vaccine-injury-compensation/", "https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2010vv0566-82", "https://myelitis.org/living-with-myelitis/disease-information/#tm", "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/transverse-myelitis/basics/causes/con-20028884", "http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-injury-compensation-programs", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/data/index.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/images/schedule1983s.jpg", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html", "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wactout81/5646829664/in/photolist-9AZtJ9-6u6DMo-8dmkrp-cL1xu1-6a53cn-vawj2q-cKPgLS-rZyX-oYfxPh-oToARM-cxa1zW-pEcuwd-oT6aGF-c5WafW-cKWT3q-8dmDYF-pJuWsV-8M3zC7-7rV4vo-cqpMYU-bq1HsB-i5d1c-7ScLXL-dgpMz-8M3ziJ-oBfkAQ-cKQfnU-9RqE7Z-bDCoC4-318T9-zSbu8-i4apEh-8mEC4E-5MB2HC-m3oNK-bjRhed-5rDui-qVkfqM-4nqn9V-9PojEX-8NJ3rC-nR8JeL-96GHS2-epPSiw-ybT5x-2ADHxW-8KFDv7-7z7bGd-6rkqce-8bhcPt"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016-12-30T17:43:57-05:00"}
