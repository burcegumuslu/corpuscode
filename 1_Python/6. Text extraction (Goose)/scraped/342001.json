Circuit, while also rejecting as \u201cmoot\u201d the administration\u2019s attempts to overturn a hold on the mandate that OSHA published on November 5.\n\nAccording to the Emergency Temporary Standard published by the administration, private employers with 100 or more employees will be required to impose a mandatory vaccine-or-test policy. It also requires unvaccinated workers to wear masks inside the workplace, with violators facing potential penalties up to tens of thousands of dollars per incident.\n\nUpon the publication of the OSHA Rule, a torrent of lawsuits from Republican-led states, businesses and individuals rained on the Biden administration. They have so far successfully blocked the most sweeping initiatives by the Democratic president, which were created to drive up vaccination rates.\n\nMore than four-fifths of adults nationwide have already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Biden said his various mandates are important in curtailing the virus that killed over 780,000 people in the United States.\n\nThe 5th Circuit granted a motion to stay on the ETS and ordered that the OSHA \u201ctake no steps to implement or enforce\u201d it until further court orders. This prompted OSHA to announce the suspension of the rule pending litigation.\n\nSeveral legal challenges also appeared later on, and the Ohio-based 6th Circuit Court was selected via lottery to hear the consolidated lawsuits. The Biden administration also filed a motion to lift the 5th Circuit\u2019s stay on the mandate and get the case moved to a more favorable court. On December 3, the 6th Circuit denied the requests.\n\nLegal challenge will likely end up in SC\n\nRob Natelson, a former constitutional law professor, wrote the legal challenge to the OSHA rule will likely end up in the Supreme Court. He said that the high court will likely weigh in on several issues regarding the ETS, which include whether or not the mandate exceeds the powers that the Constitution grants to the federal government, and whether or not OSHA exceeds its authority under its statute. It will also ruminate on whether or not the vaccine-or-test requirement denies individuals the due process of law. (Related: BREAKING: OSHA announces it will comply with 5th Circuit Appeals Court and SUSPEND Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate.)\n\nThe 5th Circuit ruled the OSHA mandate to be \u201cfatally flawed\u201d and said that it will likely be declared unconstitutional. Opponents to Biden\u2019s mandates have taken a three-tiered approach to challenging the president. They contended that the vaccine mandates were imposed without proper public comment, were not authorized by Congress and that it infringes on state rights to regulate public health matters.\n\nGregory Magarian, a constitutional law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said: \u201cThe reasoning across the cases is basically the same, which is that these statutes don\u2019t give the president or the agency in question the authority to issue the mandates.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration also contends that the rule-making authority is firm and supersedes any state policies prohibiting vaccine requirements. Recent experience shows that such mandates prompt people to get vaccinated.\n\nIn its November 23 filing, the Biden administration argued that the 5th Circuit erroneously interpreted the OSHA mandate, saying that \u201cthe speculative compliance costs and similar harms asserted by regulated parties cannot overcome the extraordinary harms to the public interest\u201d as detailed in the document.\n\nWhite House lawyers claimed that \u201cdelaying the standard would likely cost many lives per day, in addition to large numbers of hospitalizations, other serious health effects, and tremendous expenses. That is a confluence of harms of the highest order.\u201d\n\nRead more news related to the coronavirus pandemic at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Court rules against Biden admin in vaccine mandate lawsuit", "type": "article", "url": "2021-12-08-court-rules-against-government-vaccine-mandate-lawsuit.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "The United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit has officially denied the federal government's motion to transfer the lawsuit that challenged the\u00a0Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine-or-test requirement to a different court.", "image": "wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2021/12/Law-Judgement-Legal-Court-Barrister-Constitution-Lawyer.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2021-12-08T11:01:19+00:00", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "666", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2021-12-08T09:55:43+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-08T11:01:19+00:00", "article:author": "author/maryvillarealdw", "article:publisher": "/", "article:section": "Joe Biden", "article:tag": "white house"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "Joe Biden", "big government", "medical fascism", "vaccine wars", "White House", "Resist", "revolt", "Supreme Court", "vaccine mandate", "Medical Tyranny", "vaccines", "health freedom", "OSHA"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/6th-circuit-court-rules-against-biden-administration-in-osha-vaccine-mandate-lawsuit_4138876.html", "https://www.8newsnow.com/news/health/coronavirus-health/vaccine-mandates-on-hold-courts-put-a-stop-to-sweeping-requirements-for-now/", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-17-osha-announces-it-will-comply-with-5th-circuit-appeals-court-suspend-bidens-vaccine-mandate.html", "https://wustl.edu/", "http://Pandemic.news", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/6th-circuit-court-rules-against-biden-administration-in-osha-vaccine-mandate-lawsuit_4138876.html", "https://www.8newsnow.com/news/health/coronavirus-health/vaccine-mandates-on-hold-courts-put-a-stop-to-sweeping-requirements-for-now/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-12-08T09:55:43+00:00"}
