During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she repeatedly used her platform on Twitter and TikTok to question the vaccines, promote ivermectin as a treatment, and call out pharmacists for refusing to dispense it. But her efforts resulted in significant backlash. On Nov. 7, 2021, Dr. Danielle Jones, an OBGYN who posts under the handle @MamaDoctorJones on YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter\u2014and has millions of followers\u2014put out a video accusing Bowden of \u201cgrifting,\u201d rejecting science, and profiting from those who questioned the vaccine. The video received thousands of comments, including from Team Halo members, Dr. Zachary Rubin, a pediatrician, and Christina Kim, an oncology nurse practitioner. Team Halo is a social media influencer campaign formed as part of the United Nations Verified initiative and the Vaccine Confidence Project to increase vaccine uptake. \u201cThat doc is problematic,\u201d Rubin wrote. Kim followed with, \u201cWow. That \u2018doctor\u2019 should have her license revoked.\u201d\n\n\u201cDEFENDERS OF SCIENCE:\u201d The biggest defenders of science did the most damage to it.\n\nI know the pandemic is winding down when I see \u2018science influencers,\u2019 \u2018debunkers\u2019 and the \u2018misinformation police\u2019 return to focusing on issues that match their skill set: debunking vitamins, supplements, cupping, homeopathy, electric fields and other clearly unproven and implausible medical interventions. . . . The science influencers came to our rescue, or so they believed. They knew that the CDC\u2019s recommendations\u2014 under a Democratic president\u2014 were always correct when they advocated for interventions and restrictions, and only incorrect for not going further. Of course, we should mask toddlers\u2014 the only error the CDC made was not doing it sooner and longer. Of course, we should boost 16 year old men\u2014 even if they had COVID\u2014 and of course, they should get a bivalent booster\u2014 even if they had COVID again. Of course, schools should mandate vaccines. In fact, mandates would not be needed if it weren\u2019t for anti-science grifters. If only we would all dutifully get all the doses, Lord Peter Marks advised, and take Paxlovid as Emperor Jha suggested, we would be better off (irrespective of age or prior infection). Indeed, soft target \u2018debunkers\u2019 turned their criticism of alternative medicines into a remix of \u2018the establishment is always right, and if anything, doesn\u2019t go far enough\u2019. It was no coincidence that this fell along lines of political preference (left wing), and among insular communities on social media. The debunkers were united in disparate beliefs: masks work and Elon Musk is bad. . . . Add to this mix: growing political fanaticism. Trump indeed broke brains. Although he is not currently president, he remains the most discussed politician. As Sagar Enjeti recently said, \u2018the Trump era began when he descended the escalator and will end only when he dies.\u2019 Soft target debunkers largely oppose Trump, and some of their scientific beliefs are supported merely by the fact Trump said the opposite. What happens when you pair mediocre scientists with political fanaticism and inject health policy decisions made by partisan administrations? The answer is chaos. The debunkers have no skillset to separate sound decisions from bad ones.\n\nThe way you defend sciences is by explaining, debating, and engaging with people who have different theories and hypotheses. Silencing and bullying isn\u2019t the same.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "CDC Partners With \u2018Social and Behavior Change\u2019 Initiative to Silence Vaccine Hesitancy"}, "tags": ["initiative", "partners", "change", "vaccine", "behavior", "social", "silence"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">CDC Partners With \u2018Social and Behavior Change\u2019 Initiative to Silence Vaccine Hesitancy <a href=\"https://t.co/Uuudmk3XPQ\">t.co/Uuudmk3XPQ</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Lyndsey, RN\ud83d\udc99 (@HouseLyndsey) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HouseLyndsey/status/1645287474715844608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">RFK Jr. Explains How He Began Investigating the Vaccine Industry &amp; Uncovered 'Agency Capture on Steroids'</p>\n<p>\"All of my conspiracy theories have about a 3 month shelf life before they become reality\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RobertKennedyJr</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hillsdale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Hillsdale</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4vHVm2mQFp\">pic.twitter.com/4vHVm2mQFp</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheChiefNerd/status/1645065873961414657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fcdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy%2F&text=CDC%20Partners%20With%20%E2%80%98Social%20and%20Behavior%20Change%E2%80%99%20Initiative%20to%20Silence%20Vaccine%20Hesitancy", "https://gab.com/compose?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fcdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy%2F&text=CDC%20Partners%20With%20%E2%80%98Social%20and%20Behavior%20Change%E2%80%99%20Initiative%20to%20Silence%20Vaccine%20Hesitancy", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/cdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy/", "https://gettr.com/share?text=CDC%20Partners%20With%20%E2%80%98Social%20and%20Behavior%20Change%E2%80%99%20Initiative%20to%20Silence%20Vaccine%20Hesitancy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investmentwatchblog.com%2Fcdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy%2F", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/cdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy/", "https://t.co/Uuudmk3XPQ", "https://twitter.com/HouseLyndsey/status/1645287474715844608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/debunkers-return-to-the-soft-targets?utm_source=direct&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web", "https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Hillsdale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/4vHVm2mQFp", "https://twitter.com/TheChiefNerd/status/1645065873961414657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/food-supply-three-states-to-recall-61k-pounds-of-ready-to-eat-sausage-poultry-company-recalls-over-11k-pounds-of-frozen-turkey-patties/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/costco-reports-50-price-hikes-on-thousands-of-different-items-as-ceo-warns-of-difficult-times/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/why-did-fox-news-fire-tucker-carlson/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/big-corporations-out-of-nowhere-kroger-owned-frys-food-stores-kay-jewelers-hallmark-and-now-door-dash-have-all-sent-opt-out-of-mothers-day/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/meet-the-team-that-killed-bud-light/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/ray-epps-daughter-confirms-he-is-a-pedophile/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/world-bank-whistleblower-karen-hudes-lost-her-life-soon-after-a-series-of-interviews-like-this-can-you-guess-why/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/fda-vaccines-do-not-require-demonstration-of-the-prevention-of-infection-or-transmission/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/bed-bath-beyond-files-for-bankruptcy-reddit-leftists-freaking-out-after-buying-stock-in-get-rich-quick-scheme-feel-sick/", "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/the-dragon-is-on-fire/"], "authors": ["IWB"], "publish_date": "2023-04-10T08:27:07-04:00"}
