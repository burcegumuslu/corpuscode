The news was highlighted with concern only by the counter-information media.\n\nMainstream American newspapers have welcomed it as an almost obvious brucratic step. Although huge unknowns about the real safety dangers hang over this risky decision.\n\nThe first is that the new bivalent vaccines have been marketed with an emergency use authorization despite not having had a regular period of specific clinical trials on children but having only been tested on mice and then administered to adults (without the rigorous follow-up required by clinical trials).\n\nAlthough some alarming research already exists: that of the Wuerzburg University Hospital and that of the Cleveland Clinic which have found the adverse reactions of bivalents more serious and more frequent than monovalents.\n\nAnd the findings of the same CDC and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, regulatory body of medicines in the USA) which have highlighted warnings of risks of cerebral ischemia precisely from the new Pfizer-Biontech boosters. The alarm has so far been raised only for the over 65s because the elderly were the first to receive the third bivalent dose for the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and for the variants of Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 (BA.4 /BA.5) of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore only in this age group is there a statistically significant monitoring\u2026\n\nTherefore, the programming of these vaccinations for children transforms them into human guinea pigs on which to test the effective efficacy and safety of these boosters.\n\nIt should also be noted that a general study of all mRNA vaccines conducted by the CDC reported that in just two years of inoculations they had a number of undesirable effects 5.5 higher than that of all other vaccines since 2009 and with as many as 770 types of adverse reactions, many of which are serious.\n\nIn addition to all this, it should be noted that the package insert for Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty drug specifies this alarming note:\n\n\u201cThe efficacy and safety of the vaccine have not been evaluated in immunocompromised individuals, including those on immunosuppressive therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 may be less in immunocompromised individuals.\u201d\n\nAdded to this is another very serious concern intelligently highlighted by the editor Brian Shilhavy of the American Catholic site Health Impact News (article below), who has always been attentive above all to the repercussions on children of mRNA gene serums.\n\nThe one that the American government can link the inoculation of these scheduled pediatric anti-Covid vaccines to the granting of various forms of social and scholastic assistance for children.\n\nTHE BIVALENT COVID-19 VACCINES FOR KIDS TOO\n\nThe CDC confirmed below the use of bivalent vaccines for kids too:\n\nThe following COVID-19 vaccines, categorized into three vaccine types, are currently approved under a Biologics License Application (BLA) or authorized under an EUA by FDA (Table 1):\n\nJanssen COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for adults ages 18 years and older in certain limited situations due to safety considerations (see Appendix A).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine products (see Table 1) are formulated as follows:\n\u2022 Monovalent vaccine: The vaccine product is based on the original (ancestral) strain of SARS-CoV-2\n\u2022 Bivalent vaccine: The vaccine product is based on the original (ancestral) strain of SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 (BA.4/BA.5) variants of SARS-CoV-2\n\nCDC Adds EUA COVID Shots to their Childhood Immunization Schedule to Target Poor Families on Government Aid\n\nThe CDC has announced on February, 10, 2023 that they have added the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d to their childhood immunization schedule.\n\nThe COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d now add another 2-3 doses of vaccines to the 25 doses of other vaccines already on the CDC schedule that can be injected into babies and toddlers during their first 15 months of life.\n\nThis seems to be the first time in the history of the CDC that vaccines that are not even FDA-approved but only have EUAs (emergency use authorizations) have been added to the CDC childhood immunization schedule.\n\nHow is this even legal? CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, while appearing before Congress yesterday, was asked why these shots were added to the Child Immunization schedule.\n\nThe Vaccines For Children (VFC) program is a U.S. Government program to provide vaccines to low-income families receiving government aid through the Medicaid program.\n\nCould this be a path the U.S. Government is creating to require lower-income families to have their children vaccinated in order to receive other Government aid benefits, such as food stamps?\n\nIf Brazil is an example of what is to come here in the U.S., then it is most certainly possible, if not probable.\n\nHaving the CDC add the EUA COVID shots to their childhood immunization schedule also opens the door for local health departments and school districts to now add these shots to the CDC list of already recommended vaccines as a requirement for school attendance.\n\nAt this point, my guess would be that the FDA will fully approve these \u201cvaccines\u201d before the next school year starts, and the Secretary of Heath and Human Services (HHS) will move the shots into the NVICP (National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program) giving the pharmaceutical companies legal immunity for any injuries and deaths, even after they are no longer covered by the PREP Act and the CounterMeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP).\n\nThanks to Wayne Rhode, author of \u201cThe Vaccine Court\u201c, and his input into the reporting of this article.
