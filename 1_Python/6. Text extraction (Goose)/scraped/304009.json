This new year brings a special opportunity to create new healthy habits, think positively, be more productive and with the rollout of the new COVID-19 vaccine, hopefully return to some semblance of pre-pandemic normalcy. Many New Year\u2019s resolutions tend to fizzle out by February, often due to the ways they are conceptualized. Goals that are too vague, like,\u201cI\u2019m going to lose weight next year,\u201d or overly ambitious visions, such as, \u201cI\u2019m going to quit caffeine, nicotine and sugar all at once,\u201d are a perfect setup for failure. However, this narrative is avoidable. Change can be achieved through realistic expectations and self-acceptance, and a solid foundation of physical and mental health.\n\nROOT aims to provide the tools needed to optimize the body and mind. By neutralizing environmental pollutants, flushing out toxins, and promoting mental calmness and clarity, ROOT\u2019s products tackle the most common barriers to success. In a new approach to wellness, ROOT\u2019s products help support the body\u2019s natural mechanisms rather than introducing synthetic health aids. Instead, this extra boost can kick-start metabolic rejuvenation, cleanse cells, calm inflammation and neutralize blockages in digestive binding sites, allowing for more efficient nutrient absorption. The brand is founded on these core values: Integrity Authenticity, Simplicity and Education. ROOT believes that all humans are created equal, and each person\u2019s unique potential can be unblocked by removing the causes of disease, rather than treating symptoms.\n\nWhether your ultimate 2021 includes a new fitness regimen, professional endeavor, creative project or educational opportunity, cognitive health must be top priority. ROOT\u2019s Zero-In, a daily energy-boosting capsule, is designed to fight and eliminate brain fog and promote razor-sharp focus and attention span. Made with turmeric, pine bark, velvet bean seed and vitamin D, Zero-In is a natural alternative to synthetic stimulants and energy beverages. This organic, non-GMO formula helps to improve the delivery of oxygen to brain cells and increases dopamine levels for up to 14 hours, supplying the brain with \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormones and supporting long-term neurological health. For those interested in a post-holiday dietary purge, turn to Clean Slate, ROOT\u2019s detoxifying zeolite blend. Clean Slate works to give the body a \u201cfactory reset\u201d using nanofragments that act as toxin scavengers, helping to eliminate impurities throughout the body, including brain tissue.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "ROOT Brand: New Year, New Supplements - The Purist", "description": "Enter 2021 the right way with detoxifying wellness aids from the ROOT brand.
