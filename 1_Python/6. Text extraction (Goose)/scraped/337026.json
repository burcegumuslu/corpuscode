When they with all the usual pro-vaccine arguments and propaganda and why children must be vaccinated, Trump got them with one line:\n\n\u201cBut I want smaller doses [for children] over a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nWhat really backfired on CNN was their attempts then to have Ben Carson attack Trump\u2019s comment. Instead, Carson agreed, \u201cWe are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time\u2026\u201d\n\nRand Paul, also expressed his concern that evening, said \u201cI\u2019m all for vaccines, but I\u2019m also for freedom. I\u2019m concerned about how they\u2019re bunched up\u2026 I ought to have the right to spread out the vaccines a little bit\u2026\u201d\n\nMike Huckabee followed up with a \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this country focus on cures rather than treatment? Why don\u2019t we focus on the cure for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s?\u201d\n\nIt was with that, CNN very quickly changed the subject.\n\nIn the same year, Trump admitted his strong distrust of the flu vaccine. In an interview with Opie and Anthony on Sirius XM, Trump described flu shots as \u201ctotally ineffective,\u201d stating he had never had one and had never come down with the flu.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had one. And thus far I\u2019ve never had the flu. I don\u2019t like the idea of injecting bad stuff into your body. And that\u2019s basically what they do. And this one (latest flu vaccine) has not been very effective to start off with.\n\n\u201cI have friends that religiously get the flu shot and then they get the flu. You know, that helps my thinking. I\u2019ve seen a lot of reports that the last flu shot is virtually totally ineffective.\u201d\n\nEveryone knows \u2013 and Big Pharma companies around the world admit to it \u2013 that mercury, a powerful neurotoxin is contained in a vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine industry itself, is also utterly protected after Congress passed law protecting them against lawsuits and criminal prosecution, essentially granting them legal immunity \u2013 even if a person dies as a result of their vaccine.\n\nAny level of mercury in the body is not good. Any self-respecting scientist will agree with that simple statement. \n\n\n\nPushing copious amounts of vaccines on an infant under the latest schedules and within such short time frames has never fully been investigated long term. And now, in the United States and Australia, the law is there to punish all those parents who refuse to have their child immunised according to the schedule \u2013 including the latest hepatitis shot.\n\nFast forward to 2017, and the argument about vaccine protocols is still there. But one thing has changed, and that is Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States.\n\nThe big question is, will Donald Trump hold Big Pharma accountable? If there is ever an executive order to pass it\u2019s the one that removes the legal immunity from such companies, force further research, and slow down the immunisation schedule for children.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s own words: \u201cI\u2019m in favor of vaccines [but] do them over a longer period of time, same amount, but just in little sections. I think you\u2019re going to have \u2014 I think you\u2019re going to see a big impact on autism.\u201d\n\nThis article (Trump is Anti-Flu Shot and Questions Childhood Vaccine Schedule) is a free and open source.
