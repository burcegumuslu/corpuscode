Among the individuals interviewed in the film was Michoel Green, a Jewish Orthodox rabbi from Massachusetts. Green, which the Times of Israel smeared as an \u201canti-vaccine rabbi,\u201d was fired by the Jewish Chabad movement for discouraging his followers from getting the dangerous injections.\n\nAccording to Green, there was a striking resemblance between how the Nazis demonized the Jews back then and how medical authorities demonized the unvaccinated now. He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re clearly seeing here is a reply of the same telltale signs of what precipitated the Holocaust in the 1930s.\u201d\n\nThe rabbi continued that during the Nazi regime in Germany and the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities engaged in \u201cthe marginalization of that minority\u201d and identification of the said minority \u201cas a threat to public health or a public health risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more morally reprehensible than government or authority of any kind declaring other innocent human beings as a public health risk. And it doesn\u2019t matter if these people claim to be doing so innocently, for the greater good, because that\u2019s what Nazis did as well.\u201d\n\nOne clear example of this dehumanization came in the form of a poster that said \u201cJews are lice; they cause typhus\u201d in the Polish language. According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the poster was \u201cdesigned to link Jews and typhus closely together in the minds of non-Jewish Poles.\u201d It continued: \u201cMedical professionals repeatedly pushed the false claim that Jews were responsible for outbreaks of typhus \u2013 a deadly contagious disease spread by lice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was right out of the Nazi playbook,\u201d the rabbi commented, adding that it was exactly what Joseph Goebbels \u2013 chief propagandist for the Nazi party \u2013 would have done. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t justify marginalization, persecution and apartheid.\u201d (Related: \u2018Right out of the Nazi playbook\u2019: Chabad Rabbi defends Marjorie Greene\u2019s comparison of vaccine mandates to yellow stars in Germany.)\n\nGreen: Medical authorities have become modern-day purveyors of tyranny\n\nThe rabbi also mentioned that the discrimination the Jews faced was similar to how those who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine were barred from entering many establishments. He cited one instance involving a Jewish Holocaust survivor being invited by an orthodox Jewish college to speak. However, the Holocaust survivor\u2019s speaking engagement was eventually canceled \u201cbecause she could not show her vaccine papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing nowadays is precisely that,\u201d Green said. He added that the medical authorities of today \u201chave become the modern-day purveyors of tyranny, persecution and marginalization of the minority.\u201d\n\nGreen also blasted the \u201cgenocide\u201d done in the name of safety perpetrated in places like the city of Shanghai in China, which aligned with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s zero-COVID policy.\n\n\u201cPeople are literally being left to die. They\u2019re being locked into their homes; they\u2019re being denied nutrition, hydration [and] access to medical care in the name of combating an invisible, amorphous disease. That\u2019s exactly what the Nazis were doing.\u201d\n\nThe rabbi also walked the walk when it came to freedom, as he resolutely kept his synagogue open despite then-Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker deeming public worship \u201cnot essential\u201d and ordering that houses of worship be closed.\n\n\u201cI decided right then and there, [and] told my wife: \u2018We are not shutting the doors of our synagogue for one day.\u2019 My wife said: \u2018Well, what if someone gets sick? What if we get sick and die?\u2019 [I replied:] \u2018We have to be ready to die. We have to be ready to die before we allow the government to shut down our religious observances, our right to live and [to] live freely.'\u201d\n\nGreen ultimately remarked that such injustices can only take place when safety and security are elevated as the highest values of society. He argued that the two must be subordinated to freedom, \u201ca value worth dying for.\u201d\n\nWatch Michoel Green discuss COVID-19 vaccine mandates and medical tyranny with \u201cThe Sentinel Report\u201d host Alex Newman below.\n\nThis video is from The New American channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nHolocaust survivor implores Westerners to \u2018wake up\u2019 and \u2018resist\u2019 ongoing tyranny in alleged \u2018democratic\u2019 countries.\n\n\u2018Resist, wake up, stop obeying\u2019: Holocaust survivor draws parallels in current society to Nazi Germany.\n\nHolocaust survivor says the time to resist is now: \u201cNever again\u201d applies to covid tyranny.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-02-07 10:28:21", "title": "Some things never change: Documentary reveals similarities between 1930s pre-Holocaust and 2020s COVID propaganda", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-02-06-documentary-reveals-similarities-pre-holocaust-covid-propaganda.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "A documentary film revealed similarities between pre-Holocaust propaganda during the 1930s and Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) propaganda during the 2020s.
