Any such attack, however, would first follow a series of psychological operations currently underway designed to destabilize Ukraine and undermine its ability to fight, said Budanov, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cThey want to foment unrest, through protests and meetings, that show the people are against the government,\u201d he said. Those efforts include ongoing anti-COVID-19 vaccination protests that Budanov said have been organized by Russia, which is also trying to stoke unrest related to the economy and energy supplies.\n\nThat\u2019s right. According to the Ukrainian military intelligence chief, resistance to vaccine compulsion in Ukraine is actually organized by the Kremlin, as a prelude to an imminent military offensive.\n\n\u201cThey want to foment\u2026protests\u2026that show the people are against the government\u201d these \u201cpsychological operations\u201d are \u201ccurrently underway\u201d.\n\nOf all the governments out there demonizing vaccine compulsion resistors, the Ukrainians take the cake. Trying to delegitimize resistors as agents of your neighbor\u2019s military power is certainly a new one.\n\nWhile the idea of Russian tanks rolling in to free the uninjected from vaccine coercion is an intriguing one, such liberalization would not follow in the wake of Russian tanks. For that premise to be credible the armor would have to be Belarusian.", "opengraph": {"title": "Ukraine\u2019s Military Intelligence Claims Resistance to Vaccine Sharia Is Organized by Russia to Legitimize Imminent Invasion", "description": "\u201cThey want to...show the people are against the government\u201d", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/ukraines-military-intelligence-claims-resistance-to-vaccine-sharia-is-organized-by-russia-to-legitimize-imminent-invasion/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/c95a7d84e0cf44e097445e873109b1e2-750x500.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-11-21T16:24:48+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-21T16:26:53+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/c95a7d84e0cf44e097445e873109b1e2.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-11-21T16:26:53+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2021/11/20/russia-preparing-to-attack-ukraine-by-late-january-ukraine-defense-intelligence-agency-chief/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-11-21T16:24:48+01:00"}
