UK-controlling subsidiary holdings under his Investec PLC umbrella. On Feb. 23, 2018 Malloch-Brown resigned as a longtime director at the same time that his Investec turned on a dime and implement Temenos as its sole banking service provider worldwide. Magically, they did it in 4 months (impossible unless it was already implemented). Such conversions normally take years to accomplish, not a few months!\n\nTemenos has operations across China, thus opening the Investec (already)-interlocking relationships to the Chinese globally. Prior to that Investec, through subsidiaries, was already supplying Chinese banks with their enterprise software.\n\nAfter twenty years of licensing its own banking software developed in the UK, Investec suddenly shifted its entire customer software offering to TEMENOS AG software that is notoriously known to use IBM infrastructure and AWS \u201ccloud\u201d servers. AWS also handles all financial reporting for UK Companies House. (Note: IBM notoriously stole the software for the invention of social networking from Columbus, Ohio innovator Leader Technologies, Inc.). Therefore, this entire Temenos ecosystem is a FRAUD.\n\nThrough the partnership, Temenos will make its cloud-native core banking solution available on the Huawei Public Cloud.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Mark Malloch-Brown and Control of Global Banking with Temenos", "url": "https://patriots4truth.org/2022/02/02/mark-malloch-brown-and-control-of-global-banking-with-temenos/", "description": "British Pilgrims Society principal, Baron Mark Malloch-Brown, is the poster child for the global corporate shell game.
