He said in an interview that physicians report \u201cseeing the weirdest cancers, and cancers that we have been able to keep in check and treat, taking off like wildfire \u2013 going stage 2, stage 3, stage 4, just like that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a professor at MIT has coauthored a paper that found a 25% increase in heart attack emergency calls among young Israelis after the country\u2019s mRNA vaccine rollout.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Corona Virus", "vaccine", "Diseases"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://dailysceptic.org/2022/11/26/as-an-oncologist-i-am-seeing-people-with-stable-cancer-rapidly-progress-after-being-forced-to-have-a-booster/", "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/09/researchers-report-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-cancers/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10928-z?ref=tjournal.ru&error=cookies_not_supported&code=9d4d04e1-10e0-450c-b4f2-e450efc00b64"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "December 11, 2022"}
