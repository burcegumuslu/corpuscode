Because the child had not been vaccinated, the doctor feared he might have meningitis and ordered the parents to take him to the emergency room.\n\nShortly after leaving the doctor\u2019s office Beck says her son started feeling better.\n\n\u201cHe was acting normal,\u201d she told Inside Edition. \u201cHis temperature was 102.\u201d\n\nSo she decided not to take him to the ER, in part because she was afraid of how they would react to him not being vaccinated, according to CNN.\n\nAfter she put her sick kids to bed later that night, she was in for a rude awakening:\n\nWhen the doctor found out they never made it to the ER, she called the Department of Children\u2019s Services, who called the Chandler police department, who came and attempted to check on the child.\n\nFrightened, the parents did not let them in, and instead spoke to the police through windows and by phone.\n\n\u201cAs I was on the phone with the police officer, I checked his temperature. It was 100 degrees. There\u2019s no reason for me to give up my kid because he has a temperature of 100 degrees.\u201d\n\nLater that night, after obtaining a warrant, a SWAT team came back, kicked in the door, guns drawn, and removed the 2-year-old boy and his two sisters, age 4 and 6, who had also sick and vomiting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the type of stuff you see when there\u2019s a hostage shootout, violent criminals, the cartel, not when a child has a fever,\u201d the family\u2019s attorney Nicolas Boca said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night. The children are sleeping. They\u2019ve already had a day where they had to go to the doctor. They wanted to rest.\u201d\n\nState representative Kelly Townsend, who helped pass legislation requiring DCS to get a search warrant before removing children from a home in a non-emergency situation, is troubled by the video.\n\nShe never expected the legislation to be used like this, she tells ABC News.\n\n\u201cThe doctor chose to use DCS to remove the child, and DCS chose to use the police, and the police chose to use the SWAT team,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not the country that I recognize.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that point, who now owns control over the child? It seems like we\u2019ve now given that to the doctor, and the parent no longer has a say or they risk the SWAT team taking all of the children and potentially the newborn.\u201d\n\nThe children are now in the temporary custody of their grandparents until the matter is settled in court.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "SWAT Team Breaks Into Family Home to \"Rescue,\" AKA Kidnap, Toddler With a Fever", "description": "Lawmaker says CPS has gone \u201ctoo far,\u201d knocking down family\u2019s\u00a0 door with guns drawn because parents didn\u2019t take toddler with fever to the emergency room after doctor\u2019s visit An Arizona lawmaker is calling for an investigation of child protective services, after a SWAT team kicked down a family\u2019s door with guns drawn to remove three [\u2026]", "url": "https://returntonow.net/2019/03/29/swat-team-raids-home-to-rescue-aka-kidnap-toddler-with-a-fever/", "site_name": "Return to Now", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/returntonow.net/", "article:published_time": "2019-03-29T21:44:42+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-03-30T14:26:21+00:00", "image": "https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWAT-x-Fever-1.jpg", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "563", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Uncategorized"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "400", "height": "200", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i398OApFApw\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/i398OApFApw"}], "links": ["https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/03/28/us/arizona-police-toddler-with-fever/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F", "https://abc7.com/swat-team-with-guns-drawn-raids-home-for-toddler-with-fever/5220780/?fbclid=IwAR35AXhMy7wlGjY-FuzihVsj9s1UoZy6saHYMznYLEoU1DvTrg8Bgk0vNcI"], "authors": ["Sara Burrows"], "publish_date": "2019-03-29T21:44:42+00:00"}
