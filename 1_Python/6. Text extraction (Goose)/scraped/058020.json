I am not a BIPOC student but was wondering if I would still be able to attend?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we do need to keep this space speci?c to BIPOC folks \u2026 Hopefully you\u2019ll be able to catch another one either during Winter break and/or next semester,\u201d the USF Counseling Center responded to Davis, according to Campus Reform.\n\nAfter he got the response, Davis filed a complaint with USF\u2019S Office of Compliance & Ethics on Oct. 5, 2022. But he did not get a response from the office until Feb. 8 of this year. Campus Reform noted:\n\nAccording to Davis, during an Oct. 18 Microsoft Teams information-gathering meeting regarding this issue, Equal Opportunity Officer Kenneth Thomas \u201cwas accusatory\u201d and \u201casked me if I even knew what BIPOC meant and if I understood the importance of those groups having their own discussion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did not seem concerned about my complaint and was more worried about the University\u2019s ability to continue these groups,\u201d Davis told the outlet.\n\nWhen the office finally did respond early last month, it said: \u201cThe Counseling Center will not prohibit any category of student [from] participating in specialized counseling groups unless specific exception, or a medical mandate is identified that may support exclusivity.\u201d\n\nRecently, Campus Reform also reported on conservative activist Chris Rufo\u2019s investigations into the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives at USF. His findings highlight how deeply this ideology has penetrated the Florida school. One document unearthed in his probe said: \u201cKnowledge about the ongoing history of institutionalized, structural racism and white supremacy and their interactions with other forms of oppression is critical to building a just, equitable, and democratic future for the United States.\u201d\n\nThe University of South Florida has adopted a radical \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d (DEI) program that claims America is a force for \u201cwhite supremacy,\u201d encourages students to attend racially segregated counseling programs to address their \u201cprivilege\u201d and \u201coppression,\u201d and promotes a variety of left-wing causes, including \u201creparations,\u201d \u201cdefund the police,\u201d and \u201cprison abolition.\u201d\n\nI have obtained a trove of public documents exposing the university\u2019s DEI programming, much of which, according to the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, the university tried to delete from its website following Florida governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s recent request for information on DEI in the state\u2019s public universities.\n\nThese materials, when viewed together, present a concerning picture of USF\u2019s diversity bureaucracy. The institution has adopted a left-leaning approach to race, creating a new standard of orthodoxy and implementing a policy of racial preference and discrimination, he noted further. It categorizes individuals as either oppressors or the oppressed, promoting \u201canti-racism\u201d as the solution and advocating for \u201cracial identity development,\u201d which, in practice, resembles a form of cult programming, as the required method of atonement.\n\nThe initial stage of this programming involves denouncing American society. After the death of George Floyd in 2020, virtually every aspect of USF publicly criticized the United States as inherently racist, Rufo noted.\n\nIt only got worse \u2014 and more anti-white racist \u2014 from there.", "opengraph": {"title": "White student denied access to mental health care at Florida university because he wasn\u2019t a \u2018person of color\u2019: Emails", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2023-03-06-white-student-denied-access-mental-health-care.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "Once again, far-left people of color who vote for Democrats are demonstrating their anti-white hatred, bigotry, and racism on a college campus.
