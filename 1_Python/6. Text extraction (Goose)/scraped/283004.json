They\u2019ve also added a billable ICD code for \u201cvaccine safety counseling\u201d\n\nAs recently discovered and reported by Dr. Robert Malone,1 the U.S. government has secretly been tracking those who didn\u2019t get the COVID jab, or are only partially jabbed, through a previously unknown surveillance program designed by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe program was implemented April 1, 2022,2 but didn\u2019t become universally adopted by most medical clinics and hospitals across the U.S. until January 2023.\n\nUnder this program, doctors at clinics and hospitals have been instructed to ask patients about their vaccination status, which is then added to their electronic medical records as a diagnostic code, known as ICD-10 code, without their knowledge or consent so that they can be tracked \u2014 not just within the health care system but outside of it as well.\n\nThe new International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were introduced during the September 14-15, 2021, ICD-10 Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting. The ICD committee includes representatives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the NCHS.3\n\nBelow is a screenshot of page 194 of the agenda4 distributed during that meeting. According to the NCHS, \u201cthere is interest in being able to track people who are not immunized or only partially immunized,\u201d and they figured out a way to do just that, by adding new ICD-10 codes.\n\nAs you can see below, ICD-10 code Z28.310 identifies those who have not received a COVID jab and Z28.311 identifies those who are not up-to-date on their shots.\n\nTracking Unjabbed Is Part of the Biosecurity Agenda\n\nWhy do they want to track the unvaccinated? For what purpose? The short answer: to facilitate the implementation of vaccine passports. As noted by Malone:5\n\u2022 The government will not restrict your travel, airlines will.\n\u2022 The government will not restrict your travel, other nations will.\n\u2022 The government will not restrict your travel, auto rental companies will.\n\u2022 The government will not restrict your travel, public transport will.\n\u2022 The government will not restrict your travel, private companies will.\u201d\n\nThe ICD codes were created by the World Health Organization, and doctors \u2014 with the exception of those in private practice who don\u2019t accept insurance \u2014 are required to use these codes to describe a patient\u2019s condition and the care they received during their visit.\n\nAs noted by Malone,7 the fact that the ICD system is run by the WHO is an important detail, as this means the WHO had to authorize the CDC to add these new codes. The implication is that these codes may be in use internationally and we just don\u2019t know it yet.\n\nThe codes are entered into your electronic health record and used by insurance companies for billing purposes. They\u2019re also used by statisticians who track and analyze national and global disease trends such as cancer and heart disease rates over time.\n\nOver the past decade, these statistical analyses have gotten easier to do, thanks to the transition into electronic record keeping. In the U.S., the ICD coding system has been fully integrated into the electronic health record system since 2012.\n\nWithin the ICD-10 codes, there\u2019s a category called ICD-10-CM,8,9 and this is the category the CDC is now using to track the unvaccinated with specific codes for \u201cUnvaccinated for COVID-19\u201d10 and \u201cPartially Vaccinated For COVID-19.\u201d11\n\nSince there\u2019s no billing or payment involved with being unvaccinated, and since being unvaccinated is extremely unlikely to be part of your disease profile, there\u2019s no valid reason to record anyone\u2019s vaccine refusal. It\u2019s also a violation of medical privacy, as the records can be accessed by a variety of individuals and not just your personal doctors.\n\nAs noted by Malone, a person\u2019s decision to get a vaccine or not is a private matter, and your privacy rights are enshrined in the Privacy Act of 1974. However, during the COVID pandemic, medical privacy rights have been repeatedly violated and broken.\n\nChildren\u2019s\u2019 vaccination statuses were shared with schools and employers were granted the \u201cright\u201d to know the jab status of their employees. Private venues were even permitted to demand proof of vaccination status \u2014 all this without a single word of the law having been revoked or amended.\n\nIf you need proof that these codes will be used for reasons unrelated to your health, consider this: They\u2019re also using codes to describe WHY you didn\u2019t get the primary series or stopped getting boosters. Those codes are listed in the screenshot below, under Z28.3 Underimmunization Status.12\n\nThe use of \u201cdelinquent immunization status\u201d under code Z28.39 also tells us something about where this is all headed. \u201cDelinquent\u201d means being \u201cneglectful of a duty\u201d or being \u201cguilty of an offense.\u201d Is refusing boosters a criminal offense? Perhaps not today, but some day, it probably will be.\n\nAll Missed Vaccinations Will Be Tracked\n\nAnother tipoff that these codes are part and parcel of the biosecurity control grid is the fact that code Z28.39 \u2014 \u201cOther underimmunization status\u201d13 \u2014 is to be used \u201cwhen a patient is not current on other, non-COVID vaccines.\u201d As detailed on the American Academy of Family Physicians website:14\n\n\u201cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have announced three new diagnosis codes, including two for COVID-19 immunization status \u2026\n\nAccording to ICD-10-CM guidelines,15 clinicians may assign code Z28.310, \u2018Unvaccinated for COVID-19,\u2019 when the patient has not received a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nClinicians may assign code Z28.311, \u2018Partially vaccinated for COVID-19,\u2019 when the patient has received at least one dose of a multi-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimen, but has not received the doses necessary to meet the CDC definition of \u2018fully vaccinated\u2019 at the time of the encounter \u2026 New code Z28.39 is for reporting when a patient is not current on other, non-COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\nIn other words, they have already begun tracking ALL of your vaccinations, not just the COVID shot, and they can use the Z28.3 sub-codes to identify why you refused a given vaccine.\n\nVaccine Passports Are a Fait Accompli \u2014 Unless We Act Now\n\n\u201cThe administrative state is busy building a vaccine passport system that will be active before most Americans are aware of what is being done to them. No one is going to knock on your door asking for your vaccine status because they already know \u2026\n\nThey don\u2019t need approval from Congress or the courts because we have given them the information through our health care providers. The CDC is the governmental organization tasked with tracking vaccine status on individuals.\n\nThey already have the records, as well as updated booster information. They just need to tweak a definition here and there, or get President Biden to keep the COVID-19 public health emergency in place indefinitely and the vaccine passports will be a fait accompli.\u201d\n\nYou Can Now Be Billed for Immunization Safety Counseling\n\nAs if all of that weren\u2019t tyrannical enough, they\u2019ve also added a billable ICD-10 code for \u201cimmunization safety counseling.\u201d That\u2019s right. If you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re not willing to partake in the mRNA experiment, or you just don\u2019t think you need some other vaccine that\u2019s recommended, your doctor can bill your insurance for regurgitating the WHO\u2019s vaccine propaganda.\n\nThis may become more or less automatic because, again, they have codes identifying whether you declined the COVID jab and/or any other vaccine, and for each vaccine refusal, there\u2019s a code detailing why you declined it. \u201cBelief or group pressure\u201d is one of those, and you can bet that code, Z.28.1, will automatically qualify you for immunization safety counseling, whether you want it or not.\n\nThey also intend to indoctrinate your children, and make you pay for it. The immunization safety counseling code, Z71.85, was described in the September 2021 issue of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Pediatric Coding Newsletter. You have to be a member to read the entire article, but here\u2019s the publicly available preview:17\n\nAs physicians and other qualified health care professionals field increasing numbers of concerns about immunization safety, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) offers a new code, Z71.85, for identifying immunization safety counseling as a reason for an encounter provided on or after October 1, 2021.\n\nUse this code when reporting counseling provided to patients and caregivers who are vaccine hesitant, wish to follow an alternative immunization schedule, or otherwise require time spent in counseling at lengths beyond that typical of routine immunization counseling.\n\nCode Z71.85 may be reported to indicate the principal or first-listed reason for an encounter or as a secondary reason.\n\nDocumentation of time spent in preventive medicine counseling and separate time spent in immunization administration counseling should be explicit in the encounter note to support that the preventive medicine counseling was significant and separately identifiable.\u201d\n\nIn related news, in early February 2023 it was revealed that New York City teachers who did not get the jab were \u201cflagged\u201d with a \u201cproblem code\u201d in their personnel files, triggering their fingerprints to be sent to the FBI and the New York Criminal Justice Services.18\n\nThe purpose of this is unclear, but former public school teacher Michael Kane, founder of Teachers for Choice, believes \u201cthat unvaccinated NYC educators were being set up to be viewed as \u2018right-wing extremists\u2019 or even \u2018terrorists.\u2019\u201d\n\nKane was among those who got fired for refusing the COVID jab. The revelation that teachers\u2019 fingerprints were illegally entered into not just one, but two, criminal databases \u201care certain to open up a new round of lawsuits,\u201d Kane writes.\n\nKnowing all of this, what can you do about it? How do we stop this madness? Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Demand Congress finish what the Senate started by declaring the public health emergency over and done with. January 17, 2023, HR 382, a bill \u201cTo terminate the public health emergency declared with respect to COVID-19\u201d was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. This bill must be passed.\n\n2. Contact your Congressional representative and let them know you:\n\u2022 Support the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government\u2019s investigation.\n\u2022 Want Congress to reject all attempts by the administrative state, the United Nations, the WHO, Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Biden Administration to require a vaccine passport or a digital ID.\n\u2022 Expect them to work to ensure the freedom of travel for all citizens.\n\u2022 Expect them to protect all rights to privacy, including and especially medical privacy, and since these new ICD-10 codes are in violation of your right to privacy, you want them to take immediate action to ensure the codes are revoked.\n\nWith respect to what you can do to protect your medical privacy on a personal level, keep in mind that independent doctors are not required to use ICD codes unless they accept insurance. So, by choosing a doctor who is in private practice, you can avoid getting tagged and trapped in the system.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Unvaccinated Or Partially Vaccinated?
