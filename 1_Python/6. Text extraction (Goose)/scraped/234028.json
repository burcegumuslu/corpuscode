But the censorship of Malone goes even further than that. As reported in the video above, Malone\u2019s scientific accomplishments are also being scrubbed.\n\nAs recently as June 14, 2021, Malone\u2019s contributions were extensively included in the historical section on RNA vaccines\u2019 Wikipedia page. He was listed as having co-developed a \u201chigh-efficiency in-vitro and in-vivo RNA transfection system using cationic liposomes\u201d in 1989.\n\nIn 1990, he demonstrated that \u201cin-vitro transcribed mRNA could deliver genetic information into the cell to produce proteins within living cell tissue.\u201d Malone was also part of the team that conducted the first mRNA vaccine experiments. In short, his scientific knowledge of mRNA vaccines is unquestionable.\n\nTwo days later, June 16, 2021, just five days after Malone\u2019s appearance on the DarkHorse podcast, his name was removed from the Wikipedia entry. Now, all of a sudden, the discovery of mRNA drug delivery is accredited to nameless researchers at the Salk Institute and the University of California, and his 1990 research confirming that injected mRNA can produce proteins in cell tissue is accredited to nameless scientists at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nHungarian biochemist Katalin Kariko is now suddenly praised by mainstream media as the inventor of mRNA vaccines.2 It\u2019s a convenient choice, considering Kariko is the senior vice president of BioNTech, the creator of Pfizer\u2019s COVID injection. Kariko\u2019s unofficial biography also includes being a communist-era police informant.\n\nAs noted in the featured video, this goes beyond censoring. It\u2019s revisionism \u2014 a \u201c1984\u201d-style rewriting of history to fit the official narrative of the day. The danger of this trend is incalculable.\n\nWhat Did Malone Say About mRNA Vaccines?\n\nThe take-home messages Malone delivered on Weinstein\u2019s podcast were that government is not being transparent about the risks, that no one should be forced to take these experimental injections, that the risks outweigh the benefits in children, teens and young adults, and that those who have recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection should not get the injection. In a June 24, 2021, interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News (above), Malone said:3\n\nA significant part of why we don\u2019t have adequate data is because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration purposely decided not to require stringent post-vaccination data collection and evaluation. This too was revealed in Malone\u2019s DarkHorse interview.\n\nWhy did the FDA opt for lax data capture on a brand-new, never before used technology slated for mass distribution? Clearly, without post-injection data capture, there\u2019s no way to evaluate the safety of these products. You cannot identify danger signals if you don\u2019t have a process for capturing effects data and evaluating all of it.\n\nMalone also points out that risk-benefit analyses have not been done, and that\u2019s another objection he has. What data we do have, however, indicate these COVID-19 injections could be the most dangerous medical product we\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nFor example, the reported rate of death from COVID-19 shots now exceeds the reported death rate of more than 70 vaccines combined over the past 30 years, and it\u2019s about 500 times deadlier than the seasonal flu vaccine,4 which historically has been the most hazardous. The COVID shots are also seven times more dangerous than the pandemic H1N1 vaccine, which had a 25-per-million severe side effect rate.5\n\nCoincidentally, a peer-reviewed risk-benefit analysis6 was in fact published in the medical journal Vaccines the same day Malone spoke to Carlson. It revealed that the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) to prevent one COVID-19 death using the Pfizer injection is between 9,000 and 50,000, and that for every three COVID-19 deaths prevented, two are killed by the injection. According to the authors, \u201cThis lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "mRNA Vaccine Inventor Erased From History Books", "description": "June 11, 2021, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology,1\u00a0Dr. Robert Malone, spoke out on the DarkHorse podcast about the potential dangers of COVID-19 gene therapy\u00a0injections, hosted by Bret Weinstein, Ph.D. The podcast was quickly erased from YouTube and Weinstein was issued a warning.To censor a scientific discussion with the", "url": "https://organicconsumers.org/mrna-vaccine-inventor-erased-history-books/", "site_name": "Organic Consumers", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/organicconsumers", "article:published_time": "2021-07-12T14:42:14+00:00", "image": "https://organicconsumers.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/malone.png", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["//articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/07/06/mrna-vaccine-inventor-erased-from-history-books.aspx\" target=\"oca-linked\">Read the Full Article</a>", "https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/06/21/mrna-inventor-interviewed-about-injection-dangers.aspx", "https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/02/09/coronavirus-mrna-vaccine.aspx", "https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/02/20/brave-new-world.aspx"], "authors": ["OCA"], "publish_date": "2021-07-12T14:42:14+00:00"}
