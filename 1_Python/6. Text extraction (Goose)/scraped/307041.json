Bild revealed the details in an exclusive report published January 25.\n\nOn June 2, 2020, the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (bmi) and the German Federal Press Office summoned the top lobbyists from Google and Facebook for confidential talks. The topic of the summit: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic and the spread of misinformation, false information and disinformation observed in this context.\u201d The aim of the meeting was to clarify \u201chow the associated challenge can be fundamentally countered.\u201d\n\n \u2014Bild\n\nWhat happened next: We do not know what exactly was agreed on in the meetings. But we do know what happened next: Social networks deleted disagreeable posts and videos by citizens, artists and even scientists because they were allegedly \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nFake news became reality: In a follow-up report, Bild noted, \u201cTime and again, the government and social networks declared certain facts or opinions to be \u2018false reports\u2019 or \u2018conspiracy theories,\u2019 but subsequently had to concede their positions. Either because the supposed false reports became reality\u2014or because at least serious circumstantial evidence emerged that could not be ignored.\u201d\n\nVaccine funding: At the same time, as Fortune noted, Germany funded the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine through its partner BioNTech, a German biotechnology company. The European Commission ordered millions of vaccine doses\u2014paid for by taxpayers\u2019 money who were withheld critical information about the virus and the vaccine.\n\nConflict of interest? If the same entity is behind furthering the development of a vaccine and controlling information about the disease, this would constitute a serious conflict of interest (read: \u201cRunning on \u2018COVID Money\u2019\u201d).\n\nControlling speech: There is more we need to understand about Germany\u2019s desire to control what is being said on the Internet. These recent events point to Germany\u2019s long history of suppressing freedom of information and to prophecies about Germany\u2019s rise in the end time.
