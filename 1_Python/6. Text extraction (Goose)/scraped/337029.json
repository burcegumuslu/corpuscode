And to no small sum, mind you. His investments in pharmaceutical and health companies is at $100,000 while it is also being alleged that he has received more than $400,000 from the same interest groups. Hannon\u2019s investments are a direct conflict of interest and he should be charged criminally. This is an act of using your position to influence and write laws for the sole result of personal gain.\n\nSen. Kemp Hannon (R-Nassau County) in 2014 invested in 14 companies that would fall under his committee\u2019s purview. By comparison, Assembly Health Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan) did not report owning any stock in health-related companies. In addition to his investments, Hannon over the past four years also received more than $420,000 from pharmaceutical and other medical interests, records show. Hannon\u2019s office had no comment. On the part of his 2014 state financial disclosure form dealing with investments, he wrote that sales and purchases were \u201cat sole discretion of the broker.\u201d\n\nIf you are representing the interest of the people (which you are if your job title is \u201cSenator), then you have no excuse for this activity. You can\u2019t blame a broker, you know your investments. And even if the broker was given full reign over your financial activity, how could you not explain which investment interest would be direct conflicts with your interest in \u201chelping the people?\u201d This is an excuse and it doesn\u2019t hold water. These investments prove he has a personal interest in passing these laws and that can\u2019t be right. Of course, the caveat is that it is likely technically legal (that\u2019s the crony aspect of politics at work for you).\n\nBack in March, Hannon also secured $65,000 for a hospital with ties to his private firm, again according to the New York Daily News.\n\nSen. Kemp Hannon (R-Nassau County) sponsored a $30,000 state grant in 2007-08 to Winthrop University Hospital on Long Island, according to state records posted online. The money was to help the hospital continue with outreach programs, according to the records. In 2008-09, Hannon sponsored another $35,000 grant to the hospital that was for \u201ccommunity health,\u201d records show. Two other grants, totaling $20,000, went to an organization that was working with Winthrop pediatric residents. In addition to being a senator since 1989, Hannon since the mid 1980s has been a \u201cspecial counsel\u201d with the Long Island-based Farrell Fritz PC . The firm has represented Winthrop University Hospital in cases dating back to 1993, and had cases at the time Hannon secured the two grants. In addition, the firm\u2019s managing partner, Charles Strain. has served as the unpaid chairman the hospital\u2019s board of directors.\n\nHannon rules the health care industry in New York with a greedy iron fist, without fear of any consequences or repercussions. This is a complete failure of the system, but of course, not completely uncommon.\n\nPlease put the pressure on by sharing this article and spread the word. No matter how you may or may not feel about vaccines, this is utterly sickening. We can\u2019t allow pharmaceuticals to rule our entire health care system via bribing legislation.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mw41e0.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: Author Of Mandatory Meningitis Vaccine Bill Caught Taking $420k From Big Pharma", "url": "https://anonhq.com/breaking-author-of-mandatory-meningitis-vaccine-bill-caught-taking-420k-from-big-pharma/", "site_name": "AnonHQ", "article:published_time": "2015-12-13T20:47:08+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2015-12-13T20:47:23+00:00", "image:width": "650", "image:height": "280", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.me/armyanonymous", "https://anonhq.com/support-us/", "http://vaxxter.com/index.php/author/helenSco/", "http://vaxxter.com/index.php/2015/12/02/mandatory-meningitis-vaccine-bill-author-kemp-hannon-caught-taking-420k-from-pharma/", "http://www.trueactivist.com/breaking-author-of-mandatory-meningitis-vaccine-bill-caught-taking-420k-from-big-pharma/", "http://www.trueactivist.com/worlds-first-malaria-vaccine-approved-to-be-dispersed-not-for-profit/", "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/lovett-heath-pol-big-money-drug-firms-article-1.2449907", "http://www.trueactivist.com/phd-doctor-has-this-to-say-about-the-controversial-hpv-vaccine/", "http://www.trueactivist.com/researchers-accidentally-discover-that-orange-peels-can-suck-mercury-from-polluted-water/", "http://www.trueactivist.com/courts-quietly-confirm-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism/", "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-sen-hannon-secured-65g-hospital-tied-firm-article-1.2155999", "http://www.trueactivist.com/cardiologist-says-dont-vaccinate-amid-recent-vaccine-hysteria/", "http://www.trueactivist.com/new-birth-control-for-pets-will-make-spaying-and-neutering-unnecessary/", "http://www.trueactivist.com/researchers-accidentally-discover-that-orange-peels-can-suck-mercury-from-polluted-water/", "https://www.patreon.com/armyanonymous\n", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10=", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10="], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2015-12-13T20:47:08+00:00"}
