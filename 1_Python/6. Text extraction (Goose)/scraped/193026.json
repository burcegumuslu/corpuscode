Chilly and feverish. Headache-y. Nauseated. Or your arm just hurt. These are all possible side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe talk surrounding side effects is that these are all good things \u2014 and may be a sign that your immune system is ramping up and ready to take on the virus that causes COVID-19 should it encounter it in the future.\n\nWhile vaccine side effects, in general, are mild and short-lasting, can their presence tell you anything else about what's going on in your body? We talked to an infectious disease expert to find out what it all means.\n\n\"Side effects occur either because your body's immune system is reacting to the vaccine itself or a component of that vaccine,\" Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner, MD, infectious disease specialist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston, tells LIVESTRONG.com. \"We don't know if it's your body making the antibodies or if your body is reacting to one of the lipids or preservatives in the vaccine.\"\n\nOne of the cool things that's come out of recent research is that people who have had COVID-19 may have a more robust reaction to the first dose of the vaccine (if you're getting the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna).\n\n\"Research is ongoing, but one dose may be enough to boost the body's own natural immune system in people who have had past COVID-19 infections,\" Dr. Ostrosky-Zeichner says. (One recent study on this was published in April 2021 in \u200bScience Immunology\u200b.)\n\nIn that event, your immune system may be primed to respond to the vaccine and you may be saddled with stronger side effects, suggests preliminary research on the mRNA vaccines. (This study was not peer-reviewed, so more research is needed.)\n\nWhat's more, people assigned female at birth (AFAB) may respond differently than people assigned male at birth (AMAB). Notably, people AFAB made up the majority of the anaphylactic reactions in the most recent data available on the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, published in \u200bJAMA Insights\u200b.\n\nAnd that's not unique to the COVID vaccine. People AFAB typically have a more robust immune response. In fact, a December 2013 study in \u200bVaccine\u200b found that four times as many women as men (that's the language the study used) ages 20 to 59 reported allergic reactions after getting the 2009 flu vaccine, even though more men got that shot.\n\nIt's not totally clear why this is the case, but it may have something to do with genetics or the way sex hormones affect the immune response. In the case of the COVID shot, it could also have to do with how the vaccine is broken down in the body.\n\nIn general, people tend to have a more robust reaction to the second vaccine dose, Dr. Ostrosky-Zeichner says. That said, if you had side effects from your first shot, it doesn't mean you'll definitely react to the second. Still, prepare yourself anyway.\n\nFor example, if you suspect you had COVID before, got your first Moderna or Pfizer dose and were stuck in bed all day afterward feeling ill, you can't assume you're now totally protected. Stick to the CDC's guidelines about what to do when you're fully vaccinated, get your second dose (if applicable) and ask your doctor if you have any questions about whether or not certain activities following vaccination are OK for you.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Here's what we know about the meaning behind side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, including what it says about your immune response and history with COVID.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764468-covid-vaccine-side-effects-meaning/", "title": "5 Things to Know if You Had Side Effects From the COVID Vaccine | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2F0b0a60b1bdfe40aeb6325273902e3bee.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725963-what-is-immune-system/", "/article/13764469-no-covid-vaccine-side-effects-meaning/", "/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "/article/13731521-covid-vaccine-facts/", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "https://med.uth.edu/internalmedicine/faculty/luis-ostrosky-zeichner-md/", "/article/13764469-no-covid-vaccine-side-effects-meaning/", "/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "/article/13731521-covid-vaccine-facts/", "https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/58/eabi6950", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250653v1", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776557", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1301342X", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/132353-a-constant-feeling-anxiety/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764251-which-arm-to-get-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763718-covid-vaccine-guilt/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764018-foods-to-eat-after-vaccine/"], "authors": ["Jessica Migala"], "publish_date": null}
