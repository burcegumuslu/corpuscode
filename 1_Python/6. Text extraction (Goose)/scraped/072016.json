Kathy Hochul mandated the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to \u201ctake major regulatory action that will require all new passenger cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in New York state to be zero emissions by 2035.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a crucial regulatory step to achieving significant greenhouse gas emission reductions from the transportation sector and is complemented by new and ongoing investments \u2026 including electric vehicle infrastructure progress, zero-emission vehicle incentives and ensuring New York\u2019s communities benefit from historic federal climate change investments.\u201d\n\nThe effort is being supported by hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money. According to the Daily Wire, the Empire State will spend at least $250 million in federal dollars \u2013 with about $175 million earmarked toward the construction of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.\n\nHochul\u2019s order did not ban gasoline-powered vehicles in one fell swoop. Her mandate requires \u201can increasing percentage of new, light-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emission vehicles starting with 35 percent of sales by 2026, 67 percent of sales by 2030 and 100 percent of sales by 2035.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew pollutant standards for model year 2026 through model year 2034 passenger cars, light-duty truck and medium-duty vehicles with internal combustion engines would also be required.\u201d (Related: Barcelona to ban cars over 20 years old in effort to fight air pollution.)\n\nNew York\u2019s move follows that of the Golden State, whose chief executive Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a similar ban. The prohibitions were weaved in as an amendment to a 2020 executive order that sought to \u201cput the state on a path to carbon neutrality by 2045.\u201d\n\nThe California order also applied a progressive phase-out of gasoline-powered vehicles. From 12 percent in the current year, sales of electric vehicles will be increased to 35 percent in 2026. It will then be increased to 51 percent in 2028 and 68 percent in 2030, before reaching 100 percent in 2035.\n\nDuring the Sept. 29 press conference where Hochul announced the ban on gasoline-powered cars, she claimed that EVs have been in New York for \u201cover a hundred years.\u201d The Democratic governor added that car makers built EVs in order for wives to \u201chave some freedom [from] domestic servitude\u201d while their husbands were at work.\u201d Hochul added that EVs \u2018\u201dgave women the freedom to drive\u201d as their gasoline-powered counterparts were difficult to operate.\n\nDuggan Flanakin, a policy analyst with the free-market environmental advocacy group Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, denounced Hochul\u2019s new order. He argued that getting rid of gas-powered cars in New York state shows how the urban elites have \u201ccontempt\u201d for rural Americans.\n\n\u201cNone of this march away from reliable, proven [internal combustion engines] makes any sense to rural Americans, those who live in hurricane-prone areas and anyone who drives cross-country,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cFarmers today can run their tractors off biodiesel made right down the road, and drive to distant towns for groceries and supplies in their 20-year-old pickups. Hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural and human-caused disruptive events can shut down electric power for days in large areas.\u201d\n\nFlanakin ultimately issued this challenge: \u201cImagine if 200 million internal combustion engine vehicle owners \u2013 or even two million \u2013 decided to work together to fight against the outrageous, unworkable, anti-democratic and bankrupting mandates forcing everyone into EVs most cannot afford and do not want, and to effectively exclude billions from being allowed to drive at all.\u201d\n\nWatch Elijah Schaffer of Next News Network discuss New York state\u2019s impending ban on gasoline-powered cars.\n\nThis video is from the NewsClips channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nAll electric in 20 years?
