A Beijing-based immunologist, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Friday that the world should suspend the use of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine represented by Pfizer, as this new technology has not proven safety in large-scale use or in preventing any infectious diseases. Older people, especially those over 80, should not be recommended to receive any COVID-19 vaccine, he said.\n\nAll of which is a problem since it is the elderly who are at most risk (quite frankly at any real risk at all) and thus who need the protection the most. The Chinese health experts instead say that the most elderly and frail should be recommended to take medicines to improve their immune system.\n\nOf course, one cannot help but note the irony of scientists from the source of the plague that has killed millions around the world and destroyed lives/economies almost everywhere, is now calling for the cessation of the process to protect against the plague.\n\nAs we detailed earlier, Norway health authorities are reporting COVID-19 vaccine news of monumental importance at a moment the US is rushing to get an initial some 30 million doses into the arms of the elderly and those with chronic health conditions: sick patients over 80 are particularly at risk for devastating side effects.\n\nThus for this vulnerable demographic which is currently first in line in North America, the \u201ccure\u201d could be worse than the disease. Bloomberg notes that it\u2019s \u201cthe most cautious statement yet from a European health authority\u201d regarding potential adverse vaccine health risks.\n\nThe health authority said further in its most blunt statement cautioning against a policy of a blanket promotion of the vaccine for all:\n\nThis comes after a handful of global cases, including an elderly patient in France, where a recipient died within hours of receiving their first-round of the vaccine.\n\nThus far Norway says it has administered doses to up to 33,000 people, including the elderly, but are already finding it \u201ctoo risky\u201d for the terminally ill and people over 80 that are in frail condition. Given only 33,000 injected so far, the reported death count is already staggering and is causing officials to sound the alarm:\n\nBut despite the warnings being featured prominently at the end of this week in Bloomberg and multiple other mainstream publications, again we doubt this will do anything in terms of putting the brakes on the rushed vaccine rollout in the US where it\u2019s precisely the elderly, frail, and those prone to persistent health conditions that are being urged on by state and federal policies to be first in line.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg had this to say of the most common vaccine brands in Norway and the West:\n\nNorway initiated its COVID-19 vaccinations last month on the heels of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine receiving approval by the European Medicines Agency. Norway\u2019s infections are approaching 60,000 out of total population of 5.3 million, including over 500 deaths.\n\nMany skeptics in Europe and the US still have severe reservations about the vaccines, even as big pharma and governments continually insist they are completely safe.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Health Experts Call for Suspension of Pfizer Vaccination Among Elderly", "description": "Chinese health experts called on the world to suspend the use of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0produced by companies such as Pfizer.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/health-experts-call-for-suspension-of-pfizer-vaccination-among-elderly/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-01-15T23:24:28+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-01-15T23:30:57+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ufoiewufoieufiuew-600x315.png", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How many of these deaths came after the Pfizer vaccine?
