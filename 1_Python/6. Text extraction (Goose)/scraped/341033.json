Hyten, the outgoing Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warning this week that China\u2019s military progression is \u201cstunning\u201d and that the US must take immediate action to remain the world\u2019s preeminent superpower, with his stating: \u201cCalling China a pacing threat is a useful term because the pace at which China is moving is stunning...The pace they\u2019re moving and the trajectory they\u2019re on will surpass Russia and the United States if we don\u2019t do something to change it...It will happen\u201d.\n\nWith Biden provoking Russia while the US Air Force warns about China, the MoD war bulletins in this report note that America\u2019s most critical immediate conflict is with itself\u2014an internal conflict that, on 26 October, saw US Air Force Lieutenant-General Mary O\u2019Brien posting the message: \u201cI have \u201cbreakthrough\u201d COVID despite being fully vaccinated, with many symptoms\u2026102 fever, cough, congestion, fatigue, muscle aches...I'm also healthy, normal weight, exercise, eat right, never touched tobacco & wear my mask indoors...Breakthrough cases do not mean that COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u201d\u2014a message coming ahead of the 2 November deadline imposed by Biden for all US military forces to accept being jabbed with experimental Covid vaccines\u2014today sees over 12,000 US Air Force personnel having rejected orders to get fully vaccinated and will fail to meet this deadline\u2014further sees that recruits in the US Air Force training pipeline were recently forced out for refusing to get vaccinated\u2014this past week saw one tearful US Air Force solider refusing to be jabbed posting a video and stating: \u201cWe have no idea what to plan for\u201d\u2014though in factual reality, these over 12,000 soldiers are in willful violation of a lawful order and subject to discipline under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the maximum punishment for is dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and prison confinement for two years.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript note that in the waning years of the Soviet Union, soldiers and citizens refusing to follow orders or obey their despotic socialist overlords were branded \u201crefuseniks\u201d\u2014a term now rightly applied to soldiers in the US Army, which is America\u2019s largest military service, that has granted just one permanent medical exemption and no religious exemptions for experimental Covid vaccines\u2014a term now rightly applied to sailors in the US Navy, that plans to issue blanket rejections for ALL religious exemptions to the Covid vaccine mandate despite directly violating several Naval procedures\u2014and in what is being called \u201cBiden\u2019s Covid Nightmare\u201d, today it sees fully one-third of US Military forces refusing to be jabbed with experimental Covid vaccines.\n\nJoining these tens-of-thousands of US military \u201crefuseniks\u201d, this report continues, are the tens, if not hundreds-of-thousands of US government employees also refusing to be jabbed with experimental Covid vaccines, as just reported: \u201cSome agencies, such as the Bureau of Prisons, where only about half of employees were vaccinated as of early October, and the Transportation Security Administration, where the rate is just 60%, are still lagging behind national averages\u2026A union official recently estimated that between 10% and 20% of BOP\u2019s workforce would leave their jobs as a result of the mandate, while the TSA chief said the agency is \u201cbuilding contingency plans\u201d for a mass exodus of employees\u2026The Pentagon is butting heads with the Archbishop for the Military Services Timothy Broglio, who recently said no one should be forced to receive a COVID-19 vaccine\u2026Defense has affirmed that less than half of the department\u2019s 760,000 civilian employees have been vaccinated\u2026Most federal workers have until November 22 to be fully vaccinated\u201d\u2014and yesterday it saw National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd warning he stands to lose over 6,000 US Border agents that are refusing to be jabbed.\n\nWhile viewing this looming catastrophe, this report notes, yesterday it caused United States District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to issue a temporary restraining order that prevents both civilian and active-duty military plaintiffs from being terminated after they sued the Biden regime over religious exemptions to Covid experimental vaccines\u2014after which New York State Richmond County Supreme Court Judge Lizette Colon denied a request from a New York City police union to temporarily halt Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s order requiring all municipal employees, including law enforcement officials, to receive at least one dose of an experimental Covid vaccine by later this week or face unpaid leave\u2014a denial coming at the same time thousands of police and fire \u201crefuseniks\u201d protested throughout New York City with the rallying cry \u201cCoercion is not consent\u201d\u2014and to this very day, it sees the leftist American mainstream media maintaining their \u201cStriketober\u201d farce to keep hidden the thousands of \u201crefusenik\u201d protests occurring all throughout the United States.\n\nIn a shocking display proving beyond all doubt that socialist insanity now controls America instead of rational science, this report details, yesterday the American Geophysical Union\u2019s fellows program \u201crejected awards for five of their nation\u2019s top ice scientists because they were white men\u201d\u2014awards open to anyone, regardless of colour, whose rigorous scientific peer reviewed examination process allows only the top scientists to be accepted, but now sees the colour of ones skin being the main deciding factor\u2014though in viewing this socialist racist atrocity, it does explain why the idiots ruling America are failing to understand the significance of the massive Covid outbreak now occurring in Ireland where 91% of its population is vaccinated, while at the same time in Florida, whose vaccination rate is 59.5% of its population, today sees it having reached the lowest Covid case rate in America\u2014a striking difference between Ireland and Florida explained in articles kept hidden from the American people like \u201cConsensus REACHED: An Astounding 91 Clinical Research Studies ALL CONFIRMED That NATURAL IMMUNITY Provides Same, If Not Better Protection Against the Virus Than Covid-19 Vaccines \u2013 Infection Rate Remained at \u201cAlmost ZERO\u201d Among Previously Infected Individuals\u201d\u2014and in another major study just concluded by world renowned scientist Professor S.V. Subramanian Ph.D. at Harvard Universities T.H. Chan School of Public Health, these demonic Biden socialists are hiding his findings, that reveal:\n\n\u201cAt the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days.\n\nIn fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.\n\nNotably, with over 60% of their population fully vaccinated had the highest COVID-19 cases per 1 million people in the last 7 days.\n\nThe lack of a meaningful association between percentage population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases is further exemplified, for instance, by comparison of and .\n\nBoth countries have over 75% of their population fully vaccinated and have more COVID-19 cases per 1 million people than countries such as and that have around 10% of their population fully vaccinated.\u201d\n\nIn a country like the ruled over by demonic socialist tyranny instead of moral and rational science, this report concludes, it was no surprise this week to see surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Horak being fired after telling a local school board to let parents make decisions about masking their children\u2014nor was it surprising this week to see the socialist Democrat Party controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court condemning a Covid patient to death by refusing to allow him to be treated with the Nobel Prize winning lifesaving drug Ivermectin, and is the same lifesaving Ivermectin drug used to treat 200 members of the US Congress\u2014nor was it surprising this week to see famed cartoonist Michael Leunig being fired for his cartoon comparing Covid \u201crefuseniks\u201d to the Chinese citizens massacred in Tiananmen Square\u2014and most importantly to notice, it isn\u2019t surprising at all that the top socialist Covid authority in America is Dr. Anthony Fauci, who\u2019s most infamously known for deliberately killing helpless puppies.
