Heinrich also stated that the conclusions from Schofbeck\u2019s letter are \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\n\nAccording to some experts, however, insurance company data may ultimately prove to be the most telling when it comes to accuracy about adverse events and deaths from COVID vaccines \u2014 that\u2019s because insurers are highly motivated to carefully track any anomalies in their data that could profoundly affect their profits and losses.\n\nThe BKK data, in concert with U.S. insurance industry data and adverse event reports collected by a survey conducted by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH), reveal an emerging pattern of underreporting of COVID vaccine-related injuries and deaths.\n\nAccording to Schofbeck\u2019s Feb. 21 letter to the PEI:\n\u2022 According to physician billing data, 216,695 were treated for a vaccine AE during the first 2.5 quarters of 2021.\n\u2022 Figures extrapolated over an entire year for a population of 83 million people means that 2.5-3 million people likely received treatment for an AE.\n\u2022 4-5% of vaccinated people received treatment for an AE.\n\nIn his letter, Schofbeck speculated on possible causes for underreporting, stating:\n\n\u201cOur first assumption is that, since no compensation is paid for reporting vaccine adverse events, reporting to the Paul Ehrlich Institute is often not done because of the great expense involved. Physicians have reported to us that reporting a suspected vaccine adverse event takes about half an hour. This means that 3 million suspected cases of vaccine adverse events require about 1.5 million working hours of physicians.\u201d\n\nSchofbeck concluded the data present a \u201csignificant warning signal\u201d and that \u201cdanger to human life cannot be ruled out.\u201d\n\nAlthough the PEI publicly announced it would work with BKK to review the data, as of Schofbeck\u2019s termination from the company, authorities hadn\u2019t launched an investigation into Schofbeck\u2019s claims about underreporting.\n\nBefore the BKK data disappeared, Florian Schilling, a German researcher and physician, took a deeper look at it, comparing it to existing reports from the PEI.\n\u2022 PEI\u2019s reported numbers for 2021 were 7 times lower than BKK\u2019s calculations.\n\u2022 PEI\u2019s reported numbers were 13.86 times lower than BKK\u2019s projections when compared to the 14 month period since the vaccine rollout.\n\u2022 Using this factor, Schilling calculated more than 400,000 serious AEs and over 31,000 deaths from AEs have occurred since the beginning of the vaccination campaign.\n\nStatistician Matthew Crawford, who also reviewed Schofbeck\u2019s claims, calculated that with potentially 31,000 vaccine-related deaths in Germany \u2014 a country of 82 million \u2014 it follows that 120,000 vaccine-related deaths may have occurred in the U.S.\n\nHow could so many potentially fatal complications from COVID vaccines escape the attention of the CDC?\n\nAccording to Crawford, the CDC chose to identify risk by using an obscure computation called Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR). As the name implies, this system is based on ratios of different event types and is utterly blind to the absolute rate of such events.\n\nThe result of using such a formula is that even if a vaccine is associated with substantially higher risk of injury, no alarm will sound if the vaccine raises risks of different types uniformly, no matter to what degree.\n\nIn other words, if the risk of myocarditis from a Covid-19 vaccine is, for example, twenty times higher than from other vaccines, the PRR for myocarditis will not be any higher than with previous vaccines if other adverse events associated with the Covid-19 vaccine are also twenty times higher. No safety signal will be raised.\n\nMethods of extrapolating data, adverse event reporting categories and billing code descriptions will vary by country, agency and within the private sector, making direct comparisons difficult.\n\nHowever, a pattern of underreporting is evident.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://en-volve.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/covid-19-vaccine-678x381-1.png"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/german-insurance-fires-andreas-schofbeck-covid-vaccine-injuries-data/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Schofbeck_-letter-translated.pdf", "https://www.pei.de/EN/home/home-node.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Schofbeck_-letter-translated.pdf", "https://www.virchowbund.de/", "https://www.eugyppius.com/p/german-public-health-insurer-vaccine?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web&s=r", "https://www.virchowbund.de/pressemitteilungen/details/schwurbel-bkk-gibt-falschen-alarm-bei-impfnebenwirkungen", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/insurance-companies-report-increase-premature-deaths/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/booster-shots-more-injuries-israeli-survey/", "https://www.florianschillingscience.org/", "https://tkp-at.translate.goog/2022/02/22/abrechnungsdaten-der-krankenkassen-belegen-sicherheitsdesaster-der-gen-impfstoffe/?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp", "https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/vaccine-induced-mortality-part-9?s=r", "https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/estimating-vaccine-induced-mortality?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web&s=r", "https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/defining-away-vaccine-safety-signals?s=r"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
