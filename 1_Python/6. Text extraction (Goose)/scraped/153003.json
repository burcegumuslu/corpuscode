The skin disorders cause symptoms like inflammation, dryness, redness, and scaling.\n\nEczema is more common in babies and small children, and only 2-4% of all adults develop eczema at some point in their life. The outer layer of the skin becomes inflamed and damaged, which creates perfect conditions for irritation and sensitivity.\n\nChanges in skin color and texture\n\nEczema is usually treated with creams and ointments, but the problem lies deep in the system. The treatment of eczema should start from the core of the problem. Treating the symptoms won\u2019t do the trick, as they will soon come back, and you\u2019ll have to start all over again.\n\nWe give you some of the most common root causes of eczema:\n\nYour genes carry information, and if you are predisposed to develop eczema, there\u2019s no way to stop it. Mutated genes affect the production of filaggrin, a protein that protects the corneal skin layer.\n\nThe skin dries due to insufficient production of natural oils. Genetic factors or poor immunity affect the production of serum.\n\nLow immune system can\u2019t fight inflammation or ward of yeast and bacteria. Medication, autoimmune disorders, untreated infections, nutrient deficiencies, and weak intestinal function can affect the role of your immune system.\n\nAllergies trigger the release of antibodies and affect the immune response. Some foods, chemical exposure, harsh toxins, perfumes and soaps cause allergies.\n\nSmoking and pollution leave traces of toxins in the body, and overtime these buildups manifest on the skin. Excessive use of antibiotics has a devastating effect on the immune system, and lead to toxicity.\n\nPeople who live in cold countries or developed countries are more prone to eczema, due to dry and cold weather. Pollution and unhealthy dietary habits can also lead to the development of severe skin disorders.\n\nBreastfeeding protects the baby from allergies, unlike formula-fed babies who are more prone to eczema.\n\nScientists are working on specific testing that would determine whether vaccines cause eczema. It may be just a coincidence, but the number of eczema sufferers has multiplied after the use of vaccines increased. This requires further research, and scientists will soon confirm the link between vaccines and eczema.\n\nTips on how to treat eczema\n\nScratching can additionally worsen your problem, so try not to do it. Don\u2019t peel dried skin either, as this may cause open sores and bacterial infections.\n\nCarefully pick your food. The same applies to skin care products and cleaning products, because some of the ingredients may cause allergies.\n\nEat more foods packed with anti-inflammatory foods to strengthen your immune system.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "8 Root Causes Of Eczema Doctors Never Treat", "description": "Eczema includes medical conditions in which the skin is inflamed and irritated.
