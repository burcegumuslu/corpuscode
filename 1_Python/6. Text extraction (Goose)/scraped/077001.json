A Pandemic sweeps the world targeting the elderly and co-morbidity, essentially the weakest among us. This of course is tragic and does demand a response from a Christian point of view: Matt. 25:40 (American Standard Version) says \u201cInasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me.\u201d This is not me saying we should have just rolled over and let nature take her course, but that men are meant to adapt\u2014TO THE REAL PROBLEM\u2014not one that turns into a phony, agenda-driven issue.\n\nSo, here is part one of the \u201cExistential Threat\u201d.\n\nThe pandemic, which for much of the planet, was a matter of stepping up one\u2019s levels to try to get more healthy to simply avoid it. It was like a wake-up call. But what is the response due to the hysteria that was put upon people? Shut down. How is this any different from the old \u201d Turn on, tune in, drop out\u201d era? Interestingly enough, many in that generation now push a control-oriented agenda that is leading to basically what Timothy Leary preached. It\u2019s no wonder drug-related problems are going thru the roof. The destruction of THE INDIVIDUAL to fight through head-on came to pass, and the result is predictable. I will just go along to get along and any desire for exceptionalism is cast to the four winds.\n\nIt is not that everywhere. There are notable exceptions where people went the other way. When Covid came, I focused harder on God and training. I went on a rampage with bodybuilding, competing every 2 months, taking the risk that I would get blown off the stage, but trying to enhance in each competition. If you do not do steroids (its obvious I do not at 5\u20199\u2033, weighing at 154lbs), YOU HAVE TO BE HEALTHY. I double down on my immune system research and even talked to doctors who see the parallels of the Covid response to climate. That makes one question our so-called authority. I marveled at Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2014who had not treated a patient in 30 years\u2014who told doctors on the front lines that they didn\u2019t know what they were doing, which is akin to climate people that have never made a forecast yet believe their ideas are the only ones that matter. Anyhow, off I went and I\u2019m still going. I could get Covid tomorrow. Heck, I might have had it. My parents died from it. My brother and his family got it. We were all in the same house at Christmas. My point is that if we laid flat and simply got pushed around by the whim of every Dr. Fauci statement, would we be better off? It is like the assertion that just because you got the vaccine, it was not as bad when you got it. What a joke in the first place, since it was sold to us as something that would prevent Covid. How the heck can you possibly say if you got Covid and it was not as bad? If you knew that before why didn\u2019t you say it? What about all the people who did not get the vaccine and nothing terrible happened or the people who got the vaccine and still succumbed? I am not going to get into possible side effects, but why are we now seeing so many heart check-up ads on TV? But people accept that and it means they feel powerless on their own to fight back. It destroys the hope of putting one\u2019s faith in God for wisdom and strength. A total refutation of, \u201cOur help is in the name of the Lord.\u201d You have to then put your faith in those who are in control. And there it is, another aspect of the agenda: reliance on others rather than yourself and your heavenly father.\n\nEssentially, when you crush hope with such talk of you can\u2019t do this without us, what do you think happens? It\u2019s the lesson of the ants. Take them from their colony and put them in a container and they will dig like mad, building a network of tunnels for the good of the colony (and in search of their queen). Once they complete the task and there is no hope of finding the queen, they simply lay around and do nothing. Without a vision, not only do people perish, but it is a likely thread down to the smallest creatures in nature. Man was not built to lie around, but to reach beyond his grasp. What you see going on now is anti-human as it DESTROYS that motivation. So, when you slam the youth with talk of doom and gloom, what do you think is going to happen? It is so bad that in the most recent LDS church General Conference, there were talks on countering the depression that has led to the desperation we are seeing in our youth today. The culprit is total confusion (including blurring lines biologically, which is what the Babylonians did to Daniel, changing his name to \u201cLady who serves the king\u201d in Babylonian) to break the spirit of the individual with an upwardly mobile desire. It\u2019s easier to control a weak sleeping man than one that is strong and smart.\n\nNow to climate. I wrote about it in my book, the Weaponization of Weather in the Phony Climate War. People are absolutely terrified that the climate is out of control and so they accept left and right what they are told, They don\u2019t dig in below the surface. They are not taught to embrace adversity (even if it\u2019s not there in this case) adapt and counter. So why work if the planet is a living hell hole? This is an astounding belief since life on planet earth is better than it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s amazing how shallow the thinking is with people that wish to throw up their arms and give up. Do they not realize that the very agenda they buy into is the agenda that is enslaving them with what is mass poverty of individual thought and freedom? You can\u2019t make this up. The brilliance of the parasitic climate predators has led to this. They know their mark and how to take from the hard-working host and then prey on the weaker. They know people have to be mentally and physically demoralized so their will breaks. They use a phony war for their real war, which is to break the will of the people. You saw Hitler and now Putin do it by bombing civilians. How is this not the same thing, dressed up in a phony save the world missive? Putin is trying his own version of Pax Romana, so did Hitler\u2014if I rule what I want then everything is peaceful (Rome\u2019s theory). Well, I again ask, how is the climate agenda, or any of these ball of confusion agendas any different? Basically, do everything our way and it will all be fine. Those ants are very peaceful lying around with no challenges.\n\nMaybe the reason for diversity and varying cultures IS TO ADVANCE THE HUMAN CONDITION. The whole control agenda runs counter to that\u2014I do not know. But I do know that Covid, Climate and a whole bunch of other things share a common link of distraction and fear, and they are designed not to advance the individual, but destroy his will. And that is an anti-human agenda to me.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Carpet bombing hope", "description": "\"...In the face of existential threats such as the pandemic and climate change, the Great Resignation and lie flat have the potential to spark a deeper discussion about the relentless pursuit of wealth, at the individual level and for nations as a whole...\" \u2014 Bloomberg\r\n\r\nThis is simply astounding.
