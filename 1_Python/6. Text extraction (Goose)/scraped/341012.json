They completely disregard the federal common rule.\n\nThese mandates of an experimental vaccine are explicitly illegal. They are explicitly inconsistent with the code. They are explicitly inconsistent with the Bellmont Report.\n\nThey are flat-out illegal and they don\u2019t care. They are lawless.\n\nThey completely disregard bio-ethics. They\u2019ve broken all the rules that I know, that I\u2019ve been trained on for years.\n\nHopefully, we are going to stop them before they take our kids.\n\nAs it relates to the \u201cout of control lawless government\u201d Dr. Malone openly spoke about in his chilling interview with Joe Rogan, this transcript sees Security Council Members noting the numerous prior warnings issued to the American people\u2014like President Woodrow Wilson warning them: \u201cSince I entered politics, I have chiefly had men\u2019s views confided to me privately\u2026Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something\u2026They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it\u201d\u2014like President Theodore Roosevelt warning them: \u201cBehind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people\u201d\u2014and like United States Senator Daniel K. Inouye warning them: \u201cThere exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself\u201d.\n\nThe critical importance underlying Security Council Members reviewing these \u201cinvisible government\u201d warnings issued to the American people is because it directly relates to President Trump, who upon taking power in January-2017, began a war to the death against these hidden powers, and enlisted President Putin as his main ally to defeat and destroy them\u2014and saw this alliance forged in January-2018, which was when Russia\u2019s top three intelligence directors\u2014Foreign Intelligence Service Director Sergey Naryshkin (SVR) , Federal Security Service Director Aleksandr Bortnikov (FSB) and Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate Colonel-General Igor Korobov (GRU) made an historic and unprecedented visit to Washington D.C. to meet with their CIA, FBI and US Military intelligence director counterparts.\n\nIn the nearly four years since this mysterious alliance was formed between President Trump and President Putin to destroy this \u201cinvisible government\u201d secretly controlling America, one of the main clues about it points to there being a pact forged between the CIA and SVR to lead this war to the death, and directly relates to the current CIA Director William Burns\u2014most important to know about is that CIA Director Burns retired from the US Foreign Service in 2014 after a 33-year diplomatic career, from 2001 to 2005, served under President George W. Bush as Ambassador of the United States to the Russian Federation, and from 2014 to 2021, served as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\u2014and whose confirmation to be CIA Director was by a secret and unanimous voice vote in the US Senate, that didn\u2019t hold any hearings on his nomination.\n\nThis transcript next sees Security Council Members referencing their 26 October 2021 meeting, wherein they noted Biden ordering the CIA to steal the 2022 midterm elections for socialist Democrats\u2014a notation made in the Kremlin official record that was followed eight days later, on 3 November 2021, by CIA Director Burns making a rare visit to the Kremlin to meet with his counterpart SVR Director Naryshkin\u2014a meeting noted about in the highly-classified 3 November 2021 transcript documenting Security Council discussions, whose wording \u201cstrongly suggested that CIA Director Burns informed the Kremlin that Biden is not in charge of the United States\u201d\u2014and is critical to notice because in today\u2019s highly-classified transcript, it sees Security Council Members noting that since Biden seized power nearly a year ago, the United States Senate has only confirmed to office 266 of the 1,250 government officials needed to run the government, and has only confirmed to office 31 of 93 open US Attorney positions\u2014which are staggering numbers leading one to logically question if Biden isn\u2019t in control of the American government, then who is?\n\nIn further piecing together the parts of this highly-classified transcript permitted to openly commented on, most stunning to notice are Security Council Members discussing a mysterious event that occurred in 2016 while the US Presidential Election was raging, that we documented in our 19 March 2016 report \u201cTop CIA Official Killed In Russia Aboard Dubai Plane Carrying Millions Of US Dollars\u201d and our 21 March 2016 report \u201cFlyDubai Crash In Russia Now Labeled \u201cCriminal Act\u201d After US Missile Fragments Found\u201d.\n\nThough we can\u2019t be exactly certain why Security Council Members were discussing this mysterious 2016 event in today\u2019s transcript, it bears noticing that they directly link it to the following:\n\n\u201cI don't know much about foreign affairs\u201d: President George W. Bush made startling confession to \u2019s ambassador, National Archive documents reveal.\n\nThe U.S. military spent $14 trillion during two decades of war and relied heavily on companies to perform critical functions. One-third to half of that sum went to contractors, with five defense companies\u2014 Lockheed Martin Corp. , Boeing Co. , General Dynamics Corp. , Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. \u2014taking the lion\u2019s share, $2.1 trillion, for weapons, supplies and other services.\n\nUS Army General Joseph Votel, head of the special operations command (SOCOM) characterized the Obama era as a \u201cgolden age for special operations\u201d. General Votel's Green Berets were deployed to 133 countries\u201470 percent of the world\u2014in 2014 alone.\n\nAlong with Security Council Members referencing the warmongering actions of now retired United States Army General Joseph Votel, this transcript sees them noting that some of his top co-conspirators who wantonly stole $14-trillion from the American people to wage their endless failed wars that have killed hundreds-of-thousands are now retired United States Army Major General Paul Eaton, now retired United States Army Major General Antonio Taguba and now retired United States Army Brigadier General Steven Anderson\u2014all three of whom just released the open letter \u201cThe Military Must Prepare Now For A 2024 Insurrection\u201d, wherein they order socialist leader Biden to begin an immediate purge of the United States Military to throw out all supporters of President Trump, conservatives of all types and Christians, with them warning:\n\nAs we approach the first anniversary of the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, we \u2014 all of us former senior military officials \u2014 are increasingly concerned about the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election and the potential for lethal chaos inside our military, which would put all Americans at severe risk.\n\nIn short: We are chilled to our bones at the thought of a coup succeeding next time.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members noting that above anyone else, United States Army generals are expected, by education, training and experience, to accurately assess threats and give honest conclusions about them\u2014but in this case of General\u2019s Eaton, Taguba and Anderson using as their main basis for issuing this warning the \u201cdeadly insurrection\u201d at the US Capitol, the factual reality shows no such thing occurred, and as confirmed yesterday when it was revealed: \u201cFederal prosecutors have charged more than 725 individuals with various crimes for the 6 January protests at the US Capitol...Of those arrested, 225 people were charged with assault or resisting arrest. More than 75 of those were charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon against police officers...Some 640 people were charged with entering a restricted federal building or its grounds...And another 75 were charged with entering a restricted area with a deadly weapon\u201d\u2014and is a critical revelation to note, specifically because not one American has been charged with \u201cinsurrection\u201d.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript next note a recent Quinnipiac poll that found 93% of Democrats and 56% of independents considered the 6 January protests an attack on the government, while only 29% of Republicans said the same\u2014a poll proving that the events of 6 January are being viewed by Americans through the lens of the media narrative they\u2019re paying attention to, not the facts\u2014and whose fast eroding support among Americans for the socialist narrative is now being accelerated by the Christmas Day bombshell legal filing involving the so-called Governor Gretchen Whitmer plot, wherein it documents how the FBI actually concocted the entire crime, and whose top FBI agent that schemed up the plot was arrested for beating his wife when she objected to him offering her body to swingers.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members further noting that the collapse of the socialist narrative about the 6 January protests among Americans is being fueled by them noticing Biden\u2019s federal prosecutors dismissed almost half the cases against Antifa rioters\u2014socialist rioters whose over $1-billion damage caused is the most expensive in American insurance history, that stands opposed to the paltry $1.5-million damage caused to the US Capitol by 6 January protesters, none of whose charges have been dismissed\u2014while 54-year old Robert Scott Palmer was thrown in prison for 5-years for taking part in the 6 January protest and throwing a wooden plank at police officers, at the same time it saw Biden\u2019s federal prosecutors dropping all charges against 26-year-old transgender woman Eva Warner, an Antifa rioter who visciously attacked police and tried to blind them with a laser\u2014to heap even more humiliation on ordinary Americans it saw Biden\u2019s socialist forces refusing to jail top FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith after he was convicted for forging the CIA document that kicked off the Russiagate hoax, and this week saw his law license restored\u2014then last evening, Biden\u2019s federal prosecutors dropped all the charges aginst the jail guards who stood by when child sex slaver Jeffery Epstein was murdered in his prison cell.\n\nIn noticing how these socialist insanities are tearing America apart at the seams, this transcript sees Security Council Members noting with interest the just published article \u201cGood Old Guns Suddenly Replace Liberal Values In This Blue State\u201d, wherein it reveals: \u201cAfter months of embracing criminal reform, which had a knack for keeping criminals on the streets, California\u2019s elite are taking measures \u2013 like panic-buying guns \u2013 that show they\u2019re not so different from conservatives after all\u201d\u2014a revelation that joins the article \u201cThe Great Pandemic Migration\u201d, wherein it reveals millions of Americans are now fleeing Democrat socialist controlled Blue States for the Red Free States run by Republicans\u2014is all occurring at the same time a new University of Massachusetts Amherst poll shows only 6% of Republicans believe Biden\u2019s election was \u201cdefinitely legitimate\u201d and leftist MSNBC political analyst Mehdi Hasan is now warning: \u201cTwenty-one million Americans are open to using force to restore the presidency to Donald Trump\u201d\u2014a warning quickly responded to by Republican Party lawmaker US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who just ignited the #1 trend National Divorce after she wrote: \u201cYou know what is necessary about threatening a divorce?...It\u2019s a wake up call to the one offending the other that they\u2019ve had enough...And if the other party cares at all, they look at what they are doing wrong and care to fix it...National Divorce is not civil war...But the state of our union is currently far from happy, and I really don\u2019t care how many Democrats I offend by calling it out\u201d\u2014and in quick reply to the National Divorce call made by Congresswoman Greene, the leftist Washington Post rushed out their article \u201cSecession Might Seem Like The Lesser Of Two evils. It\u2019s Also The Less Likely\u201d, wherein it states: \u201cWhen Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) talks about a \u201cNational Divorce,\u201d as she did again in a tweet on Wednesday, she may be advancing the cause of secession or she may just be seeking attention...Either way, she knows what she\u2019s doing \u2014 reinforcing the idea of disunion that has taken hold in the outer reaches of the public imagination...At least it\u2019s not civil war \u2014 and other countries do it all the time \u2014 but breaking up the union would be next to impossible here\u201d.\n\nThe conclusion section of this transcript sees Security Council Members agreeing that a \u201cnational divorce\u201d of the United States to prevent a civil war by splitting it into pieces would be as catastrophic for global stability as the dissolution of the former Soviet Union was\u2014and in piecing together what little parts of this highly-classified conclusion section that\u2019s permitted to be revealed, it sees Security Council Members appearing to rely on the mysterious CIA-Russia pact worked out by President Trump and President Putin to avert such a catastrophe from happening\u2014which makes it critical to notice this conclusion section referencing such things like a new poll revealing that United States Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has the highest approval of any American leader, his Russian counterpart Chairman Valery Zorkin of the Constitutional Court this week calling for the restoration of the death penalty, and the United States Department of Defense revealing that it\u2019s constructing a new courtroom for war crimes trials at Guant\u00e1namo Bay-Cuba\u2014and in putting all of these \u201cpieces\u201d together, one can glimpse the framework of Yugoslavia-type solution being worked out for America, where the warring parties will be forced into peace and the war criminals will be tried and hung for their crimes against humanity and the American people.
