And rest assured that if you get side effects, they will be a lot easier to tolerate than getting the flu.\n\nPain, redness, itching and a little soreness in your shoulder is common, Dr. Benjamin says, and could last up to five days after the shot. \"That's not an allergic reaction,\" he clarifies. \"It's the first evidence that the body has absorbed the medication and is using it to train your body to fight off infection.\"\n\nBut here's the catch: Don't do it right away. \"You don't want to shut down the blood vessels too soon,\" says Dr. Savoy, who completed a postdoctoral fellowship in vaccine science with the American Academy of Family Physicians. \"If you put ice on too soon, it will take longer (for your body) to absorb the vaccine.\"\n\nFor itching at the injection site, Dr. Savoy says, you could take an antihistamine such as loratadine, the active ingredient in products like Claritin and Alavert. Many companies, such as CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Costco, also sell the generic equivalent of these over-the-counter products.\n\n\"The flu shot cannot give you the flu,\" Dr. Benjamin says. \"It is just like any of our other vaccines designed to stimulate your immune system so that you can more easily fight off the virus if infected.\"\n\nDr. Savoy explains it this way: \"There are people who get an immune response, fever, muscle aches, fatigue. The difference is that once your body realizes you're not getting the flu, those stop. When a person has actual influenza, it can last for a week or more.\"\n\n\"You don't have a fever until you get to 100.5,\" Dr. Benjamin says. \"You shouldn't worry about it until it gets to 103. If it doesn't come down with Tylenol after one or two days, you should call your doctor.\"", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Doctors explain the best ways to manage flu vaccine side effects, including symptoms like itching or a rash at the injection site, arm tingling, fever and aches.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/283396-signs-to-look-for-after-a-flu-shot/", "title": "The Best Ways to Deal With Flu Vaccine Side Effects, According to Doctors | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2Facdf3cf77eea41a7ae150b1b6f527317.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728485-how-to-get-flu-vaccine/", "https://apha.org/about-apha/executive-board-and-staff/apha-staff/georges-c-benjamin-md", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728165-flu-shot-vaccine-myths/", "/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "/article/266510-how-to-lift-weights-after-a-flu-shot/", "/article/13721578-flu-shot-benefits/", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/general.htm#side-effects", "/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "/article/266510-how-to-lift-weights-after-a-flu-shot/", "/article/13721578-flu-shot-benefits/", "https://www.aafp.org/about/meet-our-leadership/aafp-emt/savoy.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731885-exercises-reduce-arm-soreness-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://share.upmc.com/2016/12/arm-pain-after-vaccinations/", "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21223-antihistamines", "https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/getting-a-flu-shot-skip-the-advil-tylenol-for-mild", "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645515.2017.1423153", "https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/guillainbarre.htm", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985921/#j_jtim-2019-0028_ref_056", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13721578-flu-shot-benefits/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13721578-flu-shot-benefits/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13723327-your-weight-and-the-flu/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13723327-your-weight-and-the-flu/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13768052-flu-statistics/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13768052-flu-statistics/"], "authors": ["//storage.leafmedia.io/contentlab-data/profile/8/9/776a729244524a26af334650acda701e.jpeg", "Ronni Gordon"], "publish_date": null}
