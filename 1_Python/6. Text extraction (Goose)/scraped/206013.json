Aside from this, Sigoloff has also questioned the safety of the vaccine\u2019s ingredients. These unsafe injections are being pushed aggressively on military personnel.\n\nThe military doctor \u2013 who moved to Fort Huachuca in Arizona to serve as its medical director \u2013 said that while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate was legally written, it was applied in an illegal manner. (Related: Mike Adams and Dr. Gaston Cornu-Labat talk about health freedom and asserting individual rights against medical tyranny.)\n\nSigoloff also told Adams that following his own research into the COVID-19 vaccines, he found that Comirnaty \u2013 the only vaccine allowed by the military \u2013 is dangerous. The military doctor explained that the vaccine\u2019s material safety data sheet states it is not validated for human use and that many of its toxicology reports are classified. Lipid nanoparticles in the mRNA vaccines are not validated for use in both humans and animals, he added.\n\n\u201cI want to make it very clear that Comirnaty has never been produced, and there are many reasons for that,\u201d said Sigoloff. \u201cI\u2019ve got a podcast where I talked about how a representative from Pfizer says that it was made in France. If you\u2019ve been told that you took Comirnaty, they lied to you.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Health Ranger, data about Comirnaty is classified because people are not allowed to know what is in the vaccines \u2013 yet they have to take it. He added that this is the message the Department of Defense (DOD) wants to send to military personnel.\n\nIn response to Adams\u2019 questions about post-vaccination adverse effects, Sigoloff shared \u201chorrible things\u201d that happened to his patients. In one instance, the breastfed child of a female military member experienced a daily fever for 10 months. The child began suffering from the adverse effect after the mother got vaccinated.\n\nPentagon trying to kill off American soldiers en masse\n\nAccording to the Brighteon.com founder, the evidence is clear that the COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 partly a product of gain-of-function research done in Wuhan \u2013 are biological weapons.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like to me,\u201d he told Sigoloff. \u201cAnd to most Americans who are aware of this information, it begs the question: Why would the leadership of the military be trying to murder military personnel? Why isn\u2019t the leadership doing everything possible to protect the soldiers rather than subjecting them to these risks from a bioweapon?\u201d\n\nSigoloff agreed, remarking that the DOD is forcing military personnel to get injected with a bioweapon partly or totally developed by China. Adams then recalled a 2000 speech delivered by former People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) Gen. Chi Haotian that called for China to use biological weapons against Americans.\n\n\u201cThere has been rapid development of modern biological technology, and new bioweapons have been invented one after another. Of course, we have not been idle,\u201d Chi said at the time.\n\n\u201cIn the past years, we have seized the opportunity to master weapons of this kind. We are capable of achieving our purpose of \u2018cleaning up\u2019 America all of a sudden. If our biological weapons succeed in the surprise attack, the Chinese people will be able to keep their losses at a minimum in the fight against the United States.\u201d\n\nAdams continued that this was not a wild conspiracy theory, but an actual posture well-known among PLA generals.\n\nMoreover, Sigoloff mentioned that he was suspended by the DOD for giving out exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine. He did not regret his actions, however, explaining that everything he did was well within his right and duty as a doctor and military physician to take care of the patient.\n\nFollow HealthFreedom.news for more news about efforts to push back against the military COVID-19 vaccine mandate.\n\nWatch the video below to featuring the conversation between Mike Adams and Dr. Sam Sigoloff.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMilitary doctor says she was ordered to cover up wave of covid \u201cvaccine\u201d injuries in servicemen.\n\nCover up: DOD silent after whistleblowers expose COVID \u2018vaccine\u2019 injuries in military.\n\nMedical board moves to revoke certification of Dr. Peter McCullough who dared question COVID vaccine narratives.\n\nDave Racer says it\u2019s time for Americans to push back against Biden\u2019s tyrannical COVID-19 mandates \u2013 Brighteon.TV.", "opengraph": {"title": "Dr. Sam Sigoloff tells Mike Adams: Pentagon\u2019s vaccine mandate was legally written but applied in an ILLEGAL manner", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-11-10-pentagon-vaccine-mandate-legally-written-illegally-applied.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "Military physician Dr. Sam Sigoloff discussed his fight for health freedom in the military with Health Ranger Mike Adams.
