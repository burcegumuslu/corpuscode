The majority of these case reports involved people aged between 31 and 50 in the United States.\n\nMore than 25,000 nervous system disorders were reported, along with 17,000 musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and 14,000 gastrointestinal disorders. A range of different autoimmune conditions were reported, along with some peculiar maladies, including 270 \u201cspontaneous abortions,\u201d and incidences of herpes, epilepsy, heart failure and strokes, among thousands of others.\n\nThese side effects were previously known, and have all been logged on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, which as of Sunday has tracked 3,300 deaths following vaccination with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, a figure broadly in keeping with the company\u2019s own data.\n\nCritics say that some of these deaths cannot be conclusively linked to vaccination, while others argue that the true number of deaths and adverse effects is underreported.\n\nCritically, Pfizer\u2019s documents were used by the FDA to declare the company\u2019s jab safe, which it did for Americans aged 16 and older in August. It has since been approved for children as young as five, and booster doses for people aged 16 and up were approved last week.\n\nThe FDA says it may take until 2096 to release all 451,000 pages it used to approve Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nIn the face of the more transmissible and apparently more vaccine-resistant Omicron strain of the coronavirus, the US government has continued to tout vaccination as key to defeating Covid-19. So too has Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who said on Wednesday that a fourth shot of his company\u2019s vaccine may be needed to keep immunity levels up.\n\nWith one South African study showing Pfizer\u2019s vaccine up to 40 times less effective against Omicron than previous variants, the company says it could have an Omicron-specific vaccine on the market by March 2022.\n\nYou can actually participate in the global efforts to cripple the Deep State organized criminal cabal's ability for genocide, while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same time, by boycotting Big Pharma for good.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Pfizer Recorded Nearly 160,000 Adverse Reactions to Its Covid-19 Vaccine", "url": "https://geopolitics.co/2021/12/13/pfizer-recorded-nearly-160000-adverse-reactions-to-its-covid-19-vaccine/", "description": "Documents released by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reveal that drugmaker Pfizer recorded nearly 160,000 adverse reactions to its Covid-19 vaccine in the initial months of its rollout.", "article:published_time": "2021-12-13T14:07:48+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-27T18:44:21+00:00", "site_name": "Covert Geopolitics", "image": "https://geopolitics.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/61b661c585f54071355978bd.jpg", "image:width": "980", "image:height": "551", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["pfizer vaccines", "pfizer clinical trial"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf", "https://geopolitics.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf", "https://geopolitics.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CUMULATIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-POST-AUTHORIZATION-ADVERSE-EVENT-REPORTS-OF-PF-0730204.pdf", "https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=AB8BD32B38BC34CA7AA15754985C", "https://secureservercdn.net/50.62.198.70/1mx.c5c.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MEDRXIV-2021-267417v2-Sigal.pdf", "https://virutron.com/", "https://virutron.com/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-12-13T14:07:48+00:00"}
