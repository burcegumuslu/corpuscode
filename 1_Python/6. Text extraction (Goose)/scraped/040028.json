On the global scale, given the 3.7 million fatalities in India alone, having vDFR = 1 % (Rancourt, 2022), and given the age-stratified vDFR results presented in this work, it is not unreasonable to assume an all-population global value of vDFR = 0.1 %. Based on the global number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered to date (13.25 billion 24 doses, up to 24 January 2023, Our World in Data),3 this would correspond to 13 million deaths from the COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. By comparison, the official World Health Organization (WHO) number of COVID-19 deaths to date is 6.8 million (6,817,478 deaths, reported to WHO, as 3 February 2023),4 which are not detected as COVID-19 assignable deaths in ACM studies.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - New Paper: An Estimated 13 Million People Worldwide Killed by the COVID Vaccines", "description": "New Paper: An Estimated 13 Million People Worldwide Killed by the COVID Vaccines By Steve Kirsch That\u2019s twice as many as were killed by the virus.
