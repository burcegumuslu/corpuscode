Price Foundation dispels 7 popular myths used by big pharma to promote vaccination\n\n\n\nWant to protect your child from:\n\nThe foundation, known for its \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d nutrition advice, has produced volumes of research and articles related to vaccine damage and ineffectiveness, but this article sums it up the best with a list of \u201cmyths\u201d and \u201ctruths\u201d and a long list of studies to back up each claim: MYTH #1 : Vaccines prevent disease\n\n TRUTH: Many diseases such as polio and whooping cough (pertussis) are CAUSED by vaccines. The number of infants receiving three or more doses of the pertussis vaccine rose from 61 percent to 96 percent between 1991 and 2012. The outbreak of the pertussis virus increased 10-fold over the same period.\n\nWhenever we have a normal infection like chicken pox, two arms of our immune system get activated. First is the antibody-based response in the B cells, which make antibodies to remember what happened. [This is the part vaccines activate]. Second is a cell-mediated activation, where the white blood cells chew up the invader and spit it out through fever, mucus, rash, achiness and sweating\u2014all those things we call being sick. [This is the part vaccines bypass and deactivate]. A vaccine is a specific attempt to activate a antibody response and deactivate the cell-mediated response \u2026 If you get sick with fever, rash, mucus, after you had a vaccine, that would be a bad vaccine. No one would want that vaccine. The whole point of a vaccine is to deactivate the cell-mediated response so you don\u2019t feel sick, but to activate the antibody response. This is exactly the same immune situation you see with cancer and auto-immune disease. The cell-mediated response is the only way your body expels microorganisms and foreign proteins, and that response gets shut down with vaccinations. Everyone who is vaccinated ends up with an over-stimulated antibody system and an under-stimulated cell-mediated system. Add to that the use of fever-suppressing drugs like aspirin and Tylenol, as well as antibiotics that kill the bacteria in our guts, and we have a recipe for cancer. The incidence of cancer has skyrocketed with the introduction of vaccines and with the suppression of the acute sick response. Unlike the primitive man who accepts everything in nature and in the body as a natural process, the civilized man tries to suppress natural processes; he is afraid of them, or thinks they serve no purpose, and cancer is the result. MYTH #2: High vaccine rates create herd immunity\n\n TRUTH: Herd immunity is a result of permanent immunity, which is only achieved by natural infection\n\nAccording to another WAP article, when a baby becomes infected with a foreign pathogen, his immune system responds through \u201ca sophisticated web of interlocking reactions\u201d that can produce lifelong immunity to naturally acquired childhood illnesses. These layers of defense systems exist \u201cto keep invading microbes and viruses from taking hold in the deeper systems and organs of the body.\u201d \u201cBut vaccines \u2026 are injected directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the natural immune response. This deprives the body of the ability to naturally develop life-long immunity to normal childhood illnesses like measles, mumps and chicken pox. Mass vaccination is a man-made attempt to remove the natural infection response from human development and replace it with a series of artificially imposed infections and immune responses determined by the doctor\u2019s vaccination schedule.\u201d MYTH #3: Only by vaccinating every child can we protect all children from disease TRUTH: Vaccinated children spread viruses for months after vaccination, prolonging the life of the virus According to VAERS, the government\u2019s own Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, there have been nearly half a million adverse reactions reported since 1990. The former head of the FDA has admitted only about 1 percent of of serious adverse events are reported, so there have probably been closer to 50 MILLION serious adverse reactions to vaccines in the last 25 years!! Reported reactions include: * Over 4000 deaths\n\n * Almost 8000 life-threatening reactions\n\n * Almost 8000 permanent disabilities\n\n * Over 170,000 ER visits immediately after vaccination\n\n * Almost 30,000 hospitalizations MYTH #5: Vaccines don\u2019t cause AUTISM.\n\n TRUTH: There are over 100 peer reviewed studies, linking vaccines to Autism. A meta-analysis of ALL studies on the topic showed a positive correlation between mercury and autism by a ratio of 3 to 1. So, for every study that shows no correlation, there are three that do. Vaccines are also linked to ADHD, which occurs in less than 2 percent of unvaccinated children and 8 percent of vaccinated children. Additionally, asthma is found in only .2 percent of unvaccinated children compared to 15 percent of vaccinated children. MYTH #6: The amount of aluminum and mercury in vaccines is insignificant\n\n TRUTH: The amount of aluminum and mercury in vaccines is considered extremely toxic when ingested, and injection of these materials makes them harder to eliminate ALUMINUM: A fully vaccinated 18-month old baby has received 5000 mcg of aluminum. The allowable maximum per day for intravenous feeding for healthy baby is 18 mcg. There are also 500 mcg of aluminum in each dose of the new Gardasil vaccine. The amount of aluminum needed by our bodies? Zero. The number of studies proving safety of injecting aluminum into infants? Zero. MERCURY: The amount of mercury in liquid waste considered toxic by the EPA? 200 parts per billion. The amount of mercury in \u201cthimerisol-free\u201d vaccines? 2000 ppb. Some infant flu shots contain 25,000 ppb and the multi-dose flu shots given to pregnant women contain 50,000 ppb. All that\u2019s necessary to kill neuroblastoma cells? .5 ppm MYTH #7: The pharmaceutical industry creates vaccines for the common good TRUTH: Vaccines are a huge money maker for the pharmaceutical industry Revenue from vaccines in 2013 alone was $24 BILLION and is projected to be $100 BILLION by 2025. This only accounts for direct revenue from vaccines. The amount generated for the medical and pharmaceutical industries to \u201cfix\u201d damages they caused remains untold. \u201cLet your food be your medicine\u201d \u201cChildhood diseases are either mild or non-existent when parents practice the kind of good nutrition that we advocate. Diets rich in vitamins A and C can protect children against disease much better than vaccinations, and with side effects that are good, never harmful. Public health policy should be aimed at accurate information about nutrition, not the promotion of vaccinations that actually suppress the immune system and often have tragic side effects,\u201d WAP president Sally Fallon writes. If you must vaccinate, WAP recommends the following guidelines:\n\u2022 Wait until the child is at least two years old.\n\u2022 Do not give more than one vaccination at a time.\n\u2022 Never vaccinate when the child is sick.\n\u2022 Be sure vaccines are thimerosal-free.\n\u2022 Supplement with extra cod liver oil, vitamin C and B12 before and after each shot.\n\u2022 Put your child to bed for at least 24 hours after a shot.\n\u2022 Obtain a medical exemption if the child has had a bad reaction to a vaccination before or if there is a personal or family history of vaccine reactions.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "7 Reasons Vaccinating Your Child Could Be the Worst Mistake You Ever Make", "description": "The Weston A.
