It began with a poorly negotiated agreement \u2013 poor, that is, from the European Union perspective \u2013 between Brussels and AstraZeneca for the supply of COVID-19 vaccine doses. Less rigorous in terms of penalties and consequences than the UK-AstraZeneca deal, the EU version was very much the poor cousin, giving the company much latitude in terms of production schedules and delays. While the UK government managed to insert the relevant clause allowing it to terminate the deal and invoke punitive clauses against AstraZeneca, the EU contract makes no mention of it. But in August 2020, little heed to this was paid by EU negotiators, starry-eyed to the company\u2019s promise to supply 300 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine, with the option of securing a further 100 million. The result was a defanged deal based on gentlemanly promises\n\nDelays and supply problems duly manifested. In January, the drugs company informed the European Commission that it would ship fewer doses to the bloc than was originally promised. \u201cWhile there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe,\u201d stated an AstraZeneca spokesperson, \u201cinitial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain.\u201d Within the first three months, 30 million jabs of the initial 90 million made its way to the EU. Little by way of improvement was shown in the next quarter: 70 million doses from 180 million promised.\n\nThe delays and supply disruptions have resulted in a sluggish immunisation effort in the EU and also done its bit to fray relations between the bloc and the UK. EU officials have looked on, envious and irritated at the UK\u2019s own, comparatively more successful and rapid immunisation campaign.\n\nIt is precisely that latitude of behaviour on the part of the company that is now being challenged in the courts. The European Commission is suing AstraZeneca, arguing that the company has not discharged its obligations under the vaccine supply contract nor possess an appropriate plan for the timely delivery of doses. \u201cOur priority,\u201d wrote Stella Kyriakides, the EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, \u201cis to ensure COVID-19 vaccine deliveries take place to protect the health of [EU citizens].\u201d\n\nIn court, the EU\u2019s Rafa\u00ebl Jafferali submitted that, \u201cWe demand deliveries by the end of June and we also demand with immediate effect the use of all plants listed in the contract.\u201d A central contention is that AstraZeneca had preferred not utilising all those mentioned (four are noted, two of which are located in the UK); the EU argument is that the company was under an obligation to use all the plants. Not doing so put it in breach of the contract.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s Hakim Boularbah\u2019s submission showed how far apart the parties are in terms of understanding the contract. \u201cThere is no obligation to use the factories,\u201d came the argument. The point is crucial, given that the company has only utilised sites in Belgium and the Netherlands, sparing the UK outfits run by Oxford Biomedica and Cobra Biologics. There has also been no resort to the Catalent factory in the United States, mentioned in the contract as a possible \u201cback-up supply site\u201d.\n\nWhatever the merits of the EU\u2019s legal arguments, certain countries within the bloc have been circumspect about dragging the company through the courts. Germany and France have expressed misgivings. As one diplomat explained to , \u201cWhat can we do in practical terms if AstraZeneca says, \u2018Take a closer look at our production sites: We just have no vaccines\u2019?\u201d There were also questions about the enforceability of any ruling. The entire process risks becoming a vacuous display of anger without effect.\n\nThen comes the issue of bad publicity. Reluctance to take COVID-19 vaccines is a prevalent sentiment within the bloc. Reliability and trust is already being tested. A number of EU diplomats worry that the lawsuit may have the effect of further tarnishing a company that is already struggling in terms of its brand.\n\nMuch of this can be put down to the sabotaging efforts of various leaders within the Union itself, not least of all French President Emmanuel Macron, who has found it hard to resist sniping at the AstraZeneca vaccine. At the end of January, he opined that the vaccine was \u201cquasi-effective\u201d for those over 65 years old. The following month, he changed his mind. The result: French confidence in the vaccine, along with a good deal of Europe\u2019s, has been shattered.\n\nThis distinctly sour note continues the profoundly disunited state of affairs in efforts to battle the global pandemic. Vaccine patriotism and parochialism continue to limit access. Pharmaceutical giants continue to maintain IP protections even as they struggle to maintain supply. And the EU\u2019s own measure of competence in negotiations and planning has been found wanting.\n\nDr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.
