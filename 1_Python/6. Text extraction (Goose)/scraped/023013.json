While public confidence in vaccine safety is decreasing, public debate is being essentially forbidden. Now, police-state measures threatening fines and quarantine of those refusing vaccines are rising, with persecution of the unvaccinated already happening in some places.\n\nIn Rockland County, N.Y., where 186 cases of measles in its population of about 329,000 have been logged since Oct. 2018, the health commissioner announced anyone who \u201cis unvaccinated, has a laboratory-confirmed case of measles, has been identified by a health investigation as being exposed to measles, and is under age 18 will be issued an order to essentially stay at home for up to 21 days.\u201d Parents or guardians who fail to comply with this order are threatened with a $2,000 fine per day.\n\nIn New York City, where an outbreak among ultra-Orthodox Jews that started in the fall when a child returned from Israel contagious with measles, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d and issued an executive order mandating vaccination in the neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens affected by the outbreak. Anyone who has not been vaccinated against measles or cannot show evidence of immunity could face a $1,000 fine.\n\n\u201cUnvaccinated people are being blamed all over the place and people [in reaction] are actually starting to get the vaccine even if they\u2019re older\u201d out of fear, Joe Martino, host of the YouTube-based news show \u201cCollective Evolution,\u201d recently observed. He points to a USA Today video production titled, \u201cHow the anti-vax movement brought the measles back from near extinction.\u201d The video description states: \u201cOutbreaks across the U.S. have forced officials to declare emergencies. Why are we starting to see the rise of these outbreaks? It dates back to the antivax movement.\u201d\n\nThe video states, \u201c[I]n some places, parents can be fined $500 or spend 6 months in jail for not vaccinating their kids. In one New York county, unvaccinated kids are banned from appearing in any public place. . . . The World Health Organization reported that people who chose not to vaccinate are a global health threat.\u201d\n\nUSA Today blames the decreasing compliance with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination requirements on research by Dr. Andrew Wakefield published in The Lancet in 1998, which it calls \u201cone of the most serious frauds in medical history.\u201d\n\nMartino and fellow journalist Arjun Walia, however, note that mass media and pro-vaccine institutions have long misrepresented that Wakefield, a gastroenterologist, firmly linked the MMR vaccine to autism in his published, peer-reviewed findings. In fact, they explain, Wakefield simply proposed a connection between gastro-intestinal issues and autism and noted the possibility of an MMR vaccination linkage. Wakefield clearly stated that more research is needed, yet he lost his medical license, and his reputation was, and continues to be, irreparably smeared worldwide.\n\nWhile USA Today doesn\u2019t note any of the many other developments suggesting the measles vaccine either isn\u2019t effective or actually causes the very illness it\u2019s supposed to prevent, parents choosing not to vaccinate can point to many studies. For instance:\n\u2022 An American Journal of Public Health 1991 study cited an early-1988 outbreak of 84 measles cases at a Colorado college where over 98% of students had documentation of \u201cadequate\u201d measles vaccinations\u2014which is above the \u201cherd immunity\u201d threshold.\n\u2022 In a 2011 outbreak, during which unvaccinated people were demonized, a study from New York City\u2019s Bureau of Immunization of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene \u201cactually traced the measles outbreak to a vaccinated individual who had been twice vaccinated, and they concluded that the measles may occur in vaccinated individuals and secondary transmissions from such vaccine individuals is documented,\u201d as Walia explained, noting these were just two of dozens of studies that exist.\n\u2022 In support of recent legislation (H.B. 1638) in Washington state, biochemical engineer Brian S. Hooker, who has published multiple papers on the issue of ineffective vaccines, addressing a House committee, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with measles in Washington . . . but it\u2019s not low vaccination rates. It\u2019s actually high rates with a vaccination product unable to provide lifetime immunity or vigorous maternal protection to infants during their first year of life.\u201d\n\nAlternative health practitioner Brian David Andersen, of the Tri Vortex Institute in Palm Desert, Calif., recalled that the measles has always been one of those maladies \u201cthat you get once in childhood, stay home a few days from school, and then you\u2019re naturally immune.\u201d He added, \u201cAll that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other vaccine skeptics really want are impartial, rigorous studies to fully determine vaccine ingredients and find out, once and for all, if the vaccines actually work and are worth all the expense and the risks they create.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole \u2018anti-vax\u2019 movement is really moving up and they\u2019re pushing back with fear,\u201d he told AFP, referring to the medical establishment\u2019s reaction\u2014with multi-billions of dollars at stake. Perhaps this explains the alarming encroachment of the \u201cmedical police state\u201d in places like New York City and California, where longstanding exemptions from vaccination requirements are being revoked, and \u201cnon-compliant\u201d parents are being threatened with fines and incarceration.\n\nMark Anderson is AFP\u2019s roving editor.
