UK claims they made the recipe in an hour with data from the CCP. \n\n \n\n Moderna, who never brought a product to market, was on the ropes, magically not only brought one in a world wide crises, but, remarkably, was able to manufacture them at rate they never had without error, and distribute them at sub zero temps with ease. \n\n \n\n So, while \"money\" is the most pedantic of explanations, it does not explain how the BILLIONS, not millions, but BILLIONS of doses were made with no errors, no mistakes, no bad batches, and then, remarkably, distributed around the world under the strictest of conditions - temp being one, then tracked to each person. \n\n \n\n The math to creating the BILLIONS of doses isn't plausible, neither is the distribution of BILLIONS of doses just like that. \n\n \n\n You draw your own conclusion, but incentivizing was done BEFORE the doses were created, before the BILLIONS of unproven, untested, emergency authorized usage doses were created out of thin air with no mistakes. \n\n \n\n Begs the question, what authority did pharma have to pay folks to push the jab? \n\n \n\n The math on that is improbable, given every other \"state of emergency\" generally leads to a clusterFk of mistakes, failures, complaints and what not. Yet, there were those jabs, at the ready, in parking lots, drug stores, home delivery in some cases, doctors offices, hospitals, army bases, around the world --- flawlessly, by the BILLIONS. \n\n \n\n They had Billions of extra bottled lying around? What happened to the other jabs while these jabs stopped the assembly lines? Vaccines are NOT mRNA, as such, the process for creation/checking etc. is different, so how did they just gear up like that?", "opengraph": {"image": "https://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats13.jpg", "title": "Anthem provider vaccine incentive program, page 1", "description": "Anthem provider vaccine incentive program, page 1", "site_name": "AboveTopSecret.com"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
