Someone who refuses to obey the order of a health official could receive a $500 fine, up to six months in jail or both.\n\nHowever, when a life-threatening disease is involved, the refusal to obey the order could include up to $5,000 in fines, five years of jail time or both.\n\nThe state has been struggling with a relatively low vaccination rate \u2014 only 37 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAs GreatGameIndia reported earlier, students at Connecticut\u2019s Quinnipiac University will be fined up to $2,275 and lose internet access if they fail to comply with the university\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination policies.\n\nMeanwhile, French Vaccine Police have started patrolling the streets of Paris enforcing a Virus Pass and slapping fines as high as 9,000 Euros.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://humansbefree.com/2021/08/covid-19-patients-who-refuse-to-self-isolate-will-be-sent-to-jail-for-5-years-in-mississippi.html", "site_name": "Humans Be Free", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:section": "Coronavirus", "title": "COVID-19 Patients Who Refuse to Self Isolate Will Be Sent to Jail for 5 Years in Mississippi", "description": "COVID-19 Patients Who Refuse to Self Isolate Will Be Sent to Jail for 5 Years in Mississippi", "image": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/COVID-19-Patients-Who-Refuse-to-Self-Isolate-Will-Be-Sent-to-Jail-for-5-Years-in-Mississippi-e1629828263659.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/COVID-19-Patients-Who-Refuse-to-Self-Isolate-Will-Be-Sent-to-Jail-for-5-Years-in-Mississippi-e1629828263659.jpg", "image:width": "907", "image:height": "510", "image:alt": "covid 19 patients who refuse to self isolate will be sent to jail for 5 years in mississippi"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">French <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vaccine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Vaccine</a> Police have started patrolling the streets of Paris enforcing a Virus Pass and slapping fines as high as 9,000 Euros.</p>\n<p>Read more \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd <a href=\"https://t.co/RTZBAm6KKx\">https://t.co/RTZBAm6KKx</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sYL6keizmr\">pic.twitter.com/sYL6keizmr</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreatGameIndia/status/1425107394074402819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/15485.pdf", "https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/15485.pdf", "https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/mississippi", "https://greatgameindia.com/", "https://greatgameindia.com/university-fine-block-internet-unvaccinated/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vaccine?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/RTZBAm6KKx", "https://t.co/sYL6keizmr", "https://twitter.com/GreatGameIndia/status/1425107394074402819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://greatgameindia.com/jjab-police-paris/", "https://greatgameindia.com/covid-19-patients-jail-mississippi/", "https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/15485.pdf"], "authors": ["HAF"], "publish_date": "2021-08-24T19:12:44"}
