Making a person\u2019s immune system more vulnerable. As public health officials continue to ramp up their COVID test and N95 disbursement efforts, let\u2019s pay close attention to when and whether evidence like this will be properly acknowledged and discussed.\n\nCAUTION: Getting the COVID shot causes \u201cconsistent pathophysiological alterations\u201d in the human immune system\n\nThe study in question was published in October 2021 in Cell Discovery and conducted by Chinese researchers from WIV.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know in this case, the researchers used a vaccine available in China called VeroCell. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), VeroCell \u201cis an inactivated vaccine \u2026 which [stimulates] the production of antibodies and [makes] the body ready to respond to an infection with live SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine is adjuvanted (with aluminum hydroxide), to boost the response of the immune system.\u201d\n\nWhile the WIV study is small and includes only 11 participants, it did generate some alarming conclusions regarding COVID shot safety. By assessing kidney function, blood work, and other metrics in the participants, the researchers determined that the shots clearly \u201cmimicked an infection\u201d with SARS-CoV-2 and led to \u201cconsistent alterations in gene expression of many different immune cell types.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese data,\u201d the authors write, \u201csuggested that after vaccination, at least by day 28, other than generation of neutralizing antibodies, people\u2019s immune systems, including those of lymphocytes and monocytes, were perhaps in a more vulnerable state.\u201d\n\nThey continue (with our emphasis added): \u201cOur study postulates that it is imperative to consider the potential long-term impact of vaccination to certain medical conditions or to general human health.\u201d\n\nThis study also adds context to the official position of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), who earlier this month stated that repeated COVID booster shots could impair immune response and lack feasibility as a public health measure.\n\nGrowing evidence of negative immune health effects caused by COVID shot raises yet another important ethical question that public health officials seem unwilling to address\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this scenario a bit more clearly:\n\nHere we have one of several scientific studies presenting evidence that COVID shots \u2013 which currently lack any and all long-term safety data \u2013 are associated with \u201cdramatic changes in immune cell gene expression\u201d that could actually impair a person\u2019s immunity, especially if that person has one or more chronic health conditions.\n\nNext, we need to consider an interesting trend in drug studies:\n\nUsually, only young and healthy volunteers are recruited to participate in clinical drug trials that purport to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug (as was the case for this study from WIV). Yet the majority of people who would be expected to take the drug \u2013 including a whopping 6 in 10 American adults with at least one chronic disease and nearly 43% of American adults with obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 are either older than 65 or not healthy by most definitions.\n\nThis brings up an important question:\n\nIf a growing amount of evidence suggests that COVID shots could plausibly cause long-term harm to immune health, particularly in people with chronic health conditions, isn\u2019t it unethical to coerce American citizens into taking them since the majority of these citizens live with at least one chronic health issue?\n\nHeart disease, cancer, kidney disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and chronic lung disease are rampant in this country. Shouldn\u2019t individuals living with these conditions get to choose whether they want to take their chances on the COVID shot in the hopes that the benefits of the drug will outweigh the risks? And regardless of health status or age, shouldn\u2019t everyone get to make that risk assessment for themselves and their children?\n\nIt truly has never been more important to improve your overall health and the health of your loved ones.
