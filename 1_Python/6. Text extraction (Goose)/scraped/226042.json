In a nursing home in the western German city of Oberhausen, several seniors experienced \u201cserious problems\u201d a few days after the Corona booster vaccination, reports the online German WDR public broadcasting.\n\n\u201cThree residents of the nursing home had to be resuscitated three days after the booster vaccination.\u201d 10% had to be medically treated.\n\n90 residents are reported to have received the third shot at the Oberhausen nursing home. According to WDR: \u201cOf these, nine had reactions so severe that they had to be treated,\u201d\n\nNow some physicians are now holding off until the Standing Commission on Vaccination (STIKO) of the Robert Koch Institute gives the official recommendation.\n\nIn Austria, online heute.at here reports 115 patients were recently in hospitals, 18 people are fighting for their lives, despite having been fully vaccinated against Corona.\n\nAccording to heute.at, \u201cCurrently 20 percent of those requiring hospital treatment are fully vaccinated against Covid 19 \u2013 or about 115 people.\u201d\n\nNote that \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d means having received the second shot at least 14 days prior. People who received their second shot only 10 days prior, for example, still count as \u201cunvaccinated\u201d.\n\nOnce touted as an immunization against the COVID 19 virus, officials are now hoping that repeated boosters will work. In Israel, for example, 25% of the population has already had 3 shots and now \u201cthe country\u2019s national coronavirus czar Salman Zarka said the country needs to prepare for a fourth injection, which could be modified to better protect against new variants of the virus,\u201d reports The Daily Mail.\n\nDespite mass vaccination, number of new cases in Israel reach a new high.
