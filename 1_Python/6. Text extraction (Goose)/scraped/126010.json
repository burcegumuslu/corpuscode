Dithiothreitol, which shows reducing activity equivalent to that of Asc Acid, did not affect endothelial permeability. Asc Acid induced a sixfold increase in collagen synthesis by the endothelial cells. The coexistence of L-azetidine 2-carboxylic acid, an inhibitor of collagen synthesis, attenuated the effect of Asc 2-P in a dose-dependent manner. Another collagen synthesis inhibitor, ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, also inhibited collagen synthesis and increased endothelial permeability. The decrease in permeability of the endothelial monolayer was dependent on a reduction of the permeability coefficient of the endothelial monolayer. These findings indicate that endothelial barrier function is stimulated by Asc Acid via an increase in collagen synthesis.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "I-RECOVER Post-Vaccine Archives - FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance", "url": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/reference-categories/i-recover-post-vaccine/", "site_name": "FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance"}, "tags": ["answering audience questions"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
