For example, the army of fact-checkers who keep Wikipedia accurate, hard-working journalists or scientific journals which are no longer limited by access to university libraries or subscriptions.\n\nThis is why you will always see my link directly to my sources when I write my articles about innovation and creativity. Evidence is of the upmost importance for you to trust what I write.\n\nBut unfortunately it is just as easy for anyone to make any claim they want, without any evidence to back it up. In some cases, lies and inaccurate information actually can be more appealing for certain people because it causes an emotional reaction rather than a rational one, allowing fake information to spread as it is shared between people\n\nAnd as a result, misinformation like anti-vaccine rumours can spread quickly over the internet.\n\nEspecially if it is designed in a \u201cshare-first, think later\u201d format like the image above.\n\nSo when you come across new ideas online, ask yourself three things:\n\u2022 Does this information have a credible source?\n\u2022 How does that source compare to other evidence from the scientific or journalistic community?\n\u2022 Who would benefit from sharing misinformation?", "opengraph": {"image": "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Images-11-Feb7.webp", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Don\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet", "description": "The internet can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to spreading ideas.", "url": "https://anonhq.com/dont-believe-everything-you-read-on-the-internet/", "site_name": "AnonHQ", "article:published_time": "2023-01-22T13:59:19+00:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.me/armyanonymous", "https://anonhq.com/support-us/", "https://www.ideatovalue.com/podc/nickskillicorn/2020/04/gemma-milne-podcast-23april/", "https://www.ideatovalue.com/insp/nickskillicorn/2021/02/cui-bono/", "https://www.patreon.com/armyanonymous\n", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10=", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10="], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2023-01-22T13:59:19+00:00"}
