Much hype has surrounded the vaccine despite many reports of serious adverse reactions following the jabs, both in girls and latterly boys, who are being targeted with the aim of protecting them from genital warts caused by HPV infection.\n\nIn 2011, attention turned to men who have sex with men (MSM) and in 2014 Gardasil 9 was approved for use in women and men aged 9-26 years in the US. In 2018, the jab\u2019s use was extended to cover men and women aged 27-45 years. As every effort has been expended by HPV manufacturers and health authorities to target the widest possible sector of the population, including in the so-called less developed world, few have been informed that approximately 90% of HPV infections resolve without any intervention.\n\nThere\u2019s other news, the vaccine makers would likely prefer the public didn\u2019t know: new evidence published in Lancet Oncology suggests that HPV vaccination makes women more susceptible than their unvaccinated peers to developing cancer caused by HPV variants not covered by vaccine covering HPV 16 and 18.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health - ANH Protects Free Speech About Natural Health Modalities, Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy, Homeopathy and Access To Natural Therapies.", "type": "article", "title": "More Concerns Over HPV Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness - Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health", "description": "The HPV vaccine is being hailed a success in preventing HPV related cancers yet statistics tell a very different story From ANH-International In early 2020, Cancer Research UK raised an alarm over the steep rise in rates of cervical cancer in women aged 25-29, which it attributed to low rates of screening.
