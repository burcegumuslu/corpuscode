Now, new research involving blood samples from vaxxed individuals suggests that COVID shots share at least one thing in common with the dozens of other jabs currently recommended for kids and adults by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 they, too, are loaded with toxic contaminants.\n\nIn a report called \u201cSummary of Preliminary Findings,\u201d a multidisciplinary team from Germany puts it bluntly: \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccination programmes must be stopped immediately.\u201d Keep reading to learn why they came to this sobering conclusion.\n\nThe German group, called the Working Group for Covid Vaccine Analysis, includes independent physicians, physicists, chemists, microbiologists, pharmacologists, alternative health practitioners, lawyers, psychologists, analysts, and journalists. Their report, published earlier this summer, is described as a \u201cpreliminary, continuously evolving presentation of our research and findings on the so-called COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the effects we found on the human body and the blood in particular. The summary is intended for the public interest and to encourage further scientific discussion.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s just some of what their report entails:\n\nAfter analyzing the COVID jabs from AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna \u2013 and analyzing blood samples from an admittedly small group of COVID vaxxed individuals (48) \u2013 the German researchers came to a variety of important conclusions.\n\nFirst, and \u201cwithout exception,\u201d all samples of COVID vaxxes tested contained substances at levels that are considered toxic \u201caccording to medical guidelines.\u201d Substances allegedly found in these shots include cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), potassium (K), cerium (Ce), gadolinium (Gd), silicon (Si), and sulfur (S).\n\nThese substances, which were mostly metallic, were seen under microscopic evaluation, despite the fact that they were \u201cnot declared by the manufacturers as present in the vaccines,\u201d the researchers say. The researchers add that the presence of these \u201cdistinctive and complex structures\u201d cannot be explained by \u201ccontamination\u201d during the manufacturing process, implying that the metallic compounds are there intentionally.\n\nAs for the mRNA shots specifically, the researchers also found that the \u201cgreater the stability of the envelope of lipid nanoparticles, the more frequent are vaccine side effects.\u201d In other words: more stable lipid nanoparticle components allow for more mRNA gene technology to penetrate human cells, \u201cwhere the production of spike proteins then takes place.\u201d Their results correspond with emerging data showing that both virus-induced and jab-induced spike proteins are harmful to human health.\n\nFor their research, the Working Group for Covid Vaccine Analysis used a variety of widely accepted modern medical techniques, including Dark Field Microscopy (DFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Mass Spectroscopy (MS), Inductively Coupled Plasma Analysis (ICP), Bright Field Microscopy (BFM), and Live Blood Image Diagnostic.\n\nVaxxed blood exhibits unusual changes, hinting at future long-term health consequences for jabbed individuals, including children\n\nAs for the blood of injected individuals, the German researchers found that \u201csamples of all the people who had been vaccinated showed marked changes.\u201d The researchers found \u201ccrystalline formations\u201d and \u201ccomplex structures similar to those in the vaccines\u201d in blood samples from vaxxed individuals. Notably, these blood changes were evident \u201ceven if those people hadn\u2019t at that point displayed any visible reaction to the vaccinations.\u201d\n\nThis last point clearly points to the worrisome possibility of future long-term health effects among jabbed individuals.\n\nIn their report, the Working Group for Covid Vaccine Analysis explains that they are \u201cexploring the hypothesis that arteriosclerosis could be just one of many long-term effects that those vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccines will have to face. If this hypothesis is confirmed, the consequences would be wide-reaching in terms of both health and socio-economics.\u201d\n\nThe researchers further hypothesize that the obvious changes in the blood induced by the COVID jabs could also \u201cplay a causal role\u201d in the development of autoimmune diseases and immune dysfunction, both of which can \u201clead to organ damage, high blood pressure, heart attacks, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and shorten life expectancy \u2026 At the very least, each one of our findings should result in the immediate suspension of the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in order to exclude the vaccines from reasonable suspicion.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to ensure that their work is seen, the group has shared their findings publically with at least 4,000 individuals, including the entire Lower House of Parliament in Germany and members of the German media.\n\nIn an article posted to Substack, internal medicine physician Dr. Ana Mihalcea, MD, says she is \u201chorrified\u201d by this data and calls it \u201ctranshumanist [artificial intelligence] agenda in full force.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Undisclosed Metals Found In COVID Shots | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) German group of doctors, scientists find undisclosed metals in blood samples of COVID jabbed individuals.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/blood-samples-of-covid-jabbed-contain-strange-crystalline-formations-scientists-reveal.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2022-10-03T05:11:10+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-10-03T02:26:33+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/iStock-1337631912.jpeg", "image:width": "1366", "image:height": "768", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://expose-news.com/2022/08/24/crystalline-objects-blood-vaccinated/", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/spike-proteins-in-covid-jabs-cause-organ-damage-3993.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/new-study-links-artificial-sweeteners-to-heart-attacks.html", "https://expose-news.com/2022/08/24/crystalline-objects-blood-vaccinated/", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/3-things-parents-should-know-about-toxic-heavy-metals-baby-foods", "https://www.ewg.org/sites/humantoxome/chemicals/chemical_classes.php?class=Metals", "https://anamihalceamdphd.substack.com/p/alarming-new-report-from-working"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2022-10-03T05:11:10+00:00"}
