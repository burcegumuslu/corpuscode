Today we\u2019re going to cover the movie, the hunt. So if you haven\u2019t seen the movie, I suggest it and I always got to give you my take on how much you should spend on this. Watch is this movie worth? Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I did. I rented it for 5.99 on Amazon watched it twice. Get like 48 hours to watch. I watched it twice. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I actually didn\u2019t think I was gonna enjoy it that much. But I really enjoyed it, I would say, you know, if they had it for sale for like 10 to 15 bucks, like that\u2019s a fair buy like I would, I would probably watch it again. I probably watch this thing over my lifetime, three to five times. So it\u2019s a very specific recommendation I\u2019ve got there so and look the movie, it hits all the things for me. It\u2019s 90 minutes, because all good movies are 90 all good books or 200. Movies 90. It\u2019s very gory, but it\u2019s pretty funny. Because it\u2019s kind of a satire horror movie. It\u2019s definitely not a movie for the whole family though. I mean, I don\u2019t know how you How weird your family gets but I would guess that this isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s something akin to Shaun of the Dead or Kill Bill, where like, there\u2019s lots of Gore. And it\u2019s all rated. But it\u2019s somehow like light hearted and doesn\u2019t really like I don\u2019t think is gonna give you nightmares. So it\u2019s in that vein. So decide what you want to do with that information. You can go watch it and come back. Or you can press on and just hear about the movie because it\u2019s actually quite applicable to world topics if you can believe that or not about the elites hunting down. Folks, humans, the ultimate hunt humans, so yeah, there\u2019s gonna be plot spoilers. So you\u2019ve been warned. Here we go. Now this film starts out and they get right into it. They get right into it. What we see basically is a bunch of people getting sort of abducted to be dropped off in a field much like sort of Hunger Games deal. They\u2019re not really sure why they\u2019re there, though. They drop a Well, before they get to that, I guess I should start out with. There\u2019s talk on some text messaging, they\u2019re using some coded language, right? Much like the WikiLeaks email of the pizza stuff. And these elites are talking about going out to the manor. Not to the manor to hunt deplorables Okay, clearly there\u2019s a there\u2019s a right wing left wing commentary on America here. If you go back to when Hillary Clinton called the right wingers deplorables, or some people that voted for Trump or something to that effect. It\u2019s a real trigger word for the right wingers. So this incident is tied into a thing called Manor gate in the movie it\u2019s a fictional event similar to the pizza And it\u2019s this conspiracy theory that the conspiracy theorists are floating around about how the elites hunt humans every year at the manor. Okay. So we are taken to a scene where they\u2019re on an airplane and we find out and one of the, you know, the elites, they\u2019re taking their private jet over to the manor because they\u2019re actually going to do this thing. And this guy\u2019s a real, you know, douchebag and he\u2019s talking to the stewardess and asked if she likes working for Athena. So we\u2019re first introduced to the idea that all these folks are working for a woman named Athena. And of course, you know where we\u2019re going with that. We\u2019ve got the wisdom goddess of Athena. She\u2019s the owl. She\u2019s the Minerva. She\u2019s the giant statue of the owl at Bohemian Grove that the elites go to to sacrifice kids to every year, allegedly Allegedly, we don\u2019t know if that happens. Eight 800,000 missing kids every year or whatever the number is 80,000 factor 10 off missing kids every year. Do some of them end up given to the owl God at Bohemian Grove. So here we go. So already we\u2019re already postured up. We know what\u2019s going on here. There\u2019s a little bit of a cult element there with Athena. Besides, have you ever met and Athena? Probably not, not a popular, not a very common name, I should say. So here\u2019s where we meet a theme because one of the abductees that\u2019s going to be hunted at the manor he\u2019s actually on the plane, but he\u2019s conked out. He\u2019s knocked out, but he comes to you know, they didn\u2019t give them enough of the, you know, GMO 5g kill grid. So it wakes up and he\u2019s Running out what the hell\u2019s going on, you know, freak it out. And we were introduced to Athena she comes out. She drives her heel right into his eyeball is all seeing eye. And I\u2019ll put photos on the Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt Leggett subscribe links in the show notes. Of course, as always, you gotta like and subscribe at otherwise, or Yeah, can you say it anymore? So tired of pitching it. But that\u2019s where I\u2019ve been putting all my images.

Then social media real and all that and I used to post blogs all the time. But now I\u2019m just putting the images to make it easy for you on social media. So go to the Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt You can find me on there your priority. Subscribe if you\u2019re tired of hearing me talk about it. I\u2019m going to stop here soon. I just need to get to 10,000 Okay, no Shut up. Kinda like the reviews. I need to get to 1000 reviews. Now shut up. Anyway, let\u2019s keep moving so she jams her heel right in is all seeing eye and she is clearly the leader of the group. She takes no shit. She is the one texting at the beginning of the movie. This is played by Hilary Swank. Okay. Then we see that the abductees are on a sort of giant farm ground with nothing but a big giant wooden case, big crate right in the center of it. So they go and they busted open and a pig comes running out a pig named Orwell. Now, most of you probably already pieced that together. But the pig represents Animal Farm the the novel by George Orwell, of course. But what\u2019s curious here, and well, we\u2019ll Well actually save that for the end we\u2019ll wrap up the discussion with my theories on this movie at the end. It\u2019s a big bombshell theory so stay tuned and look I don\u2019t know if someone already came up with some of this stuff. I literally listened to no reviews read nothing on this movie. Usually I do a little homework but as you are well aware 2020 is absolute insanity and I can\u2019t not do a show every single day. So I just watched the movie took my notes and here we are, watched it twice for you. Now this movie, it has lots of laws, lots of surprises laws as an lol Liu Ll lots of lols lots of surprises. If you\u2019re a right winger or if you find the the PC police and the hijacking of the liberal progressive system you like this movie? You\u2019re gonna like it. Think of your left wing or right wing or you would find this movie entertaining. And you\u2019ve got to look at the names on the IMDb if you do watch this movie the names of the abductees are quite, quite humorous vanilla nice with the with the itat of the state of Florida and as I but yoga pants yeah that they have the actress from American Horror Story The I don\u2019t remember her name. She goes by yoga pants on IMDB. I thought she was gonna be the this the all star the movie. She almost immediately gets bodied. There\u2019s political tone throughout the whole movie. The hunters there. The hunt so the hunters the elites here. Okay. It\u2019s clear that they\u2019re the liberal elite. They\u2019re talking about the rat faced commander in chief referring to Trump The old boy at the gas station that is in this little fake town, the manner I should say. He\u2019s talking about how climate change is real right before killing vanilla nice. And that this gas station, which is a prop sort of used in the manner the couple are discussing why the guy from New York, who\u2019s one of the abductees, I guess I should explain this in case you haven\u2019t seen it. My bad excuse me, let me back up. So they open the crate, the pig comes around and out. They get a bunch of guns. Then immediately the liberal elite starts shooting at them. And everyone scatters have them die right away. And they\u2019re sort of running away through this sort of wooded area. They find a gas station. They go in there. They think they\u2019re going to call for help. Well, they\u2019re not everything\u2019s set up. Everything\u2019s a stage. A couple work in there. They act like they\u2019re just like an innocent old couple. But it turns out they\u2019re part of the liberal elites. And then they start taking out all the people in there. And they kill all of them.\n\nYeah. Oh, come on, honey, tell me what\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s wearing a wedding ring. He\u2019s a monster. Honey. He probably uses the N word and not even in private. He probably uses it on Twitter. Those people suffered 400 years of bondage at the hands of that piece of shits ancestors those people sorry, black people.\n\nit\u2019s perfectly fine to call them black again.\n\nAccording to who?\n\nwhich consists almost exclusively of\n\nWere the fucking worst So, you know, they\u2019ve got this whole exchange about white privilege and race relations, which is curious because of the timing of this movie. This movie was supposed to drop in March 2020. Right when the world went upside down. Was this warning about the anti fur movement? Was there some awareness and again, I\u2019m going to defer to my final conclusion on the movie. Because I think it\u2019s relevant. And it\u2019s also curious that at one point, Richard goes to take a piss and he asks for some hand sanitizer. Now, it\u2019s not unheard of to see hand sanitizer in a movie, but I\u2019ll tell you I, I find it curious. Okay, that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say. Find it very curious. Then, a character named Gary played by Ethan sub From some great movies this guy\u2019s from American History X mall rats. Wolf of Wall Street actually went to Asbury Park. I, as you know, I\u2019m an East Coast guy originally. And I went out to Asbury Park and saw where they filmed clerks. I was in there. I was inside the gas station. I mean, this was probably, I don\u2019t know 10 years ago. It\u2019s no promises if it\u2019s still there. They seem to give zero shits about clerks being filmed there, but I sure enjoyed it. And you can even go to Jay and Silent Bob\u2019s secret stash I went in there saw What\u2019s his name? Flanagan what Flanagan saw him in there. Anyway, where were we? Oh, yeah. Okay, so Ethan sadly he\u2019s in this movie too. And, and his name is Gary. Okay. And he he\u2019s got a theory on this. This is where we learn about the conspiracy theory of Manor gate and the the deep state globe, globalist and all this so they listen.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they just kill you when you came in? I don\u2019t care.\n\nI want to hear my theory.\n\nread that article. Every year these liberal elites, you know the globalists cooks who run the deep state kidnap bunch of normal folks like us and harness for fucking sport and like, this mansion in Vermont or something. I thought about 250 friends. It\u2019s not like I believed it. You believe\n\nthat you have 50 friends? No,\n\nSo we\u2019re introduced to Crystal she\u2019s the main character here. Okay, crystal and Gary. they team up crystals The only one was sort of like mega through this. this farce at the gas station she kept the old people and her and Gary are on the on the move there and they see a train coming. They hop on the train and inside the train car there are a bunch of like immigrants, sir. And Gary instantly thinks they are crisis actors used to trick people into sympathizing for immigrants. JACK what?\n\nThey\u2019re not real. Ah, no we have here crisis actor in fact look like totally cannot change is the one train car with the open doors full of illegals. I mean, you look at these fucks little obvious Don\u2019t you think in the necessity How much are you Fox trying to teach us a lesson?\n\nso sorry for immigrants and refugees.\n\nI\u2019m gonna have to rethink my entire position on immigration\n\nhere and they kind of made me.\n\nSo the train stops and the sort of military police are checking everything out. There\u2019s a bit of back and forth. But we find out Gary\u2019s got a podcast. He\u2019s a conspiracy. podcaster I found that extremely humorous. where we are, but\n\nI\u2019m an American. American American. Yeah. Yeah. Her to look. Let me explain everything, sir, because I know exactly what\u2019s going on here. Okay. These are not real refugees. These are crisis actors. I have a podcast I\u2019ve been exposing these people, okay. They were placed on the train as a part of Manor gate. This is all been an elaborate trap to try to ensnare us\n\nto Sociology. I mean, there\u2019s no full stop, because it\u2019s a marriage case. Um,\n\nI don\u2019t think they believe you Gary. Did you hear\n\nhim? Did you hear? Did you hear him?\n\nYou\u2019re fake, you\u2019re fake. If you did,\n\nthen, you know things go down. And we we talk about how well in the movie like they were given weapons, right? And there\u2019s a little bit of discussion on why would they give us weapons if they\u2019re trying to kill us. And I think that has something to do with that weird sort of karmic thing, this karmic agreement where they have to sort of tell you what they\u2019re going to do. They have to give you the sort of free will to go along with the program. Right. So Gary and crystal, they end up in the sort of refugee camp of sorts. They\u2019re trying to explain that they\u2019ve they\u2019re being hunted as as human prey. And we find out they\u2019re like in a foreign country. And there\u2019s a third guy who\u2019s in the same boat that they already caught. So they\u2019ve got three abductees, right. Well, the embassy, the US Embassy comes to get them. And sure enough, what do you know? This guy\u2019s part of the elite programming, and Krystal, she\u2019s the she\u2019s the real Athena here. She kind of has the wisdom. She knows all. She sees through the lies of the embassy guy who comes to drive them away to go towards the embassy, presumably. And it\u2019s funny because she, she catches on to it because they\u2019re having a conversation and The the liberal elite guys as somebody who\u2019s who\u2019s posing as an embassy guy, he suggests that he would never blame the victim. And that\u2019s what triggers her to understand that, oh, he\u2019s part of the liberal elite. So she takes him out. Then she basically goes to counter attack all these liberal elites. And she makes her way up all the way to the top to Athena. And before that, we get some flashbacks. Okay. We have some flashbacks. And we find out that Athena The reason she\u2019s doing all this, she\u2019s the CEO of a company. And this company is worried about the optics, she\u2019s got this partner Paul, who\u2019s kind of implying that they already canceled the other guy who works there. And she\u2019s gonna have to get canceled too, because she was talking about Manor gate on the text message, which is this point, a big conspiracy, that he even tells you. It\u2019s on Reddit, and there\u2019s Truth is digging up all the property information.\n\nNearly critical things about the president.\n\nWell, last I heard free speech still exists. Don\u2019t do that.\n\nDon\u2019t Don\u2019t first amendment me, please. It\u2019s not a country. It\u2019s a business. A business and their optics.\n\nNo, he realized he had to take one for the team.\n\nteam. We have a team, our team. What\u2019s in the file, Nicole? Just say\n\nDo you recall a text thread you had with Martin, Peter, Richard and liberty amongst others? December 17. At 10 o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\nI don\u2019t recall the text that I had last fucking Tuesday. Paul.\n\nMartin, Did anyone see what our rat fucker in chief just did? liberty. Yes, day equals ruined. Peter, infuriating. Athena. At least the hunts coming up. Nothing better than going out to the mountains. And slaughtering a dozen deplorables Miranda, we promised not to talk about the manner on text, Ted. Viva almanor Liberty deleting this thread\n\nAre you aware there\u2019s an active group of people out there believe this is a real thing. Believe\n\nwhy it\u2019s a real thing that you\u2019re hunting human beings for sport.\n\nYeah, conspiracy websites are all over. They\u2019re gone bananas. They\u2019re gone berserk, Reddit. I mean, I don\u2019t know the names of them all. But anyway, somebody pulled a property tax record for the manner that you bought in Vermont manner.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t own a fucking Manor in Vermont.\n\nIt\u2019s a three bedroom house. Jesus I can\u2019t believe you use that word.\n\nmanner. No deplorables it\u2019s church. Well I initially type fucking rednecks but then I decided that wasn\u2019t specific\n\non but what would you prefer? I call them Paul Gunn clutching homophone you stop please academically challenged racist. Hey, what about tos deprived Bay\n\never best team at reputation management flooding, flooding the search engines in the hopes this thing doesn\u2019t go mainstream but even if by some miracle it doesn\u2019t, and I really don\u2019t see that happening. Martin did what he had to Richard did what he had to he\u2019s at a blue s. Julius and Miranda had to step down from their foundation Liberty accident for fun I\u2019m sorry.\n\nYou got to go.\n\nSo again, a little bit of reflecting of reality there because that is in fact how this works. The conspiracy troopers are will get on the forums and start digging up all these texts and emails and leaked things and hacks. into stuff and anonymous and all that. And so at this point in the movie, we\u2019re a little fuzzy, we\u2019re like, well, was this a real thing was mandated real thing? Or was it faked? And then later these liberally leads decided, you know what, we\u2019re gonna make this conspiracy a reality and then they decided to do it. It\u2019s kind of one of the lingering questions of the movie. And we see that before they decided to do the manor gate thing. We see all these liberal elites in the room in a flashback and they\u2019re talking about how they\u2019re going to get all the troopers and conspiracy types who\u2019ve been pushing the manor gate and even pizza type stuff into the hunt. Could it be this is a subtle warning to people that are talking about these subjects. This will fit into my conclusion which is coming up real soon. We\u2019re almost through the whole movie and that great. So Athena and crystal meetup crystal makes it all the way to the final boss here. And Athena is telling crystal about how her and all her tutor buddies are making something out of nothing. This is during the the big grilled cheese speeches has crystal calls it and then Athena says that they wanted man OR gate to fit the conspiracy triggers backwards, backwards worldview. So they chose to pursue it.\n\nmonths ago you posted this on a message board under the screen name justice for y\u2019all. I want to make sure I get it exactly right. This bitch, Athena stone murders innocent men and women for sport evidence is all there to H EI are her manner her travel records. Oh and in case you were still on the fence she fucking admitted to it in a text message\n\nhuh huh that\u2019s all you have to say for yourself. Everybody you kidnapped and killed\n\nas because they busted you and your friends and put it on the internet no one busted us. We were joking, but you ignored them I took it literally you actually believed we were hunting human beings for sport. But you are what? human beings for sport? No. Yeah, it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nThis your manner and it\u2019s not a fucking manner. It\u2019s a house I rented in Croatia and had decorated with a rat but it\u2019s yours in your hand. People So it\u2019s\n\nI mean, it\u2019s true now. Now it\u2019s true because you made it true to people you anything you want, and you twist it around until it fits into your backwards fucking worldview. You wanted it to be true. So you decided it was\n\nSo right at the end, Crystal asks why they\u2019ve been referring to her as snowball. And Athena tries to tell it will snowball as the idealist of the whole story and suggest that it should have been her she\u2019s the idealist, Athena is then we also find out that it\u2019s the wrong crystal they grabbed the wrong woman. And this is very indicative of the Uber communist mega progressiveness that we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few years. It can canceled culture where they\u2019re just canceling people, regardless of if there\u2019s been an actual crime committed, regardless of if it really happened or not. And this idea of just destroying everything taken down, even unintentional targets just like crystal unintended collateral damage\n\nshe gets into a nice little fight and she wins. And now she\u2019s the winner. She puts on the nice dress, she grabs the, you know, the heels and all that. And she sees the rabbit. She\u2019s walking out towards this private plane and she sees the the rabbit and this was a reference to an earlier tale she had. It\u2019s the hare the tortoise tail right where The idea is like, the tortoise is way slower than the rabbit, but the rabbit gets cocky and takes a little nap. And the turtle, the tortoise just keeps pushing through. And he actually wins. He wins the race. A story about persistence. Now she when she tells the story in the middle of the movie, she talks about how, you know, the rabbit says he\u2019s the fastest and it\u2019s true. But the the turtle decides he wants to race this rabbit anyhow. The rabbit wants to really put on a show because he\u2019s so so cocky, so confident. So he stops, he takes a nap. But he over sleeps. He wakes up and realizes that the turtle one now this is where the normal story ends, but she continues, she says, but then the turtle was telling his family at dinner about persistence and how they\u2019re how he won how he beat the rabbit was you just get Gotta keep trying. But then the rabbit smashes the door and bashes up the turtle family with the hammer and eats him for dinner. And I think what they\u2019re trying to say here and this fits into the idea of why they, you know, they, they accidentally grabbed the wrong crystal because in their zealous quest for equality and proper political correctness, everything\u2019s getting burned down along the way. It\u2019s like, they\u2019re the biggest judges of everyone with good intentions, sure. But it never seems to work out the way it should, when looking for a quality and all that. So crystal gets on the private plane, the one that Athena flew in and one that Athena has smashed dude in the eyeball with, with her hail, and she sits down and invites the storm To over to try to caviar for the first time. So it seems on some weird level, the political parties are flipping, which takes me to the conclusion here. Okay, this is what it\u2019s all about. This is my opinion here. It\u2019s a commentary a little bit on politics about the blurring of the right wing and the left wing and the two political parties sort of Trading Places. It used to be that the left wing was more about free speech and, you know, do what you want, so that so that, so long as you\u2019re not harming another adult. And this isn\u2019t this isn\u2019t new. But now, you know, the liberals are, they\u2019re more of like censoring everybody. And this isn\u2019t a new theme. The political parties have actually switched stances of like, progressive versus conservative views over the last, you know, a couple hundred years. It\u2019s true But the real strange part here, and this is the part that I think is very odd. We got to go back to that Animal Farm story if you\u2019re not familiar with it, George Orwell, he wrote this novel called an animal farm in the 1940s. And it\u2019s a farm where the animals rebel against the human farmer. And they want to equal society. But they got like, sort of differing viewpoints and how to make that happen. And there\u2019s two liter pigs that come out. There\u2019s Napoleon and snowball, which is where we get the snowball name for crystal. But these two liter pigs sort of rise to the top. But Napoleon ultimately wins. He\u2019s using force. He\u2019s a dictator to get his way. It\u2019s like by God, you will do this for the sake of everyone. Some people get punished for the sake of everyone in the whole society to keep things Even Stephen, to keep everyone happy. So Napoleon becomes a dictator, whereas snowball, on the other hand is well intentioned, wants to help everyone keep everyone nice and even any kind of new technologies we all get to share in the, in the, you know, great things that the technology brings in that sort of thing, whereas Napoleon\u2019s a little dirty. But it shows how this kind of happens. It starts out with a socialism sort of cause and eventually makes way for a dictatorship. It\u2019s kind of like this COVID mass thing, right? Like everyone needs to wear the mask is what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019m just, you know, don\u2019t shoot the messenger. They say everyone needs to wear the mask outside. But like some folks, some leaders in government, you know, state government, the federal government, they all want the decision. To be made by the people to make the right choice. For instance, I live in Utah right now. And our governor has basically, you know, the stance it is, what the way it\u2019s been is let the people do the right thing, because they don\u2019t want to make a regulation a law because that\u2019s a slide towards dictatorship. But on the other hand, not everyone wants to wear the mask. They\u2019re not doing what\u2019s right, according to the science and the latest claims of wearing masks. Not everybody is doing it. They\u2019re not doing the responsible thing. And it\u2019s like the shopping cart theory. There\u2019s no law that says you got to take that shopping cart all the way back to the thing. It\u2019s just the right thing to do. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing it. But do do the people. Do what\u2019s Write for others or do you need to make a law and then regulate people and imprison them? You know, it\u2019s kind of a balance we play here in America. How do we get off on that? We got off the rails. Yeah, anyway, so like snowballs, kind of more like, oh everyone you know, love wears like, Napoleon\u2019s more like, the dictator that\u2019s like, no, you\u2019re gonna make a law you\u2019re gonna wear the mask. And if you don\u2019t wear the mask, we\u2019ll find you. We\u2019re gonna throw you in prison. It\u2019s for everyone\u2019s it\u2019s for the best for everyone. You got to do it. So there\u2019s two views of this whole thing? Because if you\u2019re one of those people out there that wears a mask and sees all the people that don\u2019t you think, hey, idiot, what are you doing? Like I\u2019m out here suffering wearing this stupid mask. You put the dumb mask on to that\u2019s how this works. How many times do you got to be told to do this? Before they make us do this? Right. And that\u2019s not a commentary on mask. I know. There\u2019s, I bet I\u2019m gonna guess 80% sense of the audience here is anti mask. I\u2019m going to guess that knowing the truth or community I already know. And look, I\u2019m right there with you, man. I don\u2019t believe these people know of a mask works or not. And what\u2019s preposterous is that they never took the time to study this. They knew about pandemics for forever, never spent a nickel on study that makes no damn sense to me. They\u2019re lying to us left and right. So I don\u2019t trust them either. I trust none of these people. However, I do know that when people talk they spit. So the question is this Cova transfer through the spit? I mean, they don\u2019t seem to know anything about anything. They change their mind they flip flop 180 degrees on everything. So to me like I put the damn mask on, I put it on. You know why? Because a I don\u2019t want that sketchy Bill Gates, accelerated DNA, vaccine RNA vaccine whatever be I don\u2019t want to force local leaders and government to become dictators. They say hey we want you to do this because this will lower the transmission whether I believe that or not I kind of I\u2019m like okay, that\u2019s cool you\u2019re not being a dictator because I\u2019m very much against authoritarianism and dictatorship. But I get it you know, I get if you\u2019re an anti master I understand. I\u2019m actually working on making masks and if you know that for my red bubble store, air I love it. I\u2019m going to post it on Instagram. When I get this cool mask that I built. Now that I\u2019m supportive of the mass I again, you know, you know my opinion all that. I don\u2019t know if I believe it. I support those that you know, don\u2019t want to wear it like I\u2019m okay with that. I get it. They haven\u2019t made it very clear. This is on their on them. But I also don\u2019t want them to To get a taste of that dictatorship and keep it rolling, start interfering too much in our lives, right? Anyway, cheese, I\u2019m so tired of talking about COVID and mass are talking about the movie here we\u2019re talking about hunt the hunt. Okay, so the pigs, bah, bah, bah, two different political sort of factions of this idea of how to keep everyone\u2019s, you know, equal on equal footing socialism. But it turns out bad. Napoleon becomes a dictator pig is socialism ultimately turns out to be that that\u2019s what this story tells us. Now, this book, written by George Orwell, it becomes an animated British film in the 1950s, the biggest animated British film of all time. It\u2019s like their version of Disney. But the reason that became so was that the CIA in America got the rights to the book through Orwell\u2019s widow sign You Orwell, in exchange for her to have a meeting with Clark Gable. Because you see the CIA, through like project Mockingbird, and all this other stuff. They had people embedded in Hollywood, working undercover. And they did this as a form of propaganda to convince the world that communism was bad and evil. And it always gives way to dictatorships. It was anti Soviet propaganda, because this is the 1950s, Cold War, all that stuff. Because that was their big thing. And then look, they know this stuff. And this is the whole purpose of the podcast and all my books and everything. It all comes to a head here with the idea that entertainment is far more influential than we give it credit for the symbolism, the ideas. They\u2019re very powerful. Why do you think the CIA is in Hollywood, hiding out and doing sneaky things to push messages? left and right and all this stuff. Now, what\u2019s curious here? Because that\u2019s not the bombshell quite yet. We\u2019re coming up on it. Remember earlier we talked about the this was supposed to be released in March 2020, which means it was filmed prior to that 2019 and they\u2019re sort of understanding about antiva. About the the extreme left movement that was, you know, that erupted in was in May of 2020. Here, June 2020. Was it warning about the anti fur movement somehow on some weird level? was it was it being is it being used as a warning, movie warning. I mean, much like they how they warned they were trying to warn us about the dangers of communism, with the film version of Animal Farm the CIA was trying to scare us. Are they trying to scare conspiracy and conspiracy truth or folks not to talk about these things because that\u2019s who gets sucked into this is human hunting ground. The conspiracy folks that are spreading the truth about the elites through Manor gate. I think it\u2019s an analogy, saying, hey, troopers, you better stop talking about the pizza gate. Because this is where you end up. Hahaha. I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to show us here a direct metaphor for what they\u2019re going to do. They\u2019re going to, they\u2019re going to take us out man. Now, should you think I\u2019m crazy? On July 21. Twitter announced that they\u2019re going to ban all QA on accounts. And you know, I\u2019m not a QA none, guy.\n\nBut that\u2019s what they said.\n\nClearly, and you know, you go back to, you know, the days when they banned me from YouTube, all the conspiracy folks got banned from YouTube. Conspiracy people get banned left and right all over the place. Which is pretty wild. Right? For what for talking about conspiracy theories. Isn\u2019t that silly? Well, I think it\u2019s because the truth or movement is been so well coordinated. That now it\u2019s a real threat. It\u2019s a legitimate domestic threat on some levels. And I think this movie is trying to scare us. Now, finally. Finally, let me wrap this with a bow. What\u2019s curious about all this? If you go back to the Animal Farm movie, the CIA embedded in Hollywood and the operation to fund this movie to scare everyone out of liking communism, do you know who was the man that coordinate made it all that the man who ran the entire operation he Howard hunt the Watergate criminal. So there\u2019s the connection. He Howard hunt, Animal Farm, the hunt. See it\u2019s all connected there. It\u2019s a little play on words. If you know how to put the pieces together, you got the movie, the hunt that has all these references to animal farm was snowball and the pig name or well, and it\u2019s got all this talk about sort of left wing versus right wing principles. And you go back to the animal form propaganda movie that was basically ran by he Howard hunt. Or they outright telling us that the CIA funded this movie as well. And this movie is a warning to all the troops or communities about what their fate could be. If they decided to be so So that\u2019s the film The hunt. I enjoyed it thoroughly ominous threats from the powers that be aside, I thought was very entertaining. So let me know what you think. I am curious to hear what you think about this when I do read most of your comments. I read most of your messages Well, maybe not most your messages. My Instagram dm box is like insanely full. Especially but you got to get on Patreon for sure reading all the Patreon messages, all the Patreon comments I read all of them every single one of them. Let me know what you think. Am I off base here? Am I making things up? Am I finding something where there\u2019s nothing? Do you think that the CIA was involved with this movie? Do you think they\u2019ve been putting thinly veiled threats in here against the truth or community for sticking their nose in places that they shouldn\u2019t have? have gone? Because I mean, you look at those pizza emails. Clearly. There\u2019s some kind of coded language going on. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sacrificing kids the mall lock for adrenochrome but it\u2019s something and they clearly didn\u2019t want anyone to look into that because they didn\u2019t.
