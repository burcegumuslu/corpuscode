He elaborated on this during the Oct. 22 episode of \u201cPrather Point\u201d on Brighteon.TV.\n\nPrather cited a number of examples where large-scale actions by empires worldwide failed to eradicate small groups completely. While the actions initially impacted the small groups, they eventually took over in the long run and dominated the larger entity.\n\n\u201cRome had streets with burning Christians by the hundreds. Now it is a Catholic capital. The Aztecs sliced out still-beating hearts by the thousands, but the free tribes are still here. The Nazis skinned Jews to make lampshades, but synagogues still stand. Tribal Africans were sold in slave ships, but now their descendants captain the American fleet,\u201d Prather says.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose our republic in front of the scene, and we\u2019re not going to gain it back in front of the scene. That is how we will defeat this deep state tyranny \u2013 because they can\u2019t stop all of us. This is how the pioneers, the states and the tribes survived: They were decentralized. Everybody decentralizing their effort, but working together is very important to understand.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prather, the U.S. only has much experience in fourth-generation warfare, i.e. guerrilla war or insurgency war. \u201cWe actually started out that way with Native Americans fighting against the British. The tribes survived that way. And now, we are beginning another war in the continental U.S. \u2013 but it\u2019s primarily non-kinetic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s difficult to understand that we have been involved in a fifth-generation war. Fifth-generation warfare is very hard to even identify as warfare. It doesn\u2019t look like that.\u201d\n\nPrather talks about the push and pull of cultural changes\n\nThe \u201cPrather Point\u201d host noted that fifth-generation warfare involves changing the enemy\u2019s culture by means of infiltration and switching. He mentioned the Biden administration\u2019s opening of the southern border to illegal immigrants and those engaged in drug and human trafficking as an example of this change. Prather also pointed out how terrorists posing as Afghan refugees are being flown in to different U.S. cities.\n\nHe also mentioned the promotion of Dr. Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, to a four-star admiral under the U.S. Public Health Service. According to CBS News, the former Pennsylvania health secretary is the first openly transgender four-star officer in the country\u2019s uniformed services.\n\nPrather said: \u201cWhen you see Rachel Levine, a man who has transitioned to be a woman, now promoted, who\u2019s castrated and probably taking hormone drugs, wearing a wig and trying to say that boys are girls [and] girls are boys \u2013 that\u2019s trying to change the culture.\u201d (Related: Biden picks transgender who encouraged Covid-safe orgies as assistant health secretary.)\n\nThe \u201cPrather Point\u201d host also mentioned different officials pushing back against this cultural change. According to Prather, this pushback constitutes a kind of insurgent warfare that does not involve active, offensive maneuvers against enemies.\n\nThe Brighteon.TV host quoted Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who said that any Border Patrol agents terminated by the Biden administration will be taken in by the state. \u201cIf they are at risk of losing their job because of a president who is abandoning his duty to secure the border, they have a job in the state of Texas. I will hire you to help Texas secure our border,\u201d Abbott said.\n\n\u201cThose are federal government jobs, but they are taking them on. So that\u2019s what insurgent warfare really is. But it\u2019s a different kind of warfare,\u201d Prather said. (Related: Whistleblower: Biden has given official notice demanding border patrol agents get vaccinated (or be fired).)\n\nHe also mentioned the efforts of conservative organizations Judicial Watch and Project Veritas against this cultural change. Prather comments however: \u201cJudicial Watch is great, but they just do Freedom of Information [Act] requests and then it kinds of stops there. Project Veritas \u2026 [exposes] the corruption, hypocrisy, lies and betrayals of the left, but then it kind of stops there.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cPrather Point\u201d host said: \u201cHistorically, there were non-violent insurgent movements. This is exactly how the Christians overtook Rome on about 313 A.D. \u2013 it took that long. It was still fourth-generation insurgent warfare, it was non-kinetic [and] non violent, but it could not be stopped. The Romans had no way to counteract that.\u201d\n\nHe cited the crucifixion of Christ and the crucifixion of Spartacus, the gladiator who led slaves against Rome. \u201cSpartacus used kinetic means against the Roman Empire. [But] they understood counter-insurgency \u2026 [and] they were able to crush Spartacus\u2019 movement. Jesus Christ used insurgent tactics that they could not crush, and that is \u2018love your neighbor\u2019 and \u2018pray for your enemies.'\u201d\n\nWatch the full Oct. 22 episode of \u201cPrather Point\u201d below. \u201cPrather Point\u201d with Jeffrey Prather airs every Friday at 10\u201311 a.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nRevolt.news has more articles about how America can be reclaimed through non-violent means.", "opengraph": {"title": "Jeffrey Prather: Culture change is part of fifth-generation warfare \u2013 Brighteon.TV", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2021-10-27-prather-point-culture-change-fifth-generation-warfare.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "For\u00a0former intelligence officer Jeffrey Prather, culture change is a part of fifth-generation warfare.
