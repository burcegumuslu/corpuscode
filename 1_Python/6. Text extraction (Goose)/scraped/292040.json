As of writing, two researchers have come forward to share their findings.\n\nMasataka Nagao of Hiroshima University\u2018s School of Medicine highlighted how the bodies of vaccinated persons he autopsied with the help of police officers were abnormally warm. He said: \u201cThe first concern was that the body temperatures of the corpses were very high.\u201d According to Nagao, the bodies he autopsied had temperatures between 33 and 34 C (91 to 93 F).\n\nOther bodies he examined had temperatures above normal, with one example measuring more than 40 C (104 F). Based on this, Nagao concluded that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine causes immune system abnormalities that prompt inflammation throughout the body \u2013 causing the high temperatures.\n\nMeanwhile, dermatology expert Shigetoshi Sano of Kochi University\u2018s School of Medicine recounted finding SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins at the site of skin lesions on vaccinated patients.\n\n\u201cThe spike protein derived from the vaccine was found in the skin,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cSpike proteins are locally suppressing the immune system. As a result, the spike proteins facilitate in reactivation of the herpes virus.\u201d\n\nthis, Sano remarked that the spike proteins also prompt inflammation that can lead to blood clots. \u201cEven worse, spike proteins can also locally induce inflammation,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should say this, but it has been found that vaccinated people are more likely to get [COVID-19] than unvaccinated people. Sometimes, things that are not good are introduced into the human body. Vaccination may cause our overall immune system to fail to fight against such bad things.\u201d\n\nThe investigations conducted by Nagao and Sano followed a strong rebuke by Kyoto University professor emeritus Dr. Masanori Fukushima against the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for refusing to stop the country\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination program.\n\n\u201cPeople are already doing research all over the world,\u201d he told authorities during a January 2023 conference. \u201cYou have vaccinated so many people. And yet only 10 percent of the members of the MHLW \u2013 who are leading members of the vaccine campaign \u2013 have been vaccinated. Is this a joke?\u201d\n\nBack in November of last year, Fukushima expressed opposition to the COVID-19 vaccines during a conference convened by concerned citizen Kazuhisa Ukawa.\n\n\u201cVaccine damage is now a global problem,\u201d the professor emeritus said. \u201cAll those who have fallen ill after being vaccinated should not delay informing their medical institution. Don\u2019t be slow.\u201d\n\nFukushima continued: \u201cGiven the wide range of adverse events, billions of lives could ultimately be in danger.\u201d Some of the serious reactions he mentioned were cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and susceptibility to infection.\n\n\u201cDue to vaccination, natural immunity has been suppressed. This is what happened. I don\u2019t think it will subside at all; it will spread more and more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost people already have post-vaccination infections. The people who have the disease right now are not the ones who haven\u2019t been vaccinated, but the ones who have been vaccinated.\u201d\n\nHe then directed his words at MHLW: \u201cYou spend trillions of yen importing [COVID-19 vaccines] and inciting the population [to get vaccinated]. In professional magazines, the misunderstanding has come to light and now it is understood how dangerous [these vaccines are].\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\u2022 Fact-Checkers Admit 92% of All COVID Deaths Are From Jabbed People\n\u2022 Swedish study says Children who catch a Cold without Vaccines develop Natural Immunity\n\u2022 Japanese Officials Urge Govt To Tell The Truth About Excess Deaths Following Covid Vaccines\n\u2022 You're far more likely to die from covid 'vaccines' than from covid itself\n\nDid you like this information?
