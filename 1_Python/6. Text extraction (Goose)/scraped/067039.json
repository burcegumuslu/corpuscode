It guides our relations with society, and while we can\u2019t claim to have been always perfect in this regard, we feel strongly about respecting the rights of our neighbors and fellow citizens, and not imposing our own religious choices on others. Love for family, neighbor, community and the world is at the core of our values just as in most other churches.\n\nThese values apply to choices relating to medical care and the issues raised in the current health insurance debate. The denomination doesn\u2019t dictate in these matters either to its own members or to others. Long before the Affordable Care Act, for example, the church\u2019s headquarters made available medical insurance benefits for those of its employees who wished to have this coverage.\n\nWe don\u2019t see this as a contradiction of our Christian commitment or healing ministry. It\u2019s just a matter of respect and consideration for valued colleagues. It would be surprising if business owners who are Christian Scientists didn\u2019t naturally share this respect for the rights of their employees.The same values extend to issues of public health and safety. From the early years of our church\u2019s history, obedience to law has been foundational to the practice of Christian Science. We\u2019ve conscientiously sought to observe reporting, vaccination, and other public health requirements mandated by law or considered necessary for the protection of public health in specific situations.\n\nThe religious accommodations in regard to vaccination that exist in a number of states reflect this history. As the Massachusetts Department of Public Health noted in a column in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1974, the accommodation of Christian Scientists as a religious minority has been based on a tradition of \u201cmutual tolerance\u201d and shared underlying values. \u201cIn modern practice,\u201d the column pointed out, the denomination \u201chas also drawn a careful distinction\u201d between legitimate respect for religious practice and \u201cwhat society may reasonably expect [an individual] to do for the general good\u2026\" (\u201cChristian Science and Community Medicine,\u201d 2/14/1974, 401-2).\n\nIn this spirit, we see respect for our neighbors\u2019 concerns being as valid as respect for the concerns of a spouse or family member of a different faith. The common good includes everyone. And so we can understand the public health concerns that have been raised in recent years by the larger number of exemptions from vaccination being claimed for non-religious reasons.\n\nThe practice of spiritual healing is a conscientious choice for Christian Scientists. Countercultural as it may seem in today\u2019s world, it isn\u2019t the narrow religious stereotype often assumed. It isn\u2019t a dogma that can or should be imposed by church fiat, but a heartfelt practice rooted in love and \u201ccommon humanity\u201d (as the church\u2019s founder put it more than a century ago). While laws and conditions may change over time, we continue to be grateful for the tradition of mutual tolerance and respect that makes the working out of honest differences possible in a diverse democratic society.\n\nRead this post and more on our Facebook page.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Christian Science", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.christianscience.com/press-room/christian-scientists-and-respect-for-the-rights-of-others2", "ezObjID": "8504", "image": "https://www.christianscience.com/var/cscom/storage/images/media/images/masthead-images/generic-banner-light-and-color-reflected-thinkstockphotos-87727786/577-2-eng-US/generic-banner-light-and-color-reflected-thinkstockphotos-87727786.jpg?v3.6.88", "image:height": "200", "image:width": "1300", "title": "Christian Scientists and respect for the rights of others", "type": "website"}, "tags": ["Find a Sunday School", "Find a Christian Science Nurse", "Find a church", "Find a Reading Room", "Find a Christian Science Organization", "Find a Christian Science Practitioner"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.facebook.com/ChristianScienceCommitteeOnPublication/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
