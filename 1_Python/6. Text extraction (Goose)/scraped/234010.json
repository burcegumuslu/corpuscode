It refers to what the experts are touting as the next generation of immunizations.\n\nInstead of injecting a piece of a virus into a person, in order to stimulate the immune system, synthesized genes would be shot into the body. This isn\u2019t traditional vaccination anymore. It\u2019s gene therapy.\n\nIn any such method, where genes are edited, deleted, added, no matter what the pros say, there are always \u201cunintended consequences,\u201d to use their polite phrase. The ripple effects scramble the genetic structure in numerous unknown ways.\n\nHere is the inconvenient truth about DNA vaccines\u2014\n\nThey will permanently alter your DNA.\n\nThe reference is the New York Times, 3/15/15, \u201cProtection Without a Vaccine.\u201d It describes the frontier of research\u2014the use of synthetic genes to \u201cprotect against disease,\u201d while changing the genetic makeup of humans. This is not science fiction:\n\n\u201cBy delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [experimental] monkeys, the scientists are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019The sky\u2019s the limit,\u2019 said Michael Farzan, an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the new study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first human trial based on this strategy \u2014 called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer, or I.G.T. \u2014 is underway, and several new ones are planned.\u201d [That was three years ago.]\n\n\u201cI.G.T. is altogether different from traditional vaccination. It is instead a form of gene therapy. Scientists isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain diseases and then synthesize artificial versions. The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle.\u201d\n\nHere is the punchline:\n\n\u201cThe viruses invade human cells with their DNA payloads, and the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient\u2019s own DNA. If all goes well, the new genes instruct the cells to begin manufacturing powerful antibodies.\u201d\n\nRead that again: \u201cthe synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient\u2019s own DNA.\u201d\n\nNot just a \u201cvisit.\u201d Permanent residence. And once a person\u2019s DNA is changed, he will live with that change\u2014and all the ripple effects in his genetic makeup\u2014for the rest of his life.\n\nThe Times article taps Dr. David Baltimore for an opinion:\n\n\u201cStill, Dr. Baltimore says that he envisions that some people might be leery of a vaccination strategy that means altering their own DNA, even if it prevents a potentially fatal disease.\u201d\n\nYes, some people might be leery. If they have two or three working brain cells.\n\nThis is genetic roulette with a loaded gun. Anyone and everyone on Earth injected with a DNA vaccine will undergo permanent and unknown genetic changes\u2026\n\nAnd the further implications are clear. Vaccines can be used as a cover for the injections of any and all genes, whose actual purpose is re-engineering humans in far-reaching ways.\n\nThe emergence of this Frankenstein technology is paralleled by a shrill push to mandate vaccines, across the board, for both children and adults. The pressure and propaganda are planet-wide.\n\nThe freedom and the right to refuse vaccines has always been vital. It is more vital than ever now.\n\nIt means the right to preserve your inherent DNA.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Altering Human Genetics Through Vaccination", "description": "The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has launched efforts to create a vaccine that would protect people from most flu strains, all at once, with a single shot.Over the years, I\u2019ve written many articles refuting claims that vaccines are safe and effective, but we\u2019ll put all that aside for the moment and", "url": "https://organicconsumers.org/altering-human-genetics-through-vaccination/", "site_name": "Organic Consumers", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/organicconsumers", "article:published_time": "2018-06-28T23:56:00+00:00", "image": "https://organicconsumers.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/vaccine_syringe_immunization_bottle_shot_1000x523.jpg", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "523", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["<a href=\"#\" target=\"oca-linked\">TITLE ERROR</a>\n", "https://worldmercuryproject.org"], "authors": ["OCA"], "publish_date": "2018-06-28T23:56:00+00:00"}
