Anyone who has come in close contact with someone who tests positive must spend 14 days in the quarantine camp, even if they are triple jabbed and test negative for COVID\n\nAccording to President Biden, \u201ca winter of death\u201d awaits anyone who rejects the experimental COVID jab which, by the way, has been consistently shown to do far more harm than good.\n\nA December 16, 2021, White House statement reads: \u201cFor the unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death. For themselves, their family and the hospital they\u2019ll soon overwhelm.\u201d That exact sentence was reiterated the next day by COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients during a virtual press conference.\n\nAs reported by MSN\u2019s Claire Goforth,1 the \u201cprediction\u201d didn\u2019t go over well with the public. \u201cMost people hate it. They feel it\u2019s callous and cruel,\u201d Goforth said, quoting a number of Twitter responses, including one from John D. Davidson:\n\nA Twitter user by the name Martyr Made noted, \u201cThe aggressive Us/Them language in this White House message is insane.\u201d2 Olivia Nuzzi, a Washington, D.C., reporter for New York Magazine tweeted, \u201cWho is this for? Unvaccinated Americans are not going to be persuaded by messaging like this.\u201d3\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Ronald Klain defended Biden saying \u201cwe have a duty to warn people what they are facing if unvaccinated.\u201d4 But from my perspective, the rub is that they continue to pretend that lies are truth and truth is lies. Everything is upside-down, and many are rejecting this \u201cwinter of woe\u201d message for the simple fact that they know the opposite is true.\n\nIf we are to go by actual science and data, the warning Biden issued should have gone out to the vaccinated, because everything points to the double and triple jabbed being at increased risk for infection, especially with the Omicron variant.\n\nOne reason for this is because the COVID jab reprograms your innate and adaptive immune systems, causing immune depletion.5 Data also show that the more heavily \u201cvaccinated\u201d a population is, the higher the case rate gets.6 And even this fails to account for the massive increase risk of dying from the jab or becoming permanently disabled, as many jabbed millions have already suffered.\n\nFormer WHO Adviser Tells Vaccinated to Quarantine Over Winter\n\nBack in August 2021, the U.K. Column interviewed professor Christian Perronne, a French infectious disease expert, long-time vaccine policy chief and former vice president of the World Health Organization\u2019s European Advisory Group, who issued the opposite \u2014 and likely far more accurate \u2014 warning:7\n\nNot surprisingly, despite impeccable credentials, Peronne has been censored and shunned for his contrarian views on COVID countermeasures, the COVID gene transfer shots in particular. During his interview, he didn\u2019t mince words, referring to the European COVID-19 policy as \u201ccompletely stupid.\u201d\n\nAre Prison Camps for the Unjabbed Next?\n\nAs predicted, we are rapidly approaching a time when the unvaccinated might be imprisoned for no other reason than their refusal of an experimental gene transfer injection. In early January 2021, a New York bill (A416) was introduced that would give the governor and his or her delegates the power to remove and/or indefinitely detain anyone suspected of being a threat to public health.\n\nDetainees would be kept in a \u201cmedical facility or other appropriate facility\u201d \u2014 in other words, a medical prison camp \u2014 for a maximum of 60 days, although a court could extend the detention in 90-day increments, indefinitely. As reported by Reason:8\n\nThe bill comes up for a vote in the New York Senate and Assembly sometime in the next legislative session, which begins January 5, 2022.9 In addition to indefinite detention for poorly specified reasons, the bill would \u201crequire an individual who has been exposed to or infected by a contagious disease to complete an appropriate, prescribed course of treatment, preventive medication or vaccination.\u201d\n\nIn other words, this bill legalizes the forced vaccination of anyone who is detained under the mere suspicion of being infected with something or having been in close proximity to someone suspected of being infected. As reported by Rights and Freedoms:10\n\nAustralia Among the First to Test Medical Imprisonment Model\n\nIf you think being tossed into a prison camp without cause or recourse is impossible \u2014 after all, this is the United States of America, the land of the free, home of the brave \u2014 think again. Australia, another shining star of democracy, has backslidden into totalitarianism at a speed that has everyone\u2019s head spinning.\n\nThe Australian government has gone full speed ahead, building a massive COVID quarantine camp, complete with barbed wire fences, guards and video surveillance. Once you\u2019re in, you can\u2019t just waltz out whenever you want to. In the video above, Hayley Hodgson describes what it was like to be detained and transferred to a COVID internment camp, even though she wasn\u2019t sick.\n\nVideo surveillance placed her with a friend who had tested positive. They ran her license plate to retrieve her address and showed up at her house, telling her she had to quarantine. Even if you test negative, you still have to spend 14 days in a quarantine camp if you\u2019ve been in close contact with someone who has tested positive. If you refuse, you\u2019re fined $5,000 and forcibly taken there by police anyway.\n\nIf someone can threaten to extend your stay in this \u201chealth hotel,\u201d just what kind of medicine are we dealing with? Clearly, this is a prison model, not a health care model. When have you ever been in a hospital and the nurse tells you, \u201cIf you don\u2019t eat your pudding, we\u2019re keeping you here another three months\u201d?\n\nBased on Hodgson\u2019s description of the camp, you don\u2019t get much in terms of medical attention. One shudders to think what would happen to someone who actually had a severe case of COVID in there. Will hazmat suit-equipped police drop you at your room and then you don\u2019t see them again unless you\u2019re caught breaking some rule?\n\nFood is delivered and dropped outside your door once a day. Each room has a 2\u00d72 meter deck where you can go, but if you step outside your room or designated outdoor area without a mask, you\u2019re fined $5,000. She was also told that additional infractions would result in her stay being extended past the 14 days \u2014 even though she wasn\u2019t sick and there was no reason to keep her there in the first place.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally treated like a prisoner in there,\u201d she says. If you\u2019re triple jabbed and think that means you\u2019ll never see the inside of one of these prisons, think again. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve been double or triple jabbed.\n\nIf you\u2019re found to have been in close contact with someone who tests positive, in you go. And there\u2019s no legal process you can turn to for help if you disagree with the decree to quarantine. During her stay, three teenagers \u2014 all of whom had tested negative \u2014 managed to escape the camp. The manhunt that ensued is further evidence that we\u2019re dealing with a prison model and nothing else.\n\nUS Has Hundreds of Ready-Made Prison Camps\n\nWhile Australia is building its second camp, the U.S. already has 800 FEMA camps ready for action. As reported by AMG News:12\n\nThe article goes on to list the many executive orders that can work together to suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, effectively allowing government to seize control over all aspects of life, from food production and transportation to communications and health care functions.\n\nThere\u2019s even an executive order that allows the government to mobilize civilians into \u201cwork brigades\u201d to carry out whatever functions are deemed necessary, and one that allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate entire communities. To find the FEMA camp nearest you, check out the state listings in the AMG News article.13 Most states have three or more.\n\nInterpret the Media Narrative \u2014 They Want Civil War\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention over the past couple of years, you may have noticed that you can almost always predict what the next phase of the narrative is going to be. They \u201cadvertise\u201d or pave the way for the evolving narrative by putting out articles slanted in a given direction.\n\nBased on recent headlines, I suspect \u201cthe powers that be\u201d are hoping to incite a civil war. \u201cCIA Advisor: US Is \u2018Closer to Civil War\u2019 Than Thought Possible,\u201d the Daily Mail claims.14 \u201cWe\u2019re Edging Closer to Civil War,\u201d an opinion columnist at The New York Times declares.15 \u201cUS Closer to Civil War Than Most Would Like to Believe, New Book Says,\u201d announces The Guardian.16\n\nAccording to Dr. Barbara Walter, a political science professor who serves on the Political Instability Task Force, the U.S. meets several criteria that historically have served as indicators that an \u201copen insurgency\u201d may be imminent. In her book, \u201cHow Civil Wars Start,\u201d she writes:17\n\nGovernment Has Designated the Enemy, and It\u2019s Us\n\nThe problem here is that while authoritarian politicians keep paying lip service to \u201cdemocracy,\u201d their own actions are anything but. Just who is undermining democracy? If you believe the news and CIA advisers, it\u2019s the people who want the Constitution to stand and be adhered to that are the enemies of democracy. Never mind the mental gymnastics required to get to that conclusion.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to predict a scenario in which authoritarian leaders, acting on a falsely constructed narrative that a civil war is imminent, might start rounding up \u201cdissidents.\u201d And that\u2019s in addition to the already existing, thinly veiled threat of tossing the unvaccinated into indefinite detention.\n\nI agree with Walter\u2019s assessment that we\u2019re in dangerous territory, but not for the same reasons as she suggests. I would also argue that just about every country is a powder keg ready to blow, and for the same reason \u2014 people are being tyrannized by their governments and by unelected health authorities that claim powers they do not legally have.\n\nTake England, for example. Entrepreneur and COVID blogger Steve Kirsch was recently notified that an anti-COVID restrictions campaign member had been detained for 28 days under the Mental Health Act for not wearing a mask to a dentist appointment.18 Normally, it\u2019s quite difficult to get a person sectioned under the Mental Health Act, but not anymore.\n\nRefusing to wear a mask apparently qualifies as an acute mental health disorder warranting a month-long stay in a psych ward.\n\nThe man, Charlie Cunningham, is reportedly being held at Littlemore Mental Hospital in Oxford, \u201cwhere he\u2019s being deprived of sleep under the pretext of being suicidal,\u201d according to the woman who contacted Kirsch. She added, \u201cHe\u2019s now going to be detained over Christmas and New Year \u2014 [he\u2019s] very upset as he feels he\u2019s been kidnapped and being held against his will \u2026\u201d\n\nWhile all the articles mentioned earlier that warn of civil war blame the decline in democracy on the Trump administration, the Trump administration can hardly be blamed for the civil rights abuses and power grabs that are occurring today. It\u2019s time to judge each tree by its fruit. That said, knowing that a civil war would serve the totalitarian takeover agenda, it would be wise to make sure our resistance remains a peaceful one.\n\nDr. Joseph Mercola is the founder of Mercola.com.
