It certainly seems like that\u2019s been his end goal ever since he started going on record about wanting to invent new vaccines as part of his push for population control.\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many skeptical consumers are now wondering if the SARS-CoV-2 virus is actually a \u201cblessing\u201d for Bill Gates and his cronies. There\u2019s even a clear paper trail connecting Gates to 2019 research that literally figured out a way to tattoo proof of vaccines onto children\u2019s skin \u2026 and no \u2013 this is not science fiction.\n\nSuspicion grows: Does Bill Gates, long hopeful that vaccines will help curb population growth, want global citizens to \u201cprove\u201d they get the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with invisible tattoo?\n\nThe coronavirus scare is the perfect vehicle for Gates to complete his depraved plan of vaccinating everyone on the planet.\n\nWe already have multiple examples of the billionaire publicly stating that he wants vaccines, along with family planning policies and other interventions, to slow population growth and reduce the global population by 10 to 15 percent over the coming decades. (Here\u2019s video proof, in his own words.)\n\nAnd while fact checker websites like Snopes insist that Gates is pouring billions of dollars into vaccines as a way to \u201cimprove\u201d people\u2019s lives rather than act as an \u201cagent of death,\u201d many are deeply suspicious about the man\u2019s true intentions \u2026 and deeply concerned about what kind of Big Brother dystopia his vision is marching us toward, especially now that he has the widespread fear of COVID-19 to take advantage of.\n\nIn 2019, a study was conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The researchers \u201ccodelivered\u201d near-infrared microparticle technology along with a vaccine into the skin of test animals. The near-infrared microparticles are invisible to the naked eye but can be seen with \u201cmodified smartphones.\u201d The researchers proudly assert this invisible vaccine tattoo can be used to create an \u201con-person vaccination record.\u201d\n\nThe study, titled \u201cBiocompatible near-infrared quantum dots delivered to the skin by microneedle patches record vaccination\u201d and published in Science Translational Medicine, was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nCan you imagine? Having to have your arm \u201cscanned\u201d by someone wielding a handheld device to prove you\u2019ve had a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine just so you can go back to work, get on a plane, or enter a building?\n\nIt\u2019s absolute insanity \u2013 and it\u2019s not even the only invasion of privacy officials are drooling over.\n\nImmunity passports? Try vaccine passports \u2013 citizens call foul as concerns grow about a conspiratorial bait and switch\n\nThroughout the insanity over the past few months, some experts have floated the idea of so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d as a way to safely re-open countries and get the economy going again. Also called \u201crisk-free certificates\u201d according to the World Health Organization (WHO), these immunity passports have serious ethical concerns.\n\nJust think about what that world would be like: a world where you are forced to carry papers (let alone have an invisible tattoo!) which allegedly \u201cprove\u201d you\u2019ve recovered from COVID-19 and now have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore \u201csafe\u201d to return to society.\n\nFortunately, even the WHO seems skeptical \u2013 at least for now. From their website: \u201cSome governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an \u2018immunity passport\u2019 or \u2018risk-free certificate\u2019 that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.\u201d\n\nThey go on to add, \u201cAs of 24 April 2020, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans. Laboratory tests that detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in people\u2026 need further validation to determine their accuracy and reliability.\u201d\n\nOf course, this brings up another major question:\n\nBy \u201cimmunity passport,\u201d do these government agencies actually mean \u201cvaccine certificates?\u201d In other words, is the real goal to normalize and implement forced mass vaccination, especially given the apparent unknown viability of antibody testing?\n\nThis gross violation of bodily autonomy and personal rights seems to be having its groundwork laid by officials. On April 15 2020, in an interview with CBS News, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted that a COVID-19 vaccine is the current \u201cend game\u201d and is the preferred way to achieve a so-called \u201cherd immunity\u201d (when a population is allegedly protected from a disease because a majority of people are immune to it).\n\nThe alternative to creating herd immunity \u201cartificially\u201d as Dr. Fauci says, would be the result of a large percentage of the population contracting SARS-CoV-2 and then recovering from it. Hence the advent of and WHO-supported studies called \u201cserosurveys\u201d which aim to detect antibodies to the novel coronavirus in people \u2026 and as we\u2019ve just learned, there are lots of unknowns surrounding this kind of data.\n\nSo, only time will tell if these mass \u201cinvestigations\u201d into our blood will be worthwhile, or even continue.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bill Gates Funds Tattoo Id to Track People | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) More and more people are worried about this \"tattoo ID\" plan of Bill Gates.
