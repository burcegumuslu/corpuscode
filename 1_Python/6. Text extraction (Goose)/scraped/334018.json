The technology it promotes has the potential to reduce humans to literal mental slaves \u2013 and I\u2019m 0% exaggerating here.\n\nUsing \u201cwearable technology\u201d, the WEF would like to see employers and governments monitor brainwave activity to \u201craise productivity\u201d and to \u201cfight crime\u201d. And there\u2019s already talk of using brain implants that could further decode \u201ccomplex thoughts\u201d.\n\nThe examples shown during that presentation are nothing less than chilling and, the fact that the WEF says that this is something we \u201cneed to embrace as a society\u201d is nothing less than insane.\n\nEvery time the WEF presents one of its insane plans, it addresses \u201cconcerns\u201d by stating that it should be regulated \u2026 knowing very well that doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nThe only option is to ban this now.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot_20230215_095557.png", "url": "https://vigilantcitizen.com/vc-videos/the-wef-wants-to-monitor-your-brainwaves-to-raise-productivity-and-to-fight-crime/", "title": "The WEF Wants to Monitor Your Brainwaves to \"Raise Productivity\" and to \"Fight Crime\" (VC Video) | The Vigilant Citizen", "description": "At the World Economic Forum's 2023 Davos Meeting, there was a presentation titled \"The Battle For Your Brain\".
