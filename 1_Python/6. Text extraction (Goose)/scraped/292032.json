Take Bill Gates as a case in point. Rather than admitting that humanity has woken up to the truth about the disastrous experimental Covid-19 jabs, Gates, who is not a doctor, is doubling down and taking it upon himself to vaccinate the world by stealth.\n\nAccording to the billionaire eugenicist, farm animals including cows, pigs and chickens have inadequate genetics. And the only way to \u201cfix\u201d those genetics is to \u201cvaccinate\u201d every farm animal in the world with new mRNA vaccines.\n\nGates, who was divorced by his wife due to his close relationship with deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, visited the University of Edinburgh\u2018s Langhill Farm to launch the school\u2019s Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security.\n\nRather than beating around the bush and obfuscating, as he used to do before the Covid pandemic, Gates appeared comfortable bragging about pumping mRNA vaccines into farm animals destined for dinner plates.\n\nGates is becoming increasingly arrogant and no longer feels any shame whatsoever about openly broadcasting his true intentions for the planet right in plain sight.\n\nUnless all animals, including food animals, are jabbed with Big Pharma\u2019s latest poisons, the food supply will remain \u201cdirty,\u201d in Gates\u2019 view. Only he and his globalist minions can \u201csanitize\u201d nature with new chemicals and DNA modification techniques \u2013 which they are also trying to do to humans.\n\n\u201cThe Gates Foundation is partnered with DFID on a great number of things, and among those are work we do together on livestock,\u201d Gates stated, referring to the United Kingdom-based Department for International Development.\n\n\u201cHelping animals survive, either by having vaccines or better genetics, helping them be more productive \u2013 it\u2019s making a big difference.\u201d\n\nAs he usually does, Gates started all this by playing God with the lives of other people, experimenting on the third world, which he views as his personal fiefdom.\n\nAccording to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., anyone who is prepared to allow Bill Gates to dictate world and US health policy should take a long, hard look at his record in Africa.\n\n\u201cPerhaps millions of children have died unnecessarily,\u201d according Kennedy Jr., who shared information from a peer-reviewed publication in a respected journal.\n\n\u201cAnyone defending Bill Gates & WHO needs to explain Morgensen et al 2017.\u201c\n\n\u201cThis is a peer-reviewed publication in a respected journal by leading scientists describing outcomes akin to genocide,\u201d said Kennedy Jr.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. also slammed Gates and his \u201cmessianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cVaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft\u2019s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control over global health policy\u2014the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism,\u201d Kennedy Jr. wrote.\n\n\u201cGates\u2019 obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.\u201d\n\nSince Gates views poor people as having less value than himself, they get to be the guinea pigs for all of his newfangled endeavors to change the entire world into his own image.\n\nThe question remains, though: are those eggs actually safe? Is that meat fit for human consumption? Or does it contain the very same mRNA modifications that occur in humans after getting injected for \u201cCovid?\u201d What will these injections do to the food that is produced and sold to the masses?\n\n\u201cWe will soon be eating DNA altered, sickened animals from the same mRNA jabs contributing to the \u2018Died Suddenly\u2019 pandemic,\u201d warned a Twitter account called \u201cDJ Freedom Rocket.\u201d \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong \u2026\u201d\n\nAnother account responded to this that, apparently, we already are eating \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d animal products, not to mention all the genetically modified (GMO) plant products that have been on the market and in the food supply for decades.\n\n\u201cAre you aware of reports that Pharma now is looking to inject mRNA into foods?\u201d this same account asked. \u201cInto fruits and veggies? Into animal feed? Into fake vaccines for farm animals. Malthusians intend to poison our food supply.\u201d\n\nAll of this has been many years in the making. Thirteen years ago, Gates met with other globalists including Warren Buffett, David Rockefeller, George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, Ted Turner, Oprah Winfrey, to conjure up a coordinated response to the \u201cproblem\u201d of population growth, which all of these figures see as a threat to the \u201chuman race\u201d \u2013 meaning themselves and their ill-gotten wealth and lavish lifestyles, which were built on the backs of the very people they are now attempting to exterminate.\n\nGates has acquired 270,000 acres of land throughout America, according to last year\u2019s edition of the Land Report 100, an annual survey of the nation\u2019s largest landowners. He has his eye on farming in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia as well.\n\nAnalysts are now connecting the dots on his agenda on the mass vaccination and gene-modification projects of livestock and his purchases of farmlands. Critics can\u2019t help but worry that the global elite\u2019s agenda of hijacking the food supply is slowly being carried out.\n\nIn January 2020, the Gates Foundation announced the creation of a non-profit entity called Gates Ag One, which aims to \u201cspeed up efforts to provide smallholder farmers in developing countries \u2026 with access to the affordable tools and innovations they need to sustainably improve crop productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change.\u201d\n\nThe launch came shortly before the failure of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), which was founded in 2006 by the businessman\u2019s foundation as well as the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n\u201cApart from the obvious financial return on his investment, why else would Gates be interested in genetically engineering livestock? While we don\u2019t know the inner workings of the minds of the globalists, we could consider a couple of theories which, ultimately, end with the same result \u2013 ownership, and control by a few self-appointed elites with Gates as their frontman,\u201d the Expose\u2018s Rhoda Wilson commented.\n\nOne possible goal of Gates in pushing the GM of farm animals is to decimate them and force people to eat lab-grown inorganic substitute foods in the future, essentially eliminating the people\u2019s freedom to choose.\n\nJacob Bruns, writing for Headline USA, explains, \u201cIn the view of the world\u2019s billionaires, religious and political \u2018obstacles\u2019 remain that might get in the way of their mass experimentation.\u201d And he couldn\u2019t be more right.\n\nIt\u2019s not coincidence that the globalist elite at the World Economic Forum are actively working to subvert religion and convince humanity that God is dead and Jesus is fake news.\n\nThey global elite, led by figures such as Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, are like cartoon villains at this point. Except that they\u2019re real and incredibly dangerous.\n\nHere at the People\u2019s Voice we are determined to continue publishing and broadcasting the news that the mainstream media does not dare to touch. But we can\u2019t do it alone. We need your help to spread the truth far and wide.
