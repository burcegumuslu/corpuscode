But Snopes\u2019 \u201cfact-checking\u201d looks more like playing defense for prominent Democrats like Hillary Clinton and it\u2019s political \u201cfact-checker\u201d describes herself as a liberal and has called Republicans \u201cregressive\u201d and afraid of \u201cfemale agency.\u201d\n\nSnopes\u2019 main political fact-checker is a writer named Kim Lacapria. Before writing for Snopes, Lacapria wrote for Inquisitr, a blog that \u2014 oddly enough \u2014 is known for publishing fake quotes and even downright hoaxes as much as anything else.\n\nWhile at Inquisitr, the future \u201cfact-checker\u201d consistently displayed clear partisanship.\n\nShe described herself as \u201copenly left-leaning\u201d and a liberal. She trashed the Tea Party as \u201cteahadists.\u201d She called Bill Clinton \u201cone of our greatest\u201d presidents. She claimed that conservatives only criticized Lena Dunham\u2019s comparison of voting to sex because they \u201cfear female agency.\u201d\n\nShe once wrote: \u201cLike many GOP ideas about the poor, the panic about using food stamps for alcohol, pornography or guns seems to have been cut from whole cloth\u2013or more likely, the ideas many have about the fantasy of poverty.\u201d (A simple fact-check would show that food stamp fraud does occur and costs taxpayers tens of millions.)\n\nLacapria even accused the Bush administration of being \u201cat least guilty of criminal negligience\u201d in the September 11 attacks. (The future \u201cfact-checker\u201d offered no evidence to support her accusation.)\n\nHer columns apparently failed to impress her readership, oftentimes failing to get more than 10-20 shares.\n\nAfter blogging the Inquisitr, Lacapria joined Snopes, where she regularly plays defense for her fellow liberals.\n\nShe wrote a \u201cfact check\u201d article about Jimmy Carter\u2019s unilateral ban of Iranian nationals from entering the country that looks more like an opinion column arguing against Donald Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban.\n\nSimilarly, Lacapria \u2014 in another \u201cfact check\u201d article \u2014 argued Hillary Clinton hadn\u2019t included Benghazi at all in her infamous \u201cwe didn\u2019t lose a single person in Libya\u201d gaffe. Lacapria claimed Clinton only meant to refer to the 2011 invasion of Libya (but not the 2012 Benghazi attack) butoffered little fact-based evidence to support her claim.\n\nAfter the Orlando terror attack, Lacapria claimed that just because Omar Mateen was a registered Democrat with an active voter registration status didn\u2019t mean he was actually a Democrat. Her \u201cfact check\u201d argued that he might \u201chave chosen a random political affiliation when he initially registered.\u201d\n\nLacapria even tried to contradict the former Facebook workers who admitted that Facebook regularly censors conservative news, dismissing the news as \u201crumors.\u201d\n\nIn that \u201cfact check\u201d article, Lacapria argued that \u201cFacebook Trending\u2019s blacklisting of \u2018junk topics\u2019 was not only not a scandalous development, but to be expected following the social network\u2019s crackdown on fake news sites.\u201d The opinion-heavy article was mockingly titled: The Algorithm Is Gonna Get You.\n\nLacapria again played defense for Clinton in a fact check article when she claimed: \u201cOutrage over an expensive Armani jacket worn by Hillary Clinton was peppered with inaccurate details.\u201d\n\nOne of the \u201cinaccurate details\u201d cited by Lacapria was that, \u201cThe cost of men\u2019s suits worn by fellow politicians didn\u2019t appear in the article for contrast.\u201d She also argued the speech Clinton gave while wearing the $12,495 jacket, which discussed \u201craising wages and reducing inequality,\u201d wasn\u2019t actually about income inequality.", "opengraph": {"title": "Fact-Checking Snopes: Website\u2019s Political \u2018Fact-Checker\u2019 Is Just A Failed Liberal Blogger", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2016-06-27-fact-checking-snopes-websites-political-fact-checker-is-just-a-failed-liberal-blogger.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "Popular myth-busting website Snopes\u00a0originally gained recognition for being the go-to site for disproving outlandish urban legends -such as the presence of\u00a0UFOs in Haiti\u00a0or the existence of\u00a0human-animal hybrids in the Amazon jungle.
