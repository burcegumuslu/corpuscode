The relative reduction in risk of Covid-19 symptoms amounts to a paltry nineteen percent. Even if we remove cases that occurred within seven days after vaccination (which should eliminate the majority of ones due to vaccine reactogenicity), the relative reduction in risk still amounts to only twenty-nine percent. This is a far cry from the FDA minimum standard of fifty percent efficacy \u2013and even farther from the ninety-five percent figure trumpeted by Pfizer.\n\nFor some reason, Pfizer\u2019s 31 December paper in the New England Journal of Medicine didn\u2019t get around to mentioning any of this.\n\nIn fairness, it should be pointed out that some of these cases of suspected Covid-19 may be due to some other pathogen. But Dr. Doshi asks a pointed question: why should that even matter? If \u201csuspected\u201d and \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases of Covid-19 follow a similar clinical course, then perhaps suspected + confirmed cases is a more meaningful clinical endpoint that just confirmed cases.\n\nDr. Doshi\u2019s article raised other concerns as well. Pfizer\u2019s covid vaccine is meant to be administered in two doses, twenty-one days apart. 371 patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis for \u201cimportant protocol deviations on or prior to 7 days after Dose 2.\u201d Of these, sixty were from the placebo arm of the trial, whereas 311 were from the treatment arm.\n\nWhy were five times as many patients excluded from the treatment arm? No one who is in a position to know is saying anything.\n\nIn addition, without access to the patient-level data, we can\u2019t know how much stock to put into even the primary endpoint of the trial \u2013 confirmed covid-19 cases. The primary event adjudication committee for the Pfizer vaccine trials consisted of three Pfizer employees. In other words, Pfizer is asking us to take Pfizer\u2019s word regarding the efficacy of its product. Given that company\u2019s previous track record, which includes a $2.3 billion fine to settle claims of illegal marketing of its wares, that is cold comfort.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "HOPE Or HYPE: Part 3: Can We Trust Pfizer to Police Itself?", "description": "A number of concerns have bene raised about the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus, to wit: No data that show the vaccine prevents hospitalizations, ICU cases, or deaths No data that show the vaccine prevents transmission of the disease No access to the patient-level data No data at all beyond \u2026", "url": "https://naturalnewsblogs.com/hope-or-hype-part-3-can-we-trust-pfizer-to-police-itself/", "site_name": "NaturalNewsBlogs", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthRanger", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2021-02-17T18:23:39+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-17T18:23:40+00:00", "updated_time": "2021-02-17T18:23:40+00:00", "image": "https://naturalnewsblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Baby-Vaccine.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://naturalnewsblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Baby-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "650", "image:height": "365"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://pfe-pfizercom-d8-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/2020-09/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol.pdf", "https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/04/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-we-need-more-details-and-the-raw-data/", "https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577", "https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history", "https://naturalnewsblogs.com/author/patrickhahn/", "https://naturalnewsblogs.com/author/patrickhahn/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-02-17T18:23:39+00:00"}
