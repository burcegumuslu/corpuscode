But the bumbling idiot in the White House, Joe Biden, responded unequivocally \u201cyes\u201d when asked earlier this year if the U.S. would come to Taiwan\u2019s aid if the island democracy fell under attack by Beijing.\n\n\u201cPelosi is a vocal supporter of Taiwan \u2014 and her trip to the island earlier this week made her the most senior US politician to visit Taiwan in a quarter of a century, which infuriated China,\u201d The Sun reported. \u201cDuring her trip the Speaker of the House of Representatives voiced America\u2019s support for Taiwan and seemed to have called Beijing\u2019s bluff after it hinted it might shoot down her plane.\u201d\n\nFollowing Pelosi\u2019s visit, China launched massive military exercises and now has essentially placed a naval blockade around Taiwan.\n\nAs for Mastro, earlier this year she estimated that the U.S. could lose a war with China in a week as the Pentagon struggled to get forces into position to aid Taiwan following a Chinese sneak attack that would no doubt target U.S. Navy aircraft carriers as well as troops in South Korea, Japan and on Guam.\n\nBut any attack by China on U.S. forces will surely draw a heavy response \u2014 perhaps from a coalition of nations aligned with the U.S. because they cannot afford to leave the world to the Communist Chinese.", "opengraph": {"title": "Expert says China convinced it must hit US in \u2018Pearl Harbor-like\u2019 quick strike before attacking Taiwan", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-08-11-china-convinced-must-hit-us-before-attacking-taiwan.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "A leading national security expert believes China has devised a shocking plan to take Taiwan by force that would first involve a massive strike against the United States in the vein of Japan\u2019s Dec. 7, 1941 surprise attack.
