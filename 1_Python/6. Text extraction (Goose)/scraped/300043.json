It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nSince we have started publishing this, others from Europe have also calculated the numbers and confirmed the totals.*\n\nHere is the summary data through November 12, 2022.\n\nTotal reactions for the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (code BNT162b2,Comirnaty) from Pfizer \u2013 23,210 deaths and 2,667,243 injuries to 12/11/2022:\n\nTotal reactions for the mRNA vaccine SPIKEVAX/mRNA-1273(CX-024414) from Moderna \u2013 12,703 deaths and 870,106 injuries to 12/11/2022:\n\nTotal reactions for the vaccine AZD1222/VAXZEVRIA (CHADOX1 NCOV-19) from Oxford/ Astra Zeneca \u2013 9,667deaths and 1,388,494 injuries to 12/11/2022:\n\nTotal reactions for the COVID-19 vaccine JANSSEN (AD26.COV2.S) from 3,234 deaths and 178,053 injuries to 12/11/2022:\n\nTotal reactions for the COVID-19 vaccine NUVAXOVID(NVX-COV2373) from 3 deaths and 3,987 injuries to 12/11/2022:\n\n*These totals are estimates based on reports submitted to EudraVigilance. Totals may be much higher based on percentage of adverse reactions that are reported. Some of these reports may also be reported to the individual country\u2019s adverse reaction databases, such as the U.S. VAERS database and the UK Yellow Card system. The fatalities are grouped by symptoms, and some fatalities may have resulted from multiple symptoms.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "48,817 DEAD and 5,107,883 Injured Following COVID-19 Vaccines in European Database of Adverse Reactions | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "Eudravigilance EU reporting system is recording over 5 million injuries and close to 50,000 dead due to the Covid vaccines up to Nov 12 2022.", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/48817-dead-and-5107883-injured-following-covid-19-vaccines-in-european-database-of-adverse-reactions/", "article:published_time": "2022-11-19T09:59:51+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-19T09:59:51+00:00"}, "tags": ["Eudravigilance until Nov 12 2022", "Brian Shilhavy Health Impact News", "COVID Vaccine Deaths", "Covid vaccine adverse events", "Pam Barker", "Europe Reloaded"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.adrreports.eu/en/index.html", "https://dap.ema.europa.eu/analytics/saw.dll?PortalPages&PortalPath=%2Fshared%2FPHV%20DAP%2F_portal%2FDAP&Action=Navigate&P0=1&P1=eq&P2=%22Line%20Listing%20Objects%22.%22Substance%20High%20Level%20Code%22&P3=1+40983312", "https://dap.ema.europa.eu/analytics/saw.dll?PortalPages&PortalPath=%2Fshared%2FPHV%20DAP%2F_portal%2FDAP&Action=Navigate&P0=1&P1=eq&P2=%22Line%20Listing%20Objects%22.%22Substance%20High%20Level%20Code%22&P3=1+42325700", "https://dap.ema.europa.eu/analytics/saw.dll?PortalPages&PortalPath=%2Fshared%2FPHV%20DAP%2F_portal%2FDAP&Action=Navigate&P0=1&P1=eq&P2=%22Line%20Listing%20Objects%22.%22Substance%20High%20Level%20Code%22&P3=1+40995439", "https://dap.ema.europa.eu/analyticsSOAP/saw.dll?PortalPages&PortalPath=%2Fshared%2FPHV%20DAP%2F_portal%2FDAP&Action=Navigate&P0=1&P1=eq&P2=%22Line%20Listing%20Objects%22.%22Substance%20High%20Level%20Code%22&P3=1+42287887", "http://www.adrreports.eu/en/background.html", "https://czwiki.cz/Lexikon/Pfizer", "https://czwiki.cz/Lexikon/Moderna_(firma)", "https://czwiki.cz/Lexikon/AZD1222", "https://czwiki.cz/Lexikon/Oxfordsk%c3%a1_univerzita", "https://czwiki.cz/Lexikon/AstraZeneca", "http://www.adrreports.eu/en/background.html", "https://vaccineimpact.com/2022/48817-dead-and-5107883-injured-following-covid-19-vaccines-in-european-database-of-adverse-reactions/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-11-19T09:59:51+00:00"}
