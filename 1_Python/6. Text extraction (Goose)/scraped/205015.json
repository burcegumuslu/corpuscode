The measures are set to be lifted just a little over a month before the country\u2019s presidential elections. French Prime Minister Jean Castex confirmed the move in a statement, citing a decline in infections.\n\n\u201cThe health situation is improving,\u201d Castex told TF1 television on Thursday. With the exception of transportation, French citizens will no longer be required to wear masks in order to gain entry to venues starting on March 14. The vaccine passport system will also be \u201csuspended\u201d with the exception of elderly care centers and nursing homes.\n\nSince August, proof of vaccination has been required for entry to gyms, coffee shops, cinemas and dozens of other venues across the nation. France\u2019s \u201cpass sanitaire\u201d was launched with the aim of coercing French citizens to get inoculated. \u201cYou\u2019ve understood \u2013 vaccination is not immediately obligatory for everyone, but we\u2019re going to extend the health pass to the maximum, in order to push a maximum of you to go and get vaccinated,\u201d French President Emmanual Macron said last August.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the vaccine passport system, France was rocked by intense protests for weeks. The French Interior Ministry estimated the crowd size at over 200,000 in Paris during the peak of the demonstrations. Macron and his government only doubled down from there, however, with the president vowing to ramp up heat on unvaccinated citizens as recently as January. \u201cI am not about pissing off the French people,\u201d Macron told French magazine Le Parisien in January. \u201cBut as for the non-vaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And we will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy.\u201d\n\nNow, with presidential elections just a month away, the Macron government is changing directions. In dropping its vaccine passport program, France joins Sweden, Ireland, the U.K. and a handful of other European nations who have done the same. Several of the most COVID-strict U.S. states and cities have also dropped mandates in recent weeks, including New York and California.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "France to 'Suspend' Vaccine Passport Program Just Before Elections", "description": "Starting March 14, France will suspend its \"vaccine passport\" program.
