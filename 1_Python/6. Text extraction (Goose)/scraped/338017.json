Other well-followed Syrian monitoring groups said there had been deaths.\n\nMany opposition sympathizers circulated images of the dying children on social media sites with suggestions the vaccine had been adulterated with cyanide, possibly by regime agents, to undermine confidence in the opposition.\n\nIdlib is one of the few strongholds of a Western-back rebel movement that has largely been eclipsed by the nihilist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) or al-Qaeda\u2019s Jabhat Al-Nusra in non-regime parts of Syria.\n\nMohammad Mowas, a Syrian doctor working in Turkey, said the reported symptoms were a gradual slowdown in the heart rate as the infants turned blue and were consistent with cyanide poisoning. \u201cThis looks like deliberate attempt to spike the vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nFears that the death toll could rise yet further circulated the exile medical community last night.\n\nEach bottle of the vaccine contains 40 doses and medics believe two bottles were suspect.\n\nCharity Save the Children said it was \u201cappalled and deeply saddened\u201d by the deaths.\n\nIt said in a statement: \u201cSave the Children is appalled and deeply saddened by the news of the deaths of a number of children and the hospitalisation of many more after receiving vaccinations for measles in northern Syria earlier today.\n\nSubsequent reports claimed that at least some of the children were given a muscle relaxer by mistake, which is what caused their deaths.\n\nFollow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nSign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news\n\nWe use Bitcoin Too !", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dozens of Children Died After Being Given \u2018Tainted\u2019 Measles Vaccine in Syria | We Are Change", "description": "As many as 36 children were reported to have died excruciating deaths last night after receiving tainted measles vaccines under a UN-sponsored program in the rebel-held north of Syria.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/dozens-children-died-given-tainted-measles-vaccine-syria/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaron.kesel.5", "article:published_time": "2016-10-26T01:26:46+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-02-20T19:57:08+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/456292370.jpg", "image:width": "472", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.watoday.com.au/world/sabotage-suspected-as-dozens-of-children-reported-dead-after-measles-vaccination-in-syria-20140917-10hzk4.html", "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/un-vaccine-mistake-killed-syrian-children-2014101192556950498.html", "http://www.watoday.com.au/world/sabotage-suspected-as-dozens-of-children-reported-dead-after-measles-vaccination-in-syria-20140917-10hzk4.html", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/17/syrian-children-die-contaminated-measles-vaccine", "http://www.newsweek.com/15-syria-children-dead-after-measles-vaccination-271525", "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/un-vaccine-mistake-killed-syrian-children-2014101192556950498.html", "http://www.globalresearch.ca/36-children-die-in-war-torn-syria-from-un-measles-vaccines-government-claims-vaccines-were-intentionally-sabotaged/5504943", "https://wearechange.org/", "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChange.org/photos/a.484908358689.288182.86518833689/10154253557858690/?type=3&theater", "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChange.org/", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjznarRluDMAhWGsh4KHZR9DycQFgg7MAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Flukewearechange&usg=AFQjCNGZ722fTg-1DmJl3Ib2aHfT1CSi1w&sig2=6RA0-O-7X9WZHLjdYvqfhg", "https://instagram.com/lukewearechange", "https://www.patreon.com/WeAreChange?ty=h", "https://www.patreon.com/WeAreChange?ty=h", "https://steemit.com/steemit/@lukewearechange/i-want-to-make-a-video-about-steem-for-my-383-941-yt-subscribers-help-me-make-it-great"], "authors": ["Aaron Kesel"], "publish_date": "2016-10-26T01:26:46+00:00"}
