Charlie Baker\u2019s vax mandate:\n\nA Massachusetts police union said on Friday that dozens of state troopers have resigned over a COVID vaccine mandate for state workers.\n\nThe mandate requires state workers to get the vaccine shot by October 17 or may face termination from their jobs.\n\nA lawsuit was filed by The State Police Association of Massachusetts \u2013 a union that represents 1,800 officers \u2013 in an attempt to delay the mandate enforced by Republican Governor Charlie Baker. That suit was thrown out Thursday.\n\n\u201cMany of these troopers are going to be returning to their previous municipal police departments within the state that allow for regular testing and masks,\u201d union president Michael Cherven noted. \u201cTo date, dozens of troopers have already submitted their resignation paperwork.\u201d\n\nWhat is angering is that not long ago police officers, nurses, teachers, paramedics and other frontline workers (including truck drivers) were being hailed as heroes as they carried out their duties without a vaccine being available \u2014 and without anyone seeing them as some sort of societal threat.\n\nNot anymore, which again shows you just how politicized the left has made this virus and the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThroughout COVID, we have been on the front lines protecting the citizens of Massachusetts and beyond,\u201d SPAM chief Cherven added.\n\n\u201cSimply put, all we are asking for are the same basic accommodations that countless other departments have provided to their first responders, and to treat a COVID related illness as a line of duty injury,\u201d he added.\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb US President Donald Trump 24k Gold Plated Eagle Commemorative 2020 Campaign Coin \u2013 Re-Election Gift, Show Your Support to Keep America Great\n\nHowever, Judge Jackie Cowin of the Massachusetts Supreme Court denied the request last week.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the public interest is, unquestionably, best served by stopping the spread of the virus, in order to protect people from becoming ill, ensure adequate supply of medical services, and curtail the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the virus,\u201d Cowin told the Daily Wire.\n\nOnly, the vaccine isn\u2019t doing that; there have been an increasing number of so-called \u2018breakthrough infections\u2019 in people who have been vaccinated. So what is the point of getting one? And remember when we were being told life would \u2018get back to normal\u2019 with the availability of the vaccine?\n\nHow come COVID has become a vaccine mandate throughout society but flu vaccines haven\u2019t, though flu kills children and is a seasonal death threat?\n\nBut it\u2019s not just police officers we\u2019re losing; nurses and teachers have lined up to refuse the vaccine as well.\n\nAlso: The Supreme Court In The US Has Ruled That The Covid Pathogen Is Not A Vaccine, Is Unsafe, And Must Be Avoided At All Costs-Supreme Court has canceled universal vax\n\nMore than 100 staff members at Houston Methodist Hospital who were fired for refusing to get vaccinated for COVID-19 appealed a judge\u2019s ruling that sided with the hospital\u2019s right to terminate their employment.\n\n\u201cWe are going to most likely go all the way up to the Supreme Court,\u201d Jennifer Bridges, a registered nurse and the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was enjoined by 117 former employees of the hospital.\n\nAnd in New York City, as many as 28,000 public school teachers and employees risk losing their jobs if they don\u2019t take the jab by an Oct. 1 deadline.\n\nSo much for the left\u2019s chant, \u2018My body, my choice!\u2019 What hypocrites.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Millions Of First Responders, Police, Teachers, Healthcare Workers Will Soon Be Out Of A Job Over COVID Vaccine Mandates - American Media Group", "description": "Millions Of First Responders, Police, Teachers, Healthcare Workers Will Soon Be Out Of A Job Over COVID Vaccine Mandates", "url": "https://amg-news.com/millions-of-first-responders-police-teachers-healthcare-workers-will-soon-be-out-of-a-job-over-covid-vaccine-mandates/", "site_name": "American Media Group", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/medeea23greere", "article:published_time": "2021-10-05T19:01:22+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-05T21:00:08+00:00", "image": "https://amg-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/000-2.jpg", "image:width": "872", "image:height": "539", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Vaccine Mandates", "COVID-19"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://d1fdcdnbm9kuhr96tbxbn5yi3b.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG5octMILIONS", "https://d1fdcdnbm9kuhr96tbxbn5yi3b.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG5octMILIONSv", "https://8cb14hfcqdjsboalxg0fxk7z1y.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG5octMILIONS", "https://3869f8hchbj18w7comjb515ken.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG5octMILIONS", "https://amg-news.com/archives/13856", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022"], "authors": ["Medeea Greere"], "publish_date": "2021-10-05T19:01:22+00:00"}
