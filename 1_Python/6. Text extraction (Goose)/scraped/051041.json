But they need to get their vaccinations\u2026and their families will be alerted as to the dates.\u201d\n\nThe Office of The State Superintendent of Education for the District of Columbia recently announced that \u201call students must have up-to-date immunization certification on file with the school within the first 20 school days or they will not be allowed to attend school or school activities until the immunization certification is secured by the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the student does not come into compliance within a 20-school day period, the school must remove the student from school until the immunization certification is secured by the school,\u201d the office added.\n\nThe vaccine mandate will likely affect the education of black students as 47% of black children aged 12-15 in DC have not received the primary vaccination needed to attend school, according to government data.\n\nAnd 42% of black kids aged 16 and 17 are not vaccinated.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/muriel-bowser-vpas.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://osse.dc.gov/page/district-columbia-immunization-attendance-policy", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/08/25/dc-mayor-says-no-virtual-learning-giving-unvaccinated-black-teens-zero-alternative-options/", "https://coronavirus.dc.gov/data/vaccination", "https://reclaimthenet.org/subscribe"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
