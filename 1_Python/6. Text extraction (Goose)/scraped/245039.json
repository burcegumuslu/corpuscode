And, if you\u2019re one of them, you probably have some questions about what potential side effects you could experience after getting your third dose.\n\nNow, a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) breaks down exactly what you might go through (or not) after having a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The study analyzed self-reported data from the CDC\u2019s V-Safe vaccine safety reporting program of 22,191 people who received their third shots between August 12 and September 19, 2021.\n\nOf the 22,191 who made reports to V-Safe, about 7,000 (32%) said they noticed any side effects. More than 6,200 (28%) reported they didn't feel well enough to do normal daily activities, usually the day after they were vaccinated.\n\nThe side effects\u2014when people had them\u2014were generally mild, and the researchers found that there were \u201cno unexpected patterns of adverse reactions\u201d after people received their third dose. Here\u2019s what you need to know about COVID-19 booster shot side effects.\n\nFirst, who qualifies for a COVID-19 booster shot?\n\nThe CDC says that people in the following groups who got the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are now (or soon) able to get a COVID-19 booster shot:\n\u2022 People who completed their initial vaccine series at least six months ago\n\u2022 People who are 65 and older\n\u2022 People who are at least 18 and have underlying medical conditions\n\u2022 People who are at least 18 and work in high-risk settings\n\u2022 People who are at least 18 and live in high-risk settings\n\nWhat are the COVID-19 booster shot side effects?\n\nOverall, the CDC study found that 79.4% and 74.1% had local (meaning, at the spot where they got the shot) or systemic (all over) reactions, respectively, after their third dose. Worth noting: 77.6% and 76.5% reported local or systemic reactions after the second dose\u2014so these numbers are comparable.\n\nThe exact side effects people experienced, when they actually had side effects, included:\n\nSome reported having general pain, with 7% describing it as severe, which the CDC defined as pain that makes \"daily activities difficult or impossible.\" \n\n\n\n\u201cThe COVID vaccines have proven to be very safe and have been given to hundreds of millions of people,\u201d says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cIt is not surprising that a third dose does not have any concerning safety signal.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, what they\u2019ve shown is that, with the third dose, people shouldn\u2019t expect anything much worse than they had with the second dose,\u201d says John Sellick, D.O. an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the University at Buffalo/SUNY.\n\nWilliam Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says he\u2019s been telling patients that their side effects \u201cwill likely be very similar to what they experienced with the second dose of the vaccine.\u201d But, he says, \u201c[it's] not one for one. Some people may notice a little more side effects; Some will have less.\u201d\n\nHow can you prepare for your COVID-19 booster shot?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t feel physically amazing after your second COVID-19 dose, it\u2019s understandable if you want to be mentally and physically prepared for your third. If this describes you, experts recommend planning to take it easy the day after your vaccine. \u201cSome individuals might not want to schedule too much the next day until they see how they fare,\u201d Dr. Adalja says.\n\nDr. Schaffner agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve been telling patients not to plan anything terribly strenuous for the next day, just in case they feel fatigued,\u201d he says. With that, Dr. Schaffner says, it\u2019s reasonable to \u201cthink about a day ahead\u201d and plan on having the things you\u2019d need for meals and fluids handy, just in case you\u2019re not feeling well enough to leave your place the day after having your vaccine.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the possibility of missing work or school, Dr. Sellick recommends trying to schedule your booster on or just before a day you have off, just to be safe. Still, he says, \u201cmost people will feel just fine after having the vaccine.\u201d", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "Qualify for a COVID-19 Booster Shot? 3 Potential Side Effects You Could Experience", "description": "The good news is, the reported side effects so far are pretty minor!
