Case in point: here is physician Danielle Teller writing over at Quartz to suggest that teaching science as a collection of facts, rather than a process, has contributed to a lack of \u201cscience savvy.\u201d Yet in the same article she denounces the public\u2019s doubts on evolution \u2014 as if Darwinian theory were one \u201cfact\u201d that they ought to have simply swallowed whole.\n\nDr. Teller laments that \u201c[a]bout a third of Americans think there is no sound evidence for the existence of evolution.\u201d She wrongly lumps doubt over the scientific accuracy of evolution with vaccine and climate skepticism, and she is certainly mistaken in dismissing questions about Darwinian theory as a sign of scientific illiteracy. However, Teller is correct in describing science as a process of inquiry rather than the mere gathering of data.\n\nOne reason science should be taught as a process, Teller says, is because facts change. Or rather, the body of facts we know expands. This is well recognized. Indeed, one of the precursors to modern national science standards, Project 2061, focused on scientific inquiry rather than facts. Developed in the 1980s, it aimed to prepare a scientifically knowledgeable population in time for the return of Halley\u2019s comet in 2061. The project\u2019s director, Jo Ellen Roseman, told Ars Technica: \u201cWhile we had no idea what the world would be like, we could guarantee that it would be shaped by science, mathematics, and technology.\u201d\n\nBut macroevolutionary theory has run into trouble precisely because it is a 19th-century idea in a world where the body of known facts has broadened dramatically. Consider Darwin\u2019s explanation of the evolution of the eye. He thought that one could go from a light-sensitive spot to our complex human eyes. But that was understandable. In his era, no one recognized the eye\u2019s intricacies as we do now. Or take the case of so-called vestigial organs. To cite two examples, much of what we thought we knew about the appendix and tonsils as \u201cvestigial\u201d by-products of evolution has been falsified as scientists find important immune and other functions.\n\nYet neo-Darwinism\u2019s defenders hang on because humans have a tendency to reject ideas that challenge preconceived notions. As Thomas Kuhn wrote in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, when faced with an anomaly, a theory\u2019s defenders \u201cwill devise numerous articulations and ad hoc modifications of their theory in order to eliminate any apparent conflict.\u201d\n\nThe result in the context of origins science is a sort of \u201cfundamentalist\u201d evolutionary thinking that rejects counterevidence and dismisses any suggestion that evolution might have weaknesses. Teller writes of her own experience in learning to follow the evidence instead of what she had been taught, noting, \u201cmy own personal coda is that I never rejected out-of-hand a theory that challenged my preconceived notions again.\u201d Why the exception, then, for neo-Darwinism?\n\nScience, finally, should be taught as a process because the interpretation of data requires critical thinking. Science education theorists agree. In a joint issue on the theme of reform in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education, Nature and Scientific American noted, \u201c[S]tudents gain a much deeper understanding of science when they actively grapple with questions than when they passively listen to answers.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, in public school science classrooms, evolution is often presented in a one-sided, dogmatic manner. At Discovery Institute, we support education that promotes critical thinking by teaching the evolution controversy. What would that look like in the classroom? Teachers could engage their biology students on such questions as: Do Gal\u00e1pagos finches provide evidence for macro-, or only micro-evolution? Are vertebrate embryos really similar in their earliest stages? How likely is it that the Miller-Urey experiment represents conditions present on early earth? Such analysis makes students confront the data before them and look at it from multiple angles, considering a variety of possible interpretations. That, after all, is what the scientific method is all about.\n\nIn fact, you don\u2019t have to be a student, a teacher, or a scientist to engage in scientific inquiry. Thinking critically is for adults, all adults, too. Teller notes:\n\nIt\u2019s not possible for everyone \u2014 or anyone \u2014 to be sufficiently well trained in science to analyze data from multiple fields and come up with sound, independent interpretations. I spent decades in medical research, but I will never understand particle physics, and I\u2019ve forgotten almost everything I ever learned about inorganic chemistry. It is possible, however, to learn enough about the powers and limitations of the scientific method to intelligently determine which claims made by scientists are likely to be true and which deserve skepticism. [Emphasis added.]\n\nYes, exactly! It is possible. Although Teller goes on to echo the media\u2019s normal neo-Darwinian rhetoric \u2014 extol inquiry, but affirm the validity of dogmatic belief in evolution \u2014 what she says there could not be more right.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/mt-import/Inquiry-Based%20Science%20Education.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Inquiry-Based Science Education \u2014 on Everything but Evolution | Evolution News", "description": "Case in point: here is physician Danielle Teller writing over at Quartz.", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2016/01/inquiry-based_s/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2016-01-22T03:11+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2016-01-22T03:11+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2016-01-22T03:11+00:00"}, "tags": ["Views", "Science"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://qz.com/588126/theres-a-good-reason-americans-are-horrible-at-science/", "http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/the-us-is-still-learning-how-to-teach-kids-about-science/", "https://evolutionnews.org/2012/06/the_useless_app_1060521.html", "file:///C:/Users/schaffee/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/2PZMJ8B4/Problem%2010:%20Neo-Darwinism's%20Long%20History%20of%20Inaccurate%20Predictions%20about%20Junk%20Organs%20and%20Junk%20DNA", "https://evolutionnews.org/2015/09/unanswered_ques099081.html", "http://www.nature.com/news/the-scientist-of-the-future-1.17965", "http://www.discovery.org/a/3164", "https://evolutionnews.org/2012/09/back_to_school_064601.html", "https://evolutionnews.org/2015/02/problem_8_diffe091171.html", "http://www.discovery.org/a/24041"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016-01-22T03:11+00:00"}
