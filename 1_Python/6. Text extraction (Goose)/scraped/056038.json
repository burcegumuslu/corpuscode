It\u2019s not my lady\u2019s fault, it\u2019s my own. Until I got sick, I had the energy and determination to do all, be all. Now though, getting the girls ready for school is such a chore, I could go to bed for the remainder of the day. Instead, I spend 3 hours on transit to get them to school, come home, and choose to either clean, eat, or nap in the 1 to 1.5 hours I have before I have to spend another 3 to 4 hours trying to get back to the school to get them and bring them home. \u00a9 Nicholas Cobb / Quora\n\nI took 5 months of parental leave for my firstborn when she was 14 months old. The single hardest thing to adjust to was having no breaks. Never. To illustrate this a little better: In the last month, I spent one day a week at the office to help with re-transitioning into my old role and get back up to speed. Those were my days of vacation! All of a sudden, I had adult conversations. When I needed a break, I would pour myself a cup of coffee and just flip through a magazine. There\u2019d be other people, but they\u2019d never yell into my ear when they needed something from me. In fact, there was surprisingly little that people needed from me that was more than my thoughts on certain topics. When I\u2019d tell people, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that,\u201d they\u2019d accept it. When I told them something would be done by \u201cnext week,\u201d they\u2019d be okay with it. When I wanted to think something through, I\u2019d go to another room and just stare at the whiteboard and my notes for an hour. I would go to the bathroom by myself.
