Sigoloff\u2019s declaration is included in the 140-page appendix to the motion.\n\nSigoloff is one of several of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit who requested exemptions for medical reasons. Some of the reasons plaintiffs listed included pregnancy or being part of high-risk \u201cspecial populations.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, originally known as Doe et al. v. Austin, was filed by 18 members of the military, against the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nIn the latest motion, filed last month, plaintiffs also challenged:\n\u2022 The existence and/or availability in the U.S. of the Comirnaty vaccine.\n\u2022 The issuance of vaccine cards stating service members were vaccinated with \u201cComirnaty.\u201d\n\u2022 Claims that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine authorized for emergency use is \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with Pfizer\u2019s fully licensed Comirnaty vaccine.\n\nSigoloff ordered not to discuss COVID or vaccines\n\nIn his declaration, Sigoloff outlined the timeline of events leading to his being \u201cplaced in summary suspension,\u201d which bars him from seeing patients.\n\nHe said the main reason he was suspended was \u201cdue to the fact I was \u2018going against Secretary of Defense \u2026 guidance.\u2019\u201d\n\nSigoloff also was \u201cordered not to discuss COVID19 virus or vaccine [sic] in uniform and during the duty day, [an] infringement on my first amendment rights.\u201d\n\u2022 On Sept. 9, 2021, he was alerted by one of his patients that there was a problem with his medical exemption, based on a determination by the clinic\u2019s Commander LTC Marie Carmona, that all exemptions granted by Sigoloff were \u201cnow considered invalid.\u201d\n\u2022 He was told he \u201cmust notify all patients that the medical exemptions are no longer valid.\u201d According to Sigoloff, this is \u201cshadow policy\u201d that represents \u201ca significant deviation from the normal process,\u201d but he stated he nevertheless complied.\n\u2022 On Sept. 10, 2021, Carmona \u201cbanned the off-label use of ivermectin,\u201d a decision also characterized by Sigoloff as \u201cshadow policy.\u201d\n\u2022 On Sept. 13, 2021, Sigoloff \u201cwas placed in summary suspension by LTC Carmona for alleged: unprofessional conduct, dissemination of misleading information to patients and distribution of vaccine exemption letters characterizing vaccines as \u2018genetic therapy.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022 The following day, the Secretary of Defense published an official policy on medical exemptions. Sigoloff claimed \u201c[e]verything I provided for patients followed this policy which mirrors the policy from AR40-562. I was removed from patient care for going against the shadow policy.\u201d\n\u2022 On Sept. 16, 2021, Carmona published \u201can order that is in direct conflict with [Secretary of Defense] official policy and AR40-562,\u201d thereby putting into writing the shadow policy.\n\u2022 The next day, LTC Noberto Rodriguez \u201csent an email \u2026 which notified all healthcare providers of the now established shadow policy \u2026\u201d\n\nAn investigation followed, which resulted in a \u201cflag\u201d on Sigoloff\u2019s record based on \u201cfindings of: conduct unbecoming an officer, failure to obey lawful orders, and unprofessional comments that undermine the medical command when notifying patients that their medical exemptions are now invalid.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations made by Carmona following the investigation included, according to Sigoloff, that he not see patients younger than 17 for six months, and that he submit to \u201c100% medical chart audits and have patient encounters with supervision for six months.\u201d\n\nSigoloff was \u201cremoved from the position of Medical Director,\u201d and he was prohibited, by way of an order from Carmona, from discussing, making recommendations for, or caring for COVID-related patients or topics for one year.\n\nCarmona further ordered that if any of Sigoloff\u2019s patients \u201chave COVID-related questions \u2026 they are to be referred to another provider with an appropriate patient handoff.\u201d\n\nSigoloff was \u201creported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) after 30 days of suspension.\u201d\n\nA subsequent report from the NPDB \u201cgenerated a complaint\u201d against Sigoloff\u2019s Texas medical license. According to Sigoloff, he is now under investigation by the Texas Medical Board as a result.\n\nA General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand was placed in Sigoloff\u2019s permanent human resources record on Jan. 31, 2022.\n\nIn his statement, Sigoloff noted the flag on his record was removed, and that this is \u201cevidence that the \u2026 investigation could not adequately substantiate any of the claims against me when I refuted them.\u201d\n\nSigoloff said, \u201cI have had my practice of medicine investigated by an Army physician and his findings demonstrate the investigator\u2019s gross negligence or willful defamation of my character.\u201d\n\nPrior to the military\u2019s investigation of him, Sigoloff submitted a request for his own medical exemption from the military\u2019s COVID vaccine mandate, which prompted a required counseling session.\n\nCarmona told him she would not approve his request, which officially was denied by COL Vu Nguyen, with whom Sigoloff had not established a patient-physician relationship.\n\nSigoloff on Sept. 22, 2021 submitted a request for a religious exemption. The military did not respond.\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2021, a positive COVID test led him to request a permanent medical exemption on the basis of prior immunity. This request was initially rejected, according to Sigoloff, and is now pending appeal.\n\nFinally, Sigoloff\u2019s claims extend to the controversy regarding the alleged \u201cinterchangeability\u201d of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Comirnaty vaccines.\n\nAccording to Sigoloff, he informed Rodriguez on Sept. 14, 2021, that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is \u201cnot FDA-approved and not the same as Comirnaty.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Rodriguez gave him a memorandum stating that the two vaccines are \u201cinterchangeable,\u201d while the next day, Sigoloff said he was \u201cgiven an order to take Comirnaty\u201d but that \u201c[t]here was no Comirnaty available that day.\u201d\n\nSigoloff provided dozens of documents supporting his claims about the disciplinary procedure he faced.\n\nIn the plaintiffs\u2019 new motion, they argue the federal government has \u201cnot cited any agency rule, decision or practice supporting Defendants\u2019 unprecedented Interchangeability determinations,\u201d adding that \u201cComirnaty appears to [be] the first instance\u201d and that no relevant court precedent exists.\n\n\u201cThe DOD and Armed Services treat EUA vaccines \u2018as if\u2019 they were legally interchangeable with licensed Comirnaty, and they cite this determination as the legal basis for mandating that Plaintiffs accept a vaccine they have a statutory right to refuse and for punishing them for non-compliance.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs have alleged that the Armed Services have interpreted the FDA\u2019s Interchangeability determination as meaning \u201clegal interchangeability\u201d \u2026 and to require all EUA vaccines to be treated as if they are licensed, without regard to BLA-compliance.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, the Armed Services acted without statutory authority, as only the FDA has the authority to make such determinations or implement the PHSA [Public Health Service Act].\u201d\n\n\u201cBLA\u201d refers to Biologics License Applications, an FDA procedure which allows for the fast-track approval of certain medications and which is covered under Section 112 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, titled \u201cExpediting Study and Approval of Fast Track Drugs.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/samuel-sigoloff-military-doctor-exemptions-covid-vaccine-mandate/?itm_term=home", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://dockets.justia.com/docket/florida/flndce/3:2021cv01211/409961", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/68-PL-opposition-to-Def-MTD-2.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/68-1-Declarations-to-PL-Opposition-to-Def-MTD.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/military-members-seek-new-injunction-against-covid-vaccine-mandates/", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/military-members-seek-new-injunction-against-covid-vaccine-mandates/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/childrens-health-defense-sues-fda-pfizer-comirnaty-covid-vaccine/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/preventive-ivermectin-reduced-covid-mortality/", "https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/analysis-fda-s-covid-19-accelerated-pathways", "https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/biologics-license-applications-bla-process-cber", "https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/selected-amendments-fdc-act/food-and-drug-administration-modernization-act-fdama-1997", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/samuel-sigoloff-military-doctor-exemptions-covid-vaccine-mandate/?itm_term=home"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 21, 2022"}
