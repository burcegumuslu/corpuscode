Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The Defender is committed to providing a space for scientific debate. This piece is a rebuttal to this article regarding an open letter Geert Vanden Bossche, Ph.D., DVM wrote to the World Health Organization.\n\nOn March 6, an open letter by Geert Vanden Bossche, Ph.D., DVM, and a video interview of him by Phillip McMillan, MD, from a company called Vejon Health, were posted online.\n\nOn the surface, Vanden Bossche appears to perhaps be addressing credible concerns about COVID.\n\nHe\u2019s saying that the current crop of COVID vaccines will cause the novel coronavirus to mutate into a \u201csuper-infectious virus.\u201d And therefore he\u2019s calling for an immediate halt of the use of the current vaccines.\n\nIf humans are \u201ccommitted to perpetuating our species, we have no choice but to eradicate these highly infectious viral variants\u201d via \u201clarge vaccination campaigns,\u201d Vanden Bossche claims at the conclusion of his open letter. However, he continues, in contrast to the currently used COVID vaccines, these new vaccines must focus on stimulation of mass production of the component of the immune system known as natural killer cells, he asserts.\n\nBut Vanden Bossche bases his views on unproven hypotheses. This is similar to, and builds on, high-profile modeling-paper authors who use theoretical frameworks to inflame fears about the supposed dangerousness of the new variants.\n\nDespite this, Vanden Bossche\u2019s views were very quickly and positively received by high-profile vaccine sceptics such as Del Bigtree in his March 11 episode (starting at 57:25) and Vernon Coleman in his March 13 video and article.\n\nBigtree and Coleman virtually unquestioningly accept and amplify Vanden Bossche\u2019s views. They strongly insinuate to their overwhelmingly credulous subscribers that there\u2019s virtually no fact-checking or pause for sober second thought required.\n\nBut from my experience as a former long-time medical writer and journalist (1988-2016) \u2014 particularly a four-month stint with media-relations giant FleishmanHillard in 1994 (yes, I\u2019ve worked for the dark side) \u2014 this has all the hallmarks of a drug-company astroturf campaign. It\u2019s another step in the decades-long erasure of the fact that our sophisticated and highly effective immune systems work well and don\u2019t need any assistance from the biomedical/pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThere\u2019s abundant evidence that Vanden Bossche has a not-so-hidden agenda. For example, just before the three-minute mark in the video interview of Vanden Bossche by McMillan, Vanden Bossche indicates he\u2019s a long-time vaccine developer. He adds he\u2019s now focusing on vaccines that \u201ceducate the immune system in ways that are to some extent more efficient than we do right now with our conventional vaccines.\u201d Clearly he\u2019s got significant conflicts of interest. Therefore he has zero credibility when it comes to advising the public or anyone else about how to avoid negative effects of mass vaccination.\n\nHowever, Bigtree, Coleman and others don\u2019t point out any of the red flags. Despite taking Vanden Bossche\u2019s assertions extremely seriously, these high-profile alternative-media figures don\u2019t even do basic due diligence such as looking into McMillan, who\u2019s the man who interviewed Vanden Bossche, or the company McMillan is apparently affiliated with, Vejon Health. Bigtree, for example, relies heavily on the McMillan interview for the content of his March 11 segment.\n\nAs far as I know, McMillan and Vanden Bosch aren\u2019t among the thousands of M.D.s, Ph.D.s, and other people with graduate degrees or equivalent qualifications who have thoroughly debunked the official COVID narrative over the last 12 months. Rather, the pair suddenly popped out of the woodwork.\n\nAlso, McMillan isn\u2019t anything close to an expert on vaccines. On his website he describes himself as a \u201cdementia authority.\u201d The most recently published paper of his that I can find is from 2016 and is on Alzheimer\u2019s in the journal Medical Hypotheses. (In that paper, he and his co-author propose nutritional supplementation to lower the body\u2019s burden of aluminum, a high level of which is linked to Alzheimer\u2019s.) In addition, when one clicks on Vejonhealth.com one gets a message indicating the website isn\u2019t in use. Indeed, Vejon appears to be a dormant company.\n\nSo I ignored McMillan\u2019s interview and Vanden Bossche\u2019s open letter when I first learned about them last week. But then on March 12, I was contacted by the producer of something called the Gary Null Show on the Progressive Radio Network. The producer, Richard Gale, asked me to be a guest. I agreed to do the interview on March 15.\n\u2022 None This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nAbout 1.5 hours before the interview was to start, I contacted Gale and asked what the interview would focus on. Gale told me Null wanted to discuss Bigtree\u2019s segment on the Vanden Bossche letter and Gale sent me a link to it. So I quickly read the open letter and watched the full interview and Bigtree segment on it. A field of red flags popped up in my mind.\n\nAt the appointed interview start time of 12:30 p.m. on March 15, Null proceeded to read live to air, for about 12 minutes, some key points from the open letter. He told the audience to take them seriously. Then Null put me on the air. But he wouldn\u2019t let me talk about the letter. Instead, he repeatedly interrupted my efforts to do so and he insisted I only discuss the new variants. So I hung up. And I\u2019ve been edited out of the archived broadcast of Null\u2019s show.\n\nI\u2019m going to be interviewed live today (March 16) starting at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time by Ryan Cristi\u00e1n of The Last American Vagabond. We\u2019ll talk about the Vanden Bossche letter and McMillan interview. Apparently Ryan\u2019s on the same page as me.\n\nMeanwhile, my tweets about the open letter and the Null interview have gotten a lot of reaction. And, as it happens, since Sunday people have been emailing to encourage me to read Vanden Bossche\u2019s letter and watch his interview. Many are swayed by his calling for an immediate halt of the use of the current crop of COVID vaccines and by the fact that people like Bigtree are propagating his messages.\n\nSo I decided to write this article to expose a few of the dozens of clues showing that this curious case is a continuation of the overall COVID deception.\n\nHere are some more of those clues:\n\u2022 In his March 11 segment, Bigtree shows a slide with Vanden Bossche\u2019s background. It indicates he\u2019s affiliated with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and other vaccine proponents. Del dubs Vanden Bossche a \u201cworld-renowned vaccine creator.\u201d Coleman calls him \u201ca very eminent vaccine specialist.\u201d\n\nBut, when combined with the contents of his open letter, it\u2019s impossible to believe that he\u2019s in fact an insider who\u2019s now turned against his very high-powered comrades. (More on this below.) It\u2019s more likely that he\u2019s their accomplice.\n\nAnother indication that the letter is designed to propagandize rather than to let objective evidence speak for itself is the wording Vanden Bossche uses. He writes, for example, that he was \u201cracing against the clock\u201d to write \u201cthis agonizing letter\u201d in which he \u201cput[s] all of my reputation and credibility at stake\u201d to help \u201cturn the tide\u201d against this \u201cirrepressible monster\u201d that the virus could soon become unless we heed Vanden Bossche.\n\u2022 In his open letter Vanden Bossche also writes, \u201cI can assure you that each of the current vaccines have been designed, developed and manufactured by brilliant and competent scientists.\u201d However, he doesn\u2019t say a word about the massive adverse-event rate and very scant efficacy profile of the vaccines that were created by these \u201cbrilliant scientists.\u201d\n\u2022 Vanden Bossche also asserts that there\u2019s an \u201cever[-]increasing threat from rapidly spreading, highly infectious variants.\u201d But as I detailed in my Feb. 3 article and accompanying video on the new variants, there is no proof that they are highly infectious or will be any time soon.\n\u2022 There is the possibility of viral resistance, as for example I note in my March 9, 2021, article and accompanying video. But it\u2019s not the major threat Vanden Bossche attempts to scare us about by saying the virus is likely to mutate so much and so quickly because of the current mass vaccination campaigns that soon it could escape all current attempts to stop its spread. Remember, for example, that yearly flu mass vaccination hasn\u2019t caused influenza to spiral out of control and decimate the global population.\n\u2022 Vanden Bossche also writes that some antibodies are made by the innate immune system, but that these \u2018natural\u2019 antibodies are non-specific. He also states that they have \u201csuboptimal\u201d \u201cmaturity, and are \u201crather limited and only short-lived.\u201d He claims they are a very weak link in our immune reactions to pathogens such as the novel coronavirus: \u201cthe combination of viral infection on a background of suboptimal Ab [antibody] maturity and concentration enables the [novel corona] virus to select mutations [, thereby] allowing it to escape the immune pressure.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is on very shaky ground. Because, among other things: 1) Neither in the original March 6 piece nor his March 13 follow-up does Vanden Bossche provide any direct, non-theoretical evidence that this is happening; 2) The \u2018natural antibodies\u2019 that are produced after encountering a pathogen are only a small part of a quick, effective and broad-based first-line immune-system defense \u2014 known as \u2018innate\u2019 or \u2018passive\u2019 immunity \u2014 which in fact largely comprises other components; and 3) Vanden Bossche downplays the effectiveness of the antibodies our bodies naturally produce as part of the second-line (\u2018adaptive\u2019) part of the immune system that also has served us extremely well for millennia.\n\nA March 11 commentary by Michael Yeadon and Marc Girardot has similar information to my points 3, 4 and 5. However the pair present it in a way that\u2019s very pro-mRNA-vaccine and pro- much of the official-COVID-narrative \u2014 neither of which I endorse.\n\u2022 Vanden Bossche also has no references in that original document. He does include some in his follow-up, March 13, document posted on his website. But that March 13 document, like the March 6 one, hasn\u2019t been posted on the website of a journal, never mind a peer-reviewed one, nor reviewed in any more serious a manner. And in an unusual approach, he doesn\u2019t attach each reference to a particular statement in his document; rather, he lists the references at the end of the article under categories such as \u2018Natural antibodies.\u2019\n\u2022 Vanden Bossche drives at the need for \u201clarge vaccination campaigns.\u201d These, he writes, should be for \u201cNK [natural-killer]-cell\u2013based vaccines\u201d that \u201cwill primarily enable our natural immunity to be better prepared \u2026 and to induce herd immunity.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not very logical to believe that the only solution to the theoretical possibility of immune escape, as espoused by someone who\u2019s got a long and strong focus on vaccination as opposed to other ways to improve health, is yet more mass vaccination.\n\nNot to mention that the concept of herd immunity is contrived. After all, if your immune system is protecting you against a pathogen, it doesn\u2019t matter whether someone else\u2019s is or not.\n\nI do agree that we should stop the use of the current vaccines. But we also need to stop production and use of antivirals and antibodies and all other parts of the COVID-industrial complex.\n\nCOVID has an extremely high survival rate. So why develop yet another expensive, invasive and experimental solution to a problem that barely exists, if it does at all?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rebuttal: The \u2018Not-So-Hidden Agenda\u2019 Behind Bossche\u2019s Concern Over COVID Mass Vaccination", "description": "In her rebuttal to Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche\u2019s open letter to the WHO, Rosemary Frei, MSc, outlines what she says are \u201ca few of the dozens of clues\u201d suggesting that Bossche\u2019s argument \u201cis a continuation of the overall COVID deception.\u201d", "url": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rebuttal-rosemary-frei-bossche-vaccination-concern/", "site_name": "Children's Health Defense", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHealthDefense/", "article:modified_time": "2021-03-17T17:39:41+00:00", "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Bossche-not-so-hidden-agenda-feature.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "834", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/about-us/sign-up/?utm_source=top_of_article&utm_medium=the_defender&utm_campaign=sign_ups", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/virologist-huge-price-covid-mass-vaccination/", "https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/virologist-huge-price-covid-mass-vaccination/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://www.rosemaryfrei.ca/the-modelling-paper-mafiosi/", "https://thehighwire.com/videos/vaccine-disaster-ahead/", "https://vernoncoleman.org/videos/covid-19-vaccines-are-weapons-mass-destruction-and-could-wipe-out-human-race", "https://prospect.org/health/pharma-backed-astroturf-group-drug-prices/", "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astroturfing", "https://drphilipmcmillan.com/about/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142155/", "http://www.vejonhealth.com/", "https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11190028", "https://prn.fm/", "https://prn.fm/gary-null-show-03-15-21/", "https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/category/interviews/", "https://twitter.com/RosemaryFreiTO/status/1371510774137520129", "https://twitter.com/RosemaryFreiTO/status/1371513004664233994", "https://thehighwire.com/videos/vaccine-disaster-ahead/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/vaccines/gates-pushes-gene-altering-technology-on-seven-billion-humans/", "https://www.who.int/workforcealliance/members_partners/member_list/gavi/en/", "https://be.linkedin.com/in/geertvandenbossche", "https://vernoncoleman.org/videos/covid-19-vaccines-are-weapons-mass-destruction-and-could-wipe-out-human-race", "https://www.rosemaryfrei.ca/laying-out-the-evidence/", "https://www.rosemaryfrei.ca/no-safety-data/", "https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/", "https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/", "https://www.healthline.com/health/acquired-immunity#what-is-it", "https://www.pandata.org/how-broad-is-covid-immunity/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/editorial/an-mrna-vaccine-against-sars-cov-2-preliminary-report-a-researcher-reacts/", "https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/", "https://www.rosemaryfrei.ca/the-curious-case-of-geert-vanden-bossche/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
