VAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe data included a total of 19,249 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 396 over the previous week \u2014 and 143,395 reports of serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period \u2014 up 4,269 compared with the previous week.\n\nExcluding \u201cforeign reports\u201d to VAERS, 664,745 adverse events, including 8,898 deaths and 56,297 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and Nov. 19, 2021.\n\nForeign reports are reports received by U.S. manufacturers from their foreign subsidiaries. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product\u2019s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 8,898 U.S. deaths reported as of Nov. 19, 20% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 26% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 56% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 447.7 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of Nov. 19. This includes: 260 million doses of Pfizer, 171 million doses of Moderna and 16 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Historically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Nov. 19, 2021 for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\u2022 2,093 total adverse events, including 22 rated as serious and 1 reported death that occurred in an 11-year-old girl from Georgia vaccinated Sept. 14, prior to the authorization of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine in the 5 to 11 age group.\n\u2022 1,103 adverse events have been reported in the 5 to 11 age group since Nov. 1.\n\u2022 The rest of the reports in VAERS for children in the 5 to 11 age group occurred prior to the authorization of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine, and are due to \u201dproduct administered to patient of inappropriate age.\u201d\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Nov. 19, 2021 for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 23,484 total adverse events, including 1,439 rated as serious and 31 reported deaths.\n\nThe most recent death involves a 16-year-old girl from Georgia (VAERS I.D. 1865389) who died reportedly from a heart condition and multi-organ failure two days after receiving Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\nOther recent deaths include a 16-year-old girl from Missouri (VAERS I.D. 1823671) who died after receiving her second dose of Pfizer, and a 17-year-old female from Washington (VAERS I.D. 1828901) who died Oct. 29 reportedly from a heart condition after receiving her second dose of Pfizer.\n\u2022 59 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death \u2014 with 96% of cases\n\n attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 560 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) with 549 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 139 reports of blood clotting disorders, with all cases attributed to Pfizer.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Nov. 12, 2021, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 19% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 42% were female and the remaining death reports did not include gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 72.7.\n\u2022 As of Nov. 19, 4,424 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1,390 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 3,197 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 41% to Moderna and 8% to J&J.\n\u2022 760 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), with 41% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 30% to Moderna and 28% to J&J.\n\u2022 2,149 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.\n\u2022 11,209 reports of blood clotting disorders. Of those, 4,960 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 4,000 reports to Moderna and 2,195 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 3,209 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 1,999 cases attributed to Pfizer, 1,067 cases to Moderna and 133 cases to J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\nMan with natural immunity forced to get vaccinated against COVID to remain on lung transplant list, dies after second dose of Moderna\n\nBobby Bolin, a 49-year-old Texas man who previously had COVID, was told he would have to get vaccinated against COVID in order to be eligible for a double-lung transplant, even though he had already recovered from the virus.\n\nAfter his second Moderna shot, received on April 17, Bolin developed a pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation \u2014 a heart condition characterized by an irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, chest pain and extreme fatigue. His health rapidly deteriorated and he passed away Aug. 20, before receiving new lungs.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Defender, his wife, Amy Bolin, said there was no reason her husband should have been forced to get the vaccine in order to receive new lungs, but unfortunately, he was desperate and very sick.\n\nAmy said she didn\u2019t know what timeline her husband had with his organs, but she saw a complete change in him over four months\u2019 time and doesn\u2019t want others to face the same things they experienced.\n\nIn an analysis presented during a meeting of the American Heart Association, Dr. Steven Gundry, a pioneer in infant heart transplant surgery, said mRNA COVID vaccines put many patients at higher risk of a new acute coronary syndrome, such as a heart attack.\n\nThe analysis concluded in part that mRNA vaccines \u201cdramatically increase inflammation on the endothelium and T cell infiltration of cardiac muscle and may account for the observations of increased thrombosis, cardiomyopathy and other vascular events following vaccination.\u201d\n\nThousands of heart-related injuries have been reported following COVID mRNA vaccines, and scientists have established a myriad of heart- and blood-related effects in some patients, including young people.\n\nAmong the adverse events linked to the vaccines are thrombosis blood clots and heart inflammation known as myocarditis and pericarditis.\n\nShares of major COVID vaccine makers surged amid the latest pandemic fears surrounding the new Omicron variant, CNN Business reported.\n\nModerna climbed more than 20% during Black Friday\u2019s short trading session on Wall Street and increased by an additional 10% on Monday.\n\nShares of BioNTech, which partners with Pfizer to produce COVID vaccines, soared 14% on Friday and were up 3% Monday, as Pfizer gained 6% Friday.\n\nInvestors are hoping the vaccine makers will be able to quickly update their COVID vaccines to offer protection for the Omicron variant.\n\nModerna said Friday it \u201cwill rapidly advance an Omicron-specific booster candidate\u201d while Pfizer said it hoped to have an update of its vaccine ready in 100 days if Omicron shows resistance to its current vaccine.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in an interview Tuesday current COVID vaccines will likely be much less effective against the new Omicron variant, compared with previous variants, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know how much, because we need to wait for the data,\u201d Bancel said. \u201cBut all the scientists I\u2019ve talked to \u2026 are, like, \u2018This is not going to be good.\u2019\u201d\n\nBancel said scientists did not expect such a highly mutative variant to emerge for another year or two, noting 32 of the 50 mutations in Omicron involve the spike protein \u2014 the area targeted by existing COVID vaccines.\n\nIn early March, Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche, a vaccinologist who worked with GSK Biologicals, Novartis Vaccines, Solvay Biologicals, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s Global Health Discovery team in Seattle and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization in Geneva, broke down the dangers of mass vaccination for COVID compared to natural infection and concluded:\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that continued mass vaccination campaigns will enable new, more infectious viral variants to become increasingly dominant and ultimately result in a dramatic incline in new cases despite enhanced vaccine coverage rates. There can be no doubt either that this situation will soon lead to complete resistance of circulating variants to the current vaccines.\u201d\n\nAs The Defender reported March 26, a combination of lockdowns and extreme selection pressure on the virus induced by the intense global mass vaccination program, might diminish the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the short-term, but will ultimately induce the creation of more mutants of concern.\n\nThis is the result of what Vanden Bossche called \u201cimmune escape,\u201d which will in turn trigger vaccine companies to further refine vaccines that will add to, not reduce, the selection pressure, producing ever more transmissible and potentially deadly variants.\n\nVanden Bossche argued the selection pressure would cause greater convergence in SARS-CoV-2 mutations affecting the spike protein of the virus responsible for breaking through the mucosal surfaces of our airways \u2014 the route used by the virus to enter the human body \u2014 effectively outsmarting the highly specific antigen-based vaccines that are being used and tweaked, dependent on the circulating variants.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Omicron Variant Sends Vaccine Makers\u2019 Stocks Soaring, as VAERS Data Show 913,000 Reported Adverse Events After COVID Vaccines", "description": "Megan Redshaw - Among the adverse events linked to the vaccines are\u00a0thrombosis blood clots\u00a0and heart inflammation known as\u00a0myocarditis\u00a0and pericarditis.", "url": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/omicron-variant-sends-vaccine-makers-stocks-soaring-as-vaers-data-show-913000-reported-adverse-events-after-covid-vaccines/", "site_name": "Waking Times", "article:published_time": "2021-11-30T23:00:59+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-30T23:01:10+00:00", "image": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Covid-Vaccine-many.jpg", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">49-year-old Texas man who recovered from COVID\u2014but was required to be fully vaccinated against virus before being approved for a life-saving lung transplant\u2014died when he developed a pulmonary embolism and heart issues after his second Moderna vaccine.<a href=\"https://t.co/YHCwKb2lIp\">https://t.co/YHCwKb2lIp</a></p><p>\u2014 Robert F.
