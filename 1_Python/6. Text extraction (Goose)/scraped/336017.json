Bow before me, mere mortals!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve just seen this being done by the US President in order to give him power to do things like write the biggest check in US history to student debtors.\n\nHow can that be? Legislators, the President is taking the power of the purse away from the Senate and the House and claiming the authority to write a check of any amount to anyone he pleases! That\u2019s totally wrong!\n\nNot to mention Governors claiming the power to keep people in their homes, to force them to take medicines, to close down their businesses, and a host of other restrictions because of the COVID emergency.\n\nAnd my own fear?\n\nMy fear is that these jerkwagons will declare a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d that will authorize them to take any \u201cclimate\u201d action they want\u2014close down industries, ban cars, require heat pumps, the possibilities are endless.\n\nSo \u2026 how can we fix this badly broken system?\n\nHere are my proposals:\n\nFirst, we need to define what an emergency actually is. The dictionary definition is good:\n\nThis is a useful definition. For example, they\u2019ve been warning us about the impending climate Thermageddon\u2122 for fifty years. None of their warnings of catastrophe have come true.\n\nAnd for 50 years they\u2019ve been claiming that we need \u201cimmediate action\u201d, right away \u2026 and despite us basically doing zip, no climate calamities have happened.\n\nSo by definition, the situation with the climate is not an emergency. Not unexpected, doesn\u2019t require immediate action.\n\nIn any case, we need clear legislation at both the State and Federal level specifying things like:\n\u2022 Who can declare an emergency.\n\u2022 How long does the declaration last.\n\u2022 What emergency powers the government can legally take.\n\u2022 What emergency powers the government can not legally take.\n\nWith that as prologue, if I ran the circus I\u2019d make the rules like this.\n\u2022 Adopt the definition of \u201cemergency\u201d given above.\n\u2022 Only allow a State of Emergency to be declared by a vote of 2/3 of the Legislature. If you can\u2019t get 2/3 thirds of the Legislature to agree it\u2019s an emergency, it\u2019s not an emergency.\n\u2022 Any State of Emergency expires 14 days after it is voted in. It can be extended twice, but only for 14 days each time, by a new 2/3 vote of the Legislature. After that, pass regular laws in a regular manner.\n\u2022 No Legislator eligible to vote for the State of Emergency can be granted any emergency powers.\n\u2022 No Emergency Order can contravene either the State or Federal Constitution.\n\u2022 Members of the Executive Branch cannot use the State of Emergency to spend money without the approval of the Legislature.\n\u2022 All Emergency Orders expire when the State of Emergency expires.\n\nYes, I know that\u2019s just a rough first cut on what we need, subject to \u201ca hundred visions and revisions before the taking of a toast and tea\u201d \u2026 but it\u2019s clear that we need something like that.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t want someone from either political party empowered to say I can\u2019t leave my home for months on end based on some bogus Chicken Little claim that \u201cThe sky is falling! EVERYONE PANIC!\u201d.\n\nAnd the current system, where the same person declaring the emergency assumes extraordinary emergency powers with no specifications or limits, that\u2019s bull goose looney. Nothing good will come of that.\n\nRegards to all,", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "This Is An Emergency!", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2022/09/12/this-is-an-emergency/", "description": "Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach We\u2019ve just seen, up close and personal, the huge problems with the declaration of a State of Emergency by some potentate from City Mayor to US President.
