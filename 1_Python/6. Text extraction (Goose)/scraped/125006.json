This one comes from a paper published last year but presented at the Royal Astronomical Society last week. Shepard, Zharkov and Zharkova may have gotten us a step closer to understanding why the solar cycle varies in length from 8 to 14 years. Since the level of solar activity correlates with both the the length of the current solar cycle and the surface temperatures on Earth one solar cycle later (the notch-delay theory, and see the work of David Archibald), it may make it possible to predict the climate decades in advance. (With the caveat that this new study is still a model, correlation is not causation, etc.)\n\nOne of the better descriptions comes from Astronomy Now.\n\nThe Sun, like all stars, is a large nuclear fusion reactor that generates powerful magnetic fields, similar to a dynamo. The model developed by Zharkova\u2019s team suggests there are two dynamos at work in the Sun; one close to the surface and one deep within the convection zone. They found this dual dynamo system could explain aspects of the solar cycle with much greater accuracy than before \u2014 possibly leading to enhanced predictions of future solar behaviour. \u201cWe found magnetic wave components appearing in pairs; originating in two different layers in the Sun\u2019s interior. They both have a frequency of approximately 11 years, although this frequency is slightly different [for both] and they are offset in time,\u201d says Zharkova. The two magnetic waves either reinforce one another to produce high activity or cancel out to create lull periods.\n\nWith the Sun, we struggle for good data. Shepard et al only have three sunspot cycles of magnetic field data to go on but used the longer sunspot records as well.\n\nThe debate on this one is certainly not over. The new paper suggest there are two solar dynamos but in 2011 Nicola Scafetta argued that solar dynamics is best modeled with three interference circulation modes. His model reproduces past solar activity for millennia and also predicted a grand minimum by 2030.\n\nThe topic is a prediction publicized over the weekend that \u201cSolar activity predicted to fall 60% in 2030s, to \u2018mini ice age\u2019 levels\u201c. This is quite plausible, because it fits with several other predictions made in 2013 by a number of authors (Special Issue of Pattern Recognition in Physics, M\u00f6rner, Tattersall & Solheim, 2013).\n\nBe aware that \u201csolar activity\u201d refers to the number of sunspots, not the total energy output of the Sun \u2014 which is very near constant and has varied less than 0.15% over the last 400 years. It\u2019s not as if the Sun is going to be producing 60% less heat: it will produce almost exactly the same heat as it always does, just with far fewer sunspots.\n\nHowever, even this is very significant. Last year we blogged that the number of sunspots accurately predicts the small changes in temperature here on Earth, such as those associated with global warming, but with a delay of one sunspot cycle (which averages 11 years, but is only half the Sun\u2019s full cycle, which averages about 22 years).\n\nThere was a largish fall in solar activity in 2004 (in 11 year smoothed TSI), so there will be a significant and sustained fall in global temperature on Earth starting in about 2017 (the current sunspot cycle is a long one, about 13 years, 2004 + 13 = 2017). This will outweigh the warming effect of extra carbon dioxide.\n\nThe Earth has been in a warming trend for the past 350 years, since the depth of the Little Ice Age during the Maunder Minimum, in the second half of the 1600\u2019s. This warming trend appears to be driven by solar activity\u2014carbon dioxide didn\u2019t start increasing until 1800 or so, and didn\u2019t really get going until after WWII with post-war industrialization.\n\nSo the Shepard paper\u2019s prediction that the Sun is going inactive, and will lead to a cooler Earth such as last seen in the Maunder Minimum of the 1600s (when ice fairs on the Thames River in London were common), is plausible and likely.\n\nNote that the influence of sunspots on terrestrial temperatures is not because the heat of the Sun varies (that variation is pretty insignificant in terms of global warming or cooling). It is because something about the Sun, perhaps its UV output or a magnetic influence on the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, affects the cloud cover on Earth, and thus how much sunlight the Earth reflects back out to space. More clouds mean more sunlight is reflected without warming the Earth, so the Earth is cooler. If the Sun is affecting the cloud cover on Earth, it is affecting the Earth\u2019s temperature even though the heat from the Sun stays about constant.\n\nNote also that the delay of one sunspot cycle (averaging 11 years) mentioned above, between the change in solar activity and Earthly temperatures, is because there is a half-cycle delay between sunspots and \u201cforce X\u201d. Force X is the name we\u2019ve given to the solar influence on Earth\u2019s cloudiness\u2013the \u201cX\u201d is because we aren\u2019t sure what it is, like \u201cx-rays\u201d were so named because by their discoverer William R\u00f6ntgen because he didn\u2019t know what they really were. The Sun\u2019s full cycle is around 22 years \u2013 the sunspot \u201ccycle\u201d is only half of it, because the number of sunspots goes as the square of the magnetic field strength so the positive and negative phases of the 22-year cycle look the same in terms of sunspots. The sunspots merely signal where force X will be in about 11 year\u2019s time.\n\nThis is a bit like a four stroke combustion engine, which has four phases (suck, squeeze, bang, blow). If you know how much fuel and air is sucked in during the \u201csuck\u201d phase then you know how much power will be produced in the \u201cbang\u201d phase, which comes half a cycle (or two phases) later. Similarly with the Sun: the sunspots (or solar activity) tell us how much force X there will be half a full cycle (about 11 years) later.\n\nThe finding in the Shepard paper that the Sun has two dynamos is exciting for force X, making it quite plausible that the UV or magnetic effects that constitute force X are following the trends in bulk radiation produced by the dynamos.\n\nThe IPCC does not include any solar influence in the climate models except the direct heating by the Sun. But the total radiation from the Sun is almost constant \u2014 it is even known as the Solar Constant, because it wasn\u2019t found to vary until observed by satellites starting in 1979. So, along with Bloomberg, NASA, and the IPCC, we say that changes in solar activity will have only a negligible direct effect.\n\nThere are some major updates concerning the notch-delay theory, which we will be blogging on soon.\n\nWhat would be the impact on the climate?\n\nIf Shepard and Scafetta are correct about the upcoming dearth of solar activity by the 2030s, by 2040 it will have cooled significantly, by maybe 0.5C to 1.0C, undoing the global warming since 1800 or even 1700. That cooling could start as early as 2017. This cooling would be counteracted by a mild warming due to rising carbon dioxide, but the net effect would be cooling.\n\nThe ratio of La Ninas to El Ninos will presumably increase, making for slightly more floods and fewer droughts in eastern Australia.\n\nSimon J.
