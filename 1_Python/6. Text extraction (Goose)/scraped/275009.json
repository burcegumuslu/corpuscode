Australia\u2019s foreign ministry will also contact its counterpart in Norway on the issue.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech are working with the Norwegian regulator to investigate the deaths in Norway, Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. The agency found that \u201cthe number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations,\u201d Pfizer said.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that deaths have also been reported in other countries, but do not have full details of this yet,\u201d Norway\u2019s medicines agency said. \u201cThere are also differences between countries in who is prioritized for vaccination, and this could also affect the reporting of side effects, including death.\u201d \u201cThe Norwegian Medicines Agency has communicated, prior to the vaccination, that when vaccinating the oldest and sickest, it is expected that deaths will occur in a time-related context with vaccination. This does not mean that there is a causal link between vaccination and death. We have also, in connection with the reported deaths, conveyed that it is possible that common and known side effects of the vaccines may have been a contributing factor to a serious course or fatal outcome,\u201d the agency said.\n\nMeanwhile, nothing is as strong as \u201canecdotal\u201d evidence, and as such a video was released showing an American woman have some sort of seizure after taking the first dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nBrant Griner issued an appeal on Facebook, after his mother began experiencing serious medical issues several days after taking the vaccine.\n\nIn a now-viral post, Griner shared a video of his mother shaking uncontrollably as she attempted to walk, using nearby walls and a door to support herself as she inched forward. The video can be seen below:\n\n\u201cMom is getting even worse today and I still don\u2019t have any answers from doctors as to how to fix this. Please pray for her. I can\u2019t stand to see my mom this way. It makes me want to cry. knowing I can\u2019t do anything to help her. Please don\u2019t take the covid19 vaccine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not in any way shape or form an anti-vaxx person. My mom wasn\u2019t \u2013 she was all for the vaccine before this happened,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hospital determined that she was experiencing a \u201cneurological reaction,\u201d he said, adding that doctors believe the medical condition was caused by \u201cthe metals in the vaccine.\u201d\n\nSeparately, in Israel, at least 13 people in Israel appear to be suffering from facial paralysis after taking Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nPfizer and health authorities are investigating the case of a Florida doctor who died from an unusually severe blood disorder 16 days after receiving the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. It is not yet known if the shot is linked to the illness.\n\nPfizer said that so far the evidence doesn\u2019t suggest a connection. The Florida-based physician developed a rare disorder called severe thrombocytopenia that decreases the body\u2019s ability to clot blood and stop internal bleeding.\n\nPfizer said in its statement. \u201cIt is important to note that serious adverse events, including deaths that are unrelated to the vaccine, are unfortunately likely to occur at a similar rate as they would in the general population.\u201d\n\nUp until now, serious problems reported were 29 cases of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. None were reported as fatal. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache or fever, which are usually transient.\n\nPfizer generally refuses to acknowledge that any of these quite adverse effects such as death or neurological damage are due to its vaccine.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 Reading the Fine Print: The Undoing of the Australian Open", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "More And More Deaths Emerge From Pfizer Vacine 'Success Story'", "description": "In Norway, the government is concerned about the deaths of 29 elderly people who were subject to Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine....", "url": "https://southfront.org/more-and-more-deaths-emerge-from-pfizer-vacine-success-story/", "site_name": "South Front", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontEnTwo", "article:published_time": "2021-01-18T17:45:14+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-01-18T17:48:07+00:00", "image": "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1607939171-6398.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "464", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://southfront.org/donate/", "https://s4.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1607939171-6398.jpg", "https://s4.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-11.mp4", "https://www.sproutwired.com/at-least-13-people-in-israel-have-facial-paralysis-after-pfizer-vaccination/", "https://southfront.org/reading-the-covid-fine-print-the-undoing-of-the-australian-open/", "https://southfront.org/u-s-president-to-be-joe-biden-unveils-his-1-9-covid-19-relief-plan/", "https://southfront.org/donate/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-01-18T17:45:14+00:00"}
