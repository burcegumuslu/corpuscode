Symptoms last for up to a month and the disease is transmitted through skin to skin contact, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated items such as bedding and clothing.\n\nCOVID/Climate Merging: Modeling study claims: \u2018Climate Change Will Make Pandemics Like COVID More Likely\u2019\n\n\u201cClimate change is creating a new age of infectious dangers.\u201d Climate Change Could Spark Future Pandemics \u2013 \u201cThe research, published in Nature, uses modeling to map how climate change could shift the geographic ranges of 3,100 mammals species and the viruses they carry by 2070. \u2026 The findings suggest that climate change could \u201ceasily become the dominant [human] driver\u201d of cross-species virus transmission by 2070, the authors say.\u201d Marc Morano: \u201cThey want to keep both climate and COVID fears humming along to push their so-called solutions, so what better way than to merge the two issues!? Worried about COVID-19, then support the UN Paris climate pact, the Green New Deal, carbon taxes, etc. or else you are a gramma killer!\u201d Meanwhile, the data does not support this latest speculative computer model COVID/Climate scare story: See: H. Sterling Burnett\u2019s analysis: Science Crushes Claimed Link Between COVID & Climate\u2013 \u2018In reality, if a modestly warming Earth has any impact on viruses and pandemics, it is to make them less likely and less severe\u2026Historically, we know that the Black Plague arose and ran rampant in Europe and elsewhere during the Little Ice Age.\u2019 Bill Gates warns \u2018climate change\u2019 will cause more viruses like COVID-19 \u2013 Claims \u2018it\u2019s quite clear\u2019 it originated in bats Bill Gates: \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear in this case, [Covid] came across through animals. And almost all our diseases, like HIV, crossed over from chimpanzees in Africa quite some time ago; Ebola came from bats, this also, with one step in between came across from bats.\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo it\u2019s going to keep happening, particularly with climate change where we\u2019re invading a lot of habitats.
