Some articles about this issue.\n\nNano Particles Used In Untested H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccines \n\n By F. William Engdahl\n\n Global Research\n\n \n\n Vaccines which have been approved by the responsible government authorities for vaccination against the alleged H1N1 Influenza A Swine Flu have been found to contain nano particles . Vaccine makers have been experimenting with nanoparticles as a way to \u201cturbo charge\u201d vaccines for several years. Now it has come out that the vaccines approved for use in Germany and other European countries contain nanoparticles in a form that reportedly attacks healthy cells and can be deadly. :http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=15092\n\nNano chips in the tip of the needles? \n\n\n\nThe swine flu injection needles contain nano particles in their very tip, which cannot be detected with the naked eye but are clearly visible with as little as a 12 times magnifying microscope like children\u2019s toy microscopes . http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_data/health/vaccinations/news.php?q=1252603660\n\nAaron Russo interview with N.

It has been suggested that special government supplied needles are to be used because these will contain a nano chip. A bar code on the syringe package would allow traceability, for example.\n\n http://www.theflucase.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1698%3Aneed-for-special-needles-delays-vaccination-campaign-in-norway&catid=1%3Alatest-news&Itemid=64&lang=nl\n\nTake care and keep going strong!\n\n \n\n Jan from Holland", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://educate-yourself.org/vcd/swinefluvaccinemicrochips11nov09.shtml", "http://www.terrapinn.com/2009/flu/?gclid=CKrWrqaV950CFdQq3godAm-jqA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyH2jyUhNXY&feature=related", "../cn/http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=15092", "http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_data/health/vaccinations/news.php?q=1252603660", "http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1263677258215075609&hl=en", "http://www.awakentothetruth.com/vaccine_magic_conspiracy.htm", "http://www.theflucase.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1698%3Aneed-for-special-needles-delays-vaccination-campaign-in-norway&catid=1%3Alatest-news&Itemid=64&lang=nl"], "authors": ["By Doreen Miller", "Ken Adachi"], "publish_date": null}
