It is common to hear people remark that the 2001 anthrax attacks have been \u2018memory-holed\u2019 in the public consciousness, if that\u2019s the case then the Bush-era smallpox program is a memory-hole within a memory-hole. Starting with the early history of Smallpox, variolation and the very first vaccines, Robbie tells the story of how a disease that was eventually eradicated globally became a powerful fearmongering tool that shaped the Clinton, Bush and Covid-19 eras. After George W Bush got elected and the PNAC dream came true, of not just one but two \u2018catalyzing\u2019 events ( anthrax & 9/11 ), the idea of innoculating the entire American public via smallpox vaccination became one of the primary Bush policy postures simultaneously with the drive towards the Iraq war.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a 2 part episode. Part 2 will be released sometime in late December for Patreon subscribers only\n\nMedia Roots Radio subscribers now have access to a new set of documents\u2026..\n\nnote: @ 37:30 Robbie incorrectly refers to \u2018Our Hidden History\u2019 as Henry Hakam\u00e4ki\u2019s podcast, while Our Hidden History is also a great podcast this was a mistake, Henry Hakam\u00e4ki\u2019s podcast is actually called the Guerrilla History Pod which you can check out here: twitter.com/guerrilla_pod\n\nThanks for listening!
