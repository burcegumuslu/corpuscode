Since 2020, looting, theft and shoplifting has grown exponentially in cities run by Democrats like San Francisco, Chicago, Portland, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Most of which are bold and brazen acts committed in broad daylight. On the other side of the coin, you have George Soros spending millions to install progressive, soft-on-crime district attorneys in all these cites and many more across America. Is that a coincidence, or a plan? Hmm.\n\n\u201cDeliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\u201d Psalm 71:4 (KJB)\n\nCrime is up, prosecutions are down, and the thieves and looters know there will be little to no repercussion for their criminal behavior because people like George Soros are spending big to destroy this country. Not only is crime surging, but homelessness is on the rise with tent cities popping up in nearly every city run by Democrats. What is the Biden administration doing about it? Sending $200 billion to Ukraine with a promise that the money train will never stop. America as you know it is being systematically dismantled, and it seems that there isn\u2019t a Republican or Democrat in sight that can put a stop to it. This is what\u2019s left of America in 2023, not much.\n\nAs Walmart shuts down four stores in crime-ridden Dem-led Chicago, here\u2019s the list of all the big box shops \u2013 from Macy\u2019s to Target \u2013 which have closed due to millions in losses from rampant theft\n\nFROM THE DAILY MAIL UK: This week, Walmart announced it will shut down four of its stores in Chicago just weeks after America\u2019s biggest employer shuttered its only stores in Portland. It comes as shoplifting reaches alarming levels and other large retailers, including Target, Macy\u2019s and Best Buy, are now making good on threats to shutter outlets if petty crime was not lowered.\n\nIn 2021, retailers lost a combined $94.5 billion to shrink, a term used to describe theft and other types of inventory loss. And organized retail crime incidents soared by 26.5 per cent in the same year, according to the 2022 National Retail Security Survey.\n\nProgressive district attorneys in cities like Chicago, New York, Portland and California have also been blamed for effectively legalizing shoplifting with either not prosecuting thefts under $950, or letting criminals off with a slap on the wrist.\n\nWalmart decided to shut 17 of its stores across nine states after CEO Doug McMillon warned in December that theft was the highest it\u2019s ever been around the country and if it did not slow down, stores would have to close.\n\nAnd the company announced on Tuesday it would be shutting half its Chicago stores, mostly located on the crime-ridden city\u2019s south and west sides, because they are losing tens of millions each year.\n\nTarget revealed it lost an extraordinary $400million in profits last November due to organized gangs of shoplifters who had been stealing merchandise from its stores. And its CFO said the company expected retail thefts to reach $600 million by the end of the year.\n\nWalgreens has previously complained about retail shrinkage largely due to organized shop lifting last year and spent money on extra security measures including glass panels and security guards as preventative measures. High-profile incidents in San Francisco \u2013 where thieves were filmed walking out of stores with armfuls of stolen goods while security guards stood helpless \u2013 seemed emblematic of the issues facing the retailer.\n\nAnd there have indeed been a number of closures, with five alone in San Francisco in fall 2021. Walgreens closed a store in Chicago in January and three last month on Grand Avenue in Texas and South Orange Blossom Trail and South Orange Avenue in Florida.\n\nShopping mall staple Macy\u2019s is closing four stores in the first quarter of 2023, with malls in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Maryland losing out. The closures are part of Macy\u2019s three-year plan to close 125 locations as an increase in organized retail crimes cuts into the profits of businesses.\n\nIts CEO Jeff Gennette said it has experienced a rise in theft across its stores and that it was an \u2018industrywide trend\u2019.\n\nBest Buy CEO Corie Barry highlighted the growing problem with theft at its stores back in November 2021. The big box retailer sells very high value gadgets including computers, TVs and phones \u2013 many of which are smaller in size but high in value, making them prime targets for shoplifters.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond\u2019s troubles extend beyond shoplifting, with the ailing retailer set to close hundreds of stores as demand for its homewares evaporate. The retailer, which once owned more than 1,500 stores across America, has identified at least 416 of its US stores for closure.
