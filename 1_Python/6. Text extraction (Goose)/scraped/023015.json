Precautions for those who are still well are simply to wash your hands often with soap or sanitizer for \u201cat least 20 seconds.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn this age of hard-hitting news on the Internet that feeble mainstream sources will not report\u2014but with the potential for falsehoods, exaggerations and deliberately planted urban legends also present on the Internet\u2014it\u2019s no easy task to say with certainty just how hard county, state, U.S. and global H1N1/swine flu shot advocates will push to vaccinate the greater population in the coming weeks. Yet, the bottom line is that more and more people will not take the shot.\n\n\n\nConsidering the known dangers of adjuvants and other highly suspect ingredients in modern vaccines, refusing the shot itself and avoiding any kind of nasal vaccine in spray form seem to be the only sensible course\u2014no matter what plot is brewing. The best vaccination is no vaccination.\n\n\n\n \n\nNews reports appeared October 6 showing health care workers in Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee taking the nasal vaccine, FluMist, like willing sheep. Indeed, what is just as disturbing as government medical tyranny is the servility of Americans, particularly health care workers, to blindly accept the H1N1 nasal spray vaccine, amid troubling allegations that the spray\u2014which is heavy with live viruses\u2014could enable the viruses to incubate in the nasal tissue and then be released into the air by sneezing. This spreads the virus, possibly starting the very pandemic that thus far has not materialized, contrary to World Health Organization claims.\n\n\n\nNo matter what, Americans must refuse the H1N1 vaccine in needle and nasal form. But Americans must go beyond that and change every law in every state and at the national level that requires vaccinations.\n\n\n\nAmericans can force authorities at all levels and the profit-seeking drug companies that make these vaccinations to back down in a major way, and to \u201cclean house\u201d regarding any current or future attempts by megalomaniacs and mindless believers in all aspects of modern medicine to imperil the fabric of society with sordid medical schemes.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of good signs of much-needed resistance out there. New York healthcare workers held a morning rally at the state capitol in Albany September 29 \u201cto protest the new regulations mandating that all healthcare workers with patient contact receive all CDC \u2018recommended\u2019 flu vaccines\u2026 including the just licensed, un-safety-tested \u2018swine flu\u2019 2009 \u2018H1N1-A.\u2019\n\n\n\nMembers of [Ron Paul\u2019s] Campaign for Liberty are taking an active role in this rally,\u201d as noted in a news bulletin posted at HealthFreedomUSA.org.\n\n\n\nSo, in the short term we must greet \u201cthe shot\u201d and \u201cthe spray\u201d with bald-faced refusal and press on to expose the vast medical fraud that is our current system.\n\n\n\nRemember, the clamor for national healthcare is about giving Big Medicine even more money and covering only conventional medical treatments.\n\n\n\nCall and write your local and state health departments, local media and state representatives, contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control, and annoy your member of Congress and your U.S. senators about this H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d situation. Make it known that the vaccine is not needed and is unacceptable in any form under any pretense.\n\n\n\nMark Anderson is a longtime newsman now working as a corresponding editor for American Free Press.
