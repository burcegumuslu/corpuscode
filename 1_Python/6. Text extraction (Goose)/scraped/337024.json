The trillion dollar cancer industry \u2014 which claims that chemotherapy and radiation kill cancer cells, save lives, and boost long-term survival rates in terminally-ill cancer patients; OR people who fight and survive cancer \u2014 not because of chemotherapy-based cancer \u2018treatment\u2019, but because of cannabis oil-based therapy?\n\nWhy Should You Believe? While chemotherapy stimulates healthy cells to produce a protein that supports tumor growth and makes the tumor cells resistant to further cancer treatment, the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (TetraHydroCannabinol or THC) causes tumor cells to commit suicide while leaving healthy non-tumor cells unharmed.\n\nIn 1989, 55-year-old Stan Rutner \u2014 then retired dentist running a lucrative mini-storage business \u2014 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. After six months of aggressive and toxic standardized allopathic treatment, Stan was cured; he heaved a sigh of relief since his cancer was in remission. However, he was fighting cancer again in 2011; this time he was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer with metastasis to the brain.\n\nAfter telling him that \u201cStan was in deep shit\u201d, doctors began to \u2018treat\u2019 him with chemotherapy and radiation, gave him just weeks to live and ordered him to take refuge in a hospice; which he entered on August 12, 2011. Barb Rutner, Stan\u2019s wife, recalls:\n\n\u201cShortly after treatment began, Stan was riddled with weight loss and chronic nausea, debilitating fatigue and was wasting away. After that he was wiped out. He was very thin. So we finished radiation to his brain on June 25, and on July 13 he entered the hospital for the first time with radiation pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs due to radiation therapy). There were three hospital visits during that time, and on the third they kept him for a week and started him on oxygen 24/7. And then he went into palliative care.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to explore all alternative treatments possible to delay Stan\u2019s somewhat \u2018inevitable\u2019 death sentence, the Rutners tried Reiki energy treatments, acupuncture, and even creative visualization; yet nothing worked. That\u2019s when John Malanca, Stan and Barb\u2019s daughter, Corinne\u2019s soon to be husband, looked for cannabis as a possible treatment option to ease Stan\u2019s pain. Stan was dying and had nothing left to lose, so he was ready to give Cannabis a go.\n\nBarb explains what \u2018treatment\u2019 was meted out to Stan:\n\n\u201cCorinne and John were becoming interested in medicinal marijuana but we were concerned that Stan was wasting away. He had lost so much weight and so we were anxious to get his appetite improved and help him with the nausea. So Corinne suggested daytime cannabis capsule infused with coconut oil; they\u2019re yellow capsules that he started taking. He started taking those in early November of 2011 and in the beginning, he took about a third of a capsule in the morning, and it was about a week or two later that he was able to give up the extra oxygen that he had had 24/7.\u201d\n\nIn just a couple of weeks of starting cannabis, Stan witnessed an incredible turnaround. He gained weight, ditched his walker, dumped his 24/7 oxygen; began exercising, and started getting sound sleep. On January 27, 2013, Stan\u2019s brain MRI showed no evidence of recurrent disease: the stage 4 lung cancer, which had metastasized to his brain two years ago and almost taken his life, was gone. At 80, Stan\u2019s cancer is still in remission\u2026\n\nDave Mihalovic, a Naturopathic Doctor who specializes in vaccine research, cancer prevention and a holistic approach to cancer treatment, notes:\n\n\u201cNo chemotherapy drug has ever actually cured or resolved the underlying causes of cancer. Even what mainstream medicine considers \u201csuccessful\u201d chemotherapy treatments are only managing symptoms, usually at the cost of interfering with other precious physiological functions in patients that will cause side effects down the road.\u201d\n\nStan is not alone. When the 3-year-old Landon Riddle was diagnosed with Leukemia, doctors gave him only 48 hours to live. After Landon\u2019s grandmother suggested that they look into cannabis oil treatment, the family flew to Colorado where cannabis oil treatment was legal. In just days, Landon\u2019s cancer was in remission. Sierra Riddle, Landon\u2019s mother, says:\n\n\u201cIt is atrocious that anyone on the planet would be charged for choosing cannabis over pharmaceuticals. Having a sick child is a battle in itself, but making this choice is a whole new world. You\u2019re going to need thick skin, intuition, and a solid team. Don\u2019t waste time making sure every other pharmaceutical does more harm than good. If it feels wrong in your gut, it\u2019s probably wrong.\u201d\n\nWatch How A Girl\u2019s Leukemia Went into Remission After Only Six Days Of Using Cannabis Oil\n\n14-Year-Old Was Given 3 Days To Live, But Then His Mother Gave Him Cannabis Oil\n\n9-Year-Old Autistic Boy Speaks His First Words Thanks to \u201cControversial\u201d Cannabis Treatment\n\nFather Says Cannabis Extract is Curing His Son\u2019s Severe Epilepsy [VIDEO]\n\nCancer Survivor Says CBD Oil \u2018Saved Her Life\u2019 After Doctors Said She Had 6 Months To Live\n\nUS: Medical Marijuana States see Opioid Overdose Deaths drop by 25%\n\nFinally, WHO Admits Medical Marijuana Has NO Public Health Risks\n\nBritish Government Finally Admits Marijuana has a Medicinal Value, U.S. MSM Silent\n\nAfter Chemo Failed & Big Pharma Wrote Her Off, Woman Beats Blood Cancer With Turmeric\n\nWhat Does Marijuana Do To Your Lungs?\n\nLargest Ever Study on Marijuana Reveals Smoking It does not Damage the Lungs, Rather Improves It\n\nEvidence: Eating Raw Cannabis PREVENTS Cancer, Does NOT Get You High", "opengraph": {"image": "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Cannabis-Oil.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cannabis Oil Cures 80-Year-Old Dentist of Stage 4 Metastatic Lung Cancer", "description": "After months of aggressive allopathic treatment fails, elderly man with stage 4 lung cancer walks out of hospice with cannabis oil treatment", "url": "https://anonhq.com/73545-2/", "site_name": "AnonHQ", "article:published_time": "2016-09-25T21:33:26+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-04-29T21:11:49+00:00", "image:width": "560", "image:height": "292", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Cannabis Oil", "medical marijuana", "Chemotherapy Kills", "Cancer Industry"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "640", "height": "360", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWRzikJ3iso?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWRzikJ3iso?rel=0"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "696", "height": "392", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uJsHcJ6pFk?start=1&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uJsHcJ6pFk?start=1&feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://t.me/armyanonymous", "https://anonhq.com/support-us/", "https://anonhq.com/more-evidence-marijuana-causes-cancer-cells-to-commit-suicide/", "http://www.organicandhealthy.org/2016/09/elderly-man-with-terminal-cancer-walks.html", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Cannabis-Oil-1.jpg", "http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_defeatcancer164.htm", "http://www.naturalblaze.com/2016/08/cannabis-oil-cures-3-year-old-boy-of-cancer-after-doctors-gave-him-48-hours-to-live.html", "http://www.medicalmarijuana.co.uk/young-boy-given-48-hours-to-live-now-cancer-free-after-taking-cannabis-oil/", "https://anonhq.com/watch-girls-leukemia-went-remission-six-days-using-cannabis-oil/", "https://anonhq.com/14-year-old-given-3-days-live-mother-gave-cannabis-oil/", "https://anonhq.com/9-year-old-autistic-boy-speaks-his-first-words-thanks-to-controversial-cannabis-treatment/", "https://anonhq.com/father-says-cannabis-extract-curing-sons-severe-epilepsy-video/", "http://anonymous-news.com/cancer-survivor-says-cbd-oil-saved-her-life-after-doctors-said-she-had-6-months-to-live/", "https://anonhq.com/100-peer-reviewed-studies-conclude-cannabis-cures-cancer/", "https://anonhq.com/finally-big-pharma-admits-cannabis-kills-cancer-cells/", "https://anonhq.com/us-medical-marijuana-states-see-opioid-overdose-deaths-drop-25/", "https://anonhq.com/finally-admits-medical-marijuana-no-public-health-risks/", "https://anonhq.com/british-government-finally-admits-marijuana-medicinal-value-u-s-msm-silent/", "https://anonhq.com/after-chemo-failed-big-pharma-wrote-her-off-woman-beats-blood-cancer-with-turmeric/", "http://What Does Marijuana Do To Your Lungs?", "https://anonhq.com/largest-ever-study-marijuana-reveals-smoking-not-damage-lungs-rather-improves/", "https://anonhq.com/evidence-eating-raw-cannabis-prevents-cancer-does-not-get-you-high/", "https://www.patreon.com/armyanonymous\n", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10=", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10="], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2016-09-25T21:33:26+00:00"}
