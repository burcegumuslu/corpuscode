Welt wrote on March 13, \u201cLauterbach Has Had a Problem With Sincerity Since the Beginning of His Career.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t just Lauterbach who misled people.\n\nFrom the crooked r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with which Lauterbach fooled the University of T\u00fcbingen as a 32-year-old to the coronavirus crisis, there is a Lauterbachian motif: not being quite so precise. In retrospect, it began with the falsification of biographical data. It ended with his insistence, long since in ministerial office, that the coronavirus vaccines were devoid of side effects.\n\n \u2014Welt\n\nOf course, Lauterbach wasn\u2019t the only one who claimed that lockdowns were good and vaccines were safe. Politicians, scientists and media outlets around the world said the same. But how many of the so-called experts got where they are due to cheating?\n\n\u201cThere is a major crisis in the world of higher education: the large and growing number of fake universities and fake degrees,\u201d Allen Ezell and John Bear write in Degree Mills: The Billion-Dollar Industry That Has Sold Over a Million Fake Diplomas. \u201c[T]here are more than 3,300 unrecognized universities worldwide, many of them outright fakes, selling bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, doctorates, law and medical degrees to anyone willing to pay the price.\u201d\n\nThis trend is concerning as our March cover story, \u201cNavigating Our Fake World,\u201d highlights:\n\nIn today\u2019s world, no nation, people, age, race or sex is immune. Politics, government, media, economics, education, fashion, entertainment: There\u2019s an element of phoniness in them all. Every one is, to some degree, propped up by exaggeration, embellishment, clever marketing and branding, obfuscation and lies. Perhaps the most remarkable and tragic reality is this: Most people are either ignorant of or comfortable with the fakery.\n\nAs this article brings out, we live in a world filled with lies. Jeremiah 7:28 says that \u201ctruth is perished.\u201d This prophecy speaks of a time when every man \u201cwill deceive \u2026 his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies \u2026\u201d (Jeremiah 9:5). We live \u201cin the midst of deceit \u2026\u201d (verse 6).\n\nRead \u201cNavigating Our Fake World\u201d and get a free subscription to our Trumpet magazine, which reveals the truth in a world of deceit.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/27174-german-politics-reveal-a-world-of-lies", "site_name": "theTrumpet.com", "title": "German Politics Reveal a World of Lies", "image": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/files/W1siZiIsIjIwMjMvMDMvMTMvM2xmNjEwZmoyNF8yMDIzMDMxM19LYXJsX0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzXzEyMzk0ODY2NTguanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIxMDI0eCJdLFsicCIsImVuY29kZSIsImpwZyIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgwIl1d/7e80f0fd8b87701a/20230313-Karl-GettyImages-1239486658.jpg.jpg", "description": "See this and more on theTrumpet.com", "type": "website"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/plus244225919/Karl-Lauterbach-Der-dunkle-Fleck-in-seiner-Vergangenheit.html", "https://www.welt.de/debatte/plus244257011/Frisierter-Lebenslauf-Karl-Lauterbach-ist-von-Anfang-an-ein-Irrtum-gewesen-Ein-Kommentar.html", "/26884-navigating-our-fake-world", "/26884-navigating-our-fake-world"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
