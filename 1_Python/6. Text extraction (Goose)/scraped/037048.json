Image: Facebook\n\nHonesti Basyir, president director of state-owned Bio Farma, Indonesia\u2019s only vaccine manufacturer, says Pfizer wants to be immune of lawsuits resulting from any short or long-term side effects that may emerge during the rollout of the vaccine.\n\nIndonesia has still to complete a \u201ccold chain\u201d across the archipelago to handle the distribution of the vaccine, with Covid-19 Task Force spokesman Wiku Adisasmito indicating that it will be confined mainly to large urban centers.\n\nJakarta is also seeking 108 million free doses from GAVI, an alliance led by the WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF and the World Bank which was created two decades ago to improve vaccination access for the world\u2019s children.\n\nAlready considered to be unstated, Indonesia\u2019s daily infection rate has doubled from 8,000 to as much as 14,000-plus in the past two weeks, a direct result of intra-provincial travel during the Christmas-New Year holiday break.\n\nThat has boosted total infections over the 900,000 mark, with the death toll verging on 26,000, or 250-300 a day.\n\nOfficials say isolation and intensive care units are at 80% capacity as the government implements a stricter set of health protocols in Java and on the tourist island of Bali to contain the latest surge, the worst since the crisis began.\n\nEast Java leads with 6,779 deaths, followed by Central Java with 4,375, Jakarta on 3,673 and West Java with 1,294 \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s four most populous provinces that contribute to about 60% of the national total.\n\nThe lowest number of deaths have been recorded in West Kalimantan (28) and in West Sulawesi (57), the scene of last week\u2019s 6.2 earthquake which killed more than 50 people and collapsed hundreds of buildings.\n\nIn Asia, a region that appears to have escaped the full brunt of the pandemic, Indonesia has the highest number of deaths per million at 5.52%, according to Statista. But its data shows that is still far less than countries in Europe and most other parts of the world.\n\nForeign nationals have been banned from entering Indonesia until January 28 to prevent the entry of the more infectious Covid-19 strains discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil. Domestic tourists can only travel internally after undergoing a swab anti-gen test and obtaining a digital health card.\n\nBut he also warned that much also depends on the availability of supply, an issue amplified by Health Minister Sadikan this week when he said the government may allow for private vaccination schemes after the completion of the first phase of the program to help fill any gap.\n\nOfficials say they will not force the vaccine on people, but will wait before imposing sanctions, which include a 100 million rupiah fines for those who don\u2019t comply with quarantine restrictions or hinder the implementation of a vaccination program.\n\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.
