Army Secretary Christine Wormuth ordered commanders in January to begin the process of booting soldiers who outright refused the vaccine. The first three soldiers were separated for that reason on March 18.\n\nThe Army has also relieved six service leaders from command \u2014 including two battalion commanders \u2014 and issued 3,330 general officer written reprimands to soldiers for refusing the vaccination order, according to the data.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin in August ordered all service members to receive the vaccine but allowed each service to determine their own timelines.\n\nSome 97% of the Army\u2019s about 486,000 active-duty soldiers have been fully vaccinated, the service said Thursday. Those percentages remain unchanged from the previous week.\n\nSo far, the Army has approved two permanent religious waivers for the vaccine order, according to the data.\n\nAbout 836 active-duty soldiers have been denied a religious exemption, and another 4,165 are awaiting decisions on their religious waiver requests. That number is up slightly from previous weeks as soldiers continue applying for such exemptions.\n\nThe Army has approved 20 permanent medical exemptions to the vaccine, as of Thursday. The service has denied 657 permanent waiver requests and another 699 are awaiting decisions.\n\nThose denied exemptions to the Army\u2019s vaccine mandate have seven days to start the vaccination process or file an appeal of their denial before commanders are to begin the process of kicking them out, according to Wormuth\u2019s January order.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Stars and Stripes", "url": "https://www.stripes.com/branches/army/2022-04-07/army-soldiers-coronavirus-vaccine-mandate-separations-exemptions-5615926.html", "type": "article", "title": "Army nearly doubles the number of soldiers discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine", "description": "The Army has now separated 176 soldiers as of Thursday for \u201crefusing the lawful order to receive the [coronavirus] vaccine.\u201d That\u2019s up from 90 last week.", "image": "https://www.stripes.com/incoming/6ihs8u-6574775.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/6574775.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.stripes.com/branches/army/2022-04-07/army-soldiers-coronavirus-vaccine-mandate-separations-exemptions-5615926.html&linkname=Army nearly doubles the number of soldiers discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.stripes.com/branches/army/2022-04-07/army-soldiers-coronavirus-vaccine-mandate-separations-exemptions-5615926.html&linkname=Army nearly doubles the number of soldiers discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https://www.stripes.com/branches/army/2022-04-07/army-soldiers-coronavirus-vaccine-mandate-separations-exemptions-5615926.html&linkname=Army nearly doubles the number of soldiers discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/copy_link?linkurl=https://www.stripes.com/branches/army/2022-04-07/army-soldiers-coronavirus-vaccine-mandate-separations-exemptions-5615926.html&linkname=Army nearly doubles the number of soldiers discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine", "https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https://www.stripes.com/branches/army/2022-04-07/army-soldiers-coronavirus-vaccine-mandate-separations-exemptions-5615926.html&title=Army nearly doubles the number of soldiers discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine", "https://www.stripes.com/covid/", "https://ww2.stripes.com/subscribe/newsletters", "https://ww2.stripes.com/subscribe/support-the-mission"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
