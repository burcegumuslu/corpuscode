Watch on TV: Virgin 604, Freesat 216, Sky 515, Freeview 236, YouView 236 Listen on DAB+ Radio\n\nMark Steyn: Marc Morano is a best-selling author and his latest book is called the Great Reset: Global Elites and these are the words to bear in mind Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown.\n\nMorano: if you go back decades New York Times, Tom Freeman praising China\u2019s one party rule. Justin Trudeau saying he has great admiration for China\u2019s basic dictatorship. The U.N climate Chief you Christina Figueres. The Obama administration officials praising China. So what happens? COVID comes along, the World Health Organization sends a sham committee to China and after two or three days they come back and say \u2018If you want to know how to stop a virus follow China. Do what China is doing. So, the whole world like Lemmings jumping off a cliff. And the West started copying the most insane authoritarian response of literally of nailing people in their home while they\u2019re wearing hazmat suits that\u2019s what the once free West emulated.\n\nMorano: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton were president and she had pushed the \u2018two weeks to flatten the curve\u2019 in the United States, I think there would have been a huge rebellion. I think we now know that Donald Trump was literally duped by his White House COVID advisor Deborah Birx, by Anthony Fauci. They now admit it. Deborah Birx is going around boasting and swindled the president and they knew it was never going to be \u201915 days.\u2019 So Donald Trump got into that, but had it been Hillary Clinton, I think you would have had much greater rebellion in our country from people who accepted lockdowns, because they thought okay we have this under control but unfortunately, once you started that two weeks it was almost impossible to get out of it. We had an unprecedented situation this is in human history once free West overnight shut churches, gyms, schools, businesses, curfews, stay at home orders, weddings, funerals, \u2014 but hey Walmart was open. And and big Tech profit skyrocketed. We created a new billionaire every 30 hours. It was the greatest transfer of wealth from poor and middle class to the wealthy.\n\nWe\u2019re still under a 9 11 emergency power act that led to the creation of the Patriot Act which gave us the surveillance State against our own citizens. Then you have COVID added we\u2019re still under the COVID emergency. Joe Biden keeps extending it. Joe Biden now wants to add a climate emergency declaration according to Associated Press that would give him 130 new executive powers. The Scottish government has been trying to make the pandemic powers permanent and we now have medical associations ensuring doctors can\u2019t even do research or recommendations that are contrary to Public Health. Doctors can\u2019t present data if it contradicts with public health. They\u2019re trying to pass this in California. They\u2019ve passed it in Australia. And so it\u2019s an idea that this is going to be a new normal where the decisions are being made by fewer and fewer people it\u2019s a concentration of power at the top. And it\u2019s about controlling the narrative on every aspect so we are now facing thermostat controls, gas powered car bans. And here\u2019s the key, they\u2019re intentionally collapsing our energy our food our transportation and our free speech and once they collapse it that creates chaos then they claim the free market failed and now there\u2019s a whole movement afoot to nationalize everything I just mentioned, food, energy, transportation, seeking a government takeover.\n\nMorano: No one voted for gas car bans. Gov. Gavin Newsom in California issued an executive order. The California Air Resources Board, an unelected unaccountable bureaucracy, came up with the timetable the 2035 and with strict limits going up to that year. 17 States, including my home state of Virginia, have a trigger law to follow California. Biden\u2019s transportation secretary loves the gas car ban so much they\u2019re now looking at it as a federal mandate. The World Bank\u2019s former president Nicholas Stern says we have to look at timetables for ending gas cars. So the World Bank is telling automakers that gas cars are ending. A bank in Australia won\u2019t even give you a car loan if you want to buy a gas-powered car. We didn\u2019t vote for this. They\u2019re taking away our meat our gas-powered cars our free speech and our agriculture, forcing us to eat insects. We didn\u2019t vote for any of this. We didn\u2019t vote for lockdowns. We didn\u2019t vote for mask mandates, these were all done through emergency decree, through unelected bureaucracy, that is what the Great Reset is. Think back to China One party rule, they don\u2019t want any stinking democracy.\n\nMark Steyn: Marc Morano is back for more on the Great Reset\u2026Marc Morano is the author of this terrific new book The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown and he is back with us. Marc, we were talking about the requirement for vaccines.\n\nMorano: All those emergency powers are what enables governments to do this to their citizens. Yes to answer your question directly. How did this happen? Why is this\n\nvaccine allowed to be here with all these with a disproportionate adverse reaction: It\u2019s very simple. Emergency use authorization, emergency powers. You can bypass all traditional vaccine requirements and tests. They\u2019re doing this with all of the updates with children, it\u2019s all a way to bypass not only democracy, but traditional medical safety because we\u2019re in an emergency here.\n\nyou could also say Donald Trump, president Trump\u2019s whole idea to rush a vaccine to market was misguided. I know he was a private businessman who came to fame and getting things done under budget. B ut maybe an untested vaccine on the mass population that would later be used to mandate and force people and threaten them with their jobs \u2014 was the wrong thing to rush through. That\u2019s something we have to look at because in the future we don\u2019t want to be like \u2018Let\u2019s ram this thing in as fast as we can.\u2019\n\nYou mentioned informed consent. They\u2019re not giving you the information and you don\u2019t have the consent that\u2019s what they tried to take away. So that whole idea was turned on its head. Once again the premise and it goes back to what I said about emergency powers with COVID, with terrorism, with climate coming up, they\n\nwant to bypass traditional procedures democracy, medical safety, and this is the method in which they do it. They say \u2018we have to do this this, it is an urgent because it\u2019s a Public Health Crisis and\n\nMark Steyn: Y ou see across the continent these seriously collapsing fertility rates then you have reports that are now acknowledged in peer-reviewed journals, particularly in terms of women\u2019s health that the vaccines change their periods and and have impacts on breast milk, and all the rest of it just as a general proposition they don\u2019t seem worried about that because they\u2019re not\n\nMarc Morano: No it\u2019s if anything it\u2019s a side benefit that they didn\u2019t promote or think about. This is a benefit to those who worry about overpopulation, but you not only have women\u2019s menstrual cycles being affected and \u2014 by the way that was considered misinformation you would be de-platformed, canceled, taken off all social media, no one was allowed to say that, but now it\u2019s in the New York Times, The Washington Post, in peer- review journals \u2014 but you have women\u2019s cycles being interrupted but you also have men\u2019s sperm counts dropping with the vaccine and with the boosters. So combine those two and you\u2019re going to have lower fertility rates. Now they claim it\u2019s a temporary effect on male fertility but again we don\u2019t have long-term tests to know what\u2019s temporary because this is emergency use we don\u2019t have time. Remember, Greta Thunberg said \u2018I want you to panic,\u2019 because when you panic you do incredibly stupid, dangerous things and you play with people\u2019s lives.\n\nBut to your point, we\u2019ve dealt with this before, this idea of affecting feritliy, with drug hinted at in our water and food supply and it goes on to talk about in both Africa and the United States they wanted to add a sterility agent drug that would suppress US population growth and create less fertility, less reproduction. This was Paul Ehrlich. And then you have Jacques Cousteau, actually saying at one point we need to lose 350 000 people per day in order to bring the Earth\u2019s population down to a reasonable level, that Earth can handle.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Watch: Morano on Mark Steyn\u2019s UK TV show \u2013 2 Live Segments on The Great Reset: Morano: \u2018Decisions are being made by fewer & fewer people, it\u2019s a concentration of power at the top\u2019", "url": "https://www.climatedepot.com/2022/10/03/watch-morano-on-mark-steyns-uk-tv-show-2-live-segments-on-the-great-reset-morano-decisions-are-being-made-by-fewer-fewer-people-its-a-concentration-of-power-at-the-top/", "description": "First Live Interview \u2013 Broadcast September 28, 2022 \u2013 (Also watch the below segment here: ) Mark Steyn interviews author Marc Morano on his book Great Reset which reveals some uncomfort\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-10-03T14:33:34+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-10-03T15:02:47+00:00", "site_name": "Climate Depot", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["medicacd", "trump", "reset", "lockdowns", "wef", "china"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ILQxdjHyx8", "http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-15.08.51.png", "http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-15.09.02.png", "http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-15.10.22.png", "http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-15.10.53.png", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n91uNaEOPU&list=WL&index=13", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDbqjkfNn_0&list=WL&index=14", "https://www.youtube.com/c/GBNewsOnline", "http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-15.04.04.png", "http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-15.04.24.png", "http://www.climatedepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-15.04.39.png", "https://www.amazon.com/Great-Reset-Global-Permanent-Lockdown/dp/1684512387"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-10-03T14:33:34+00:00"}
