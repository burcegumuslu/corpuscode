The virus spreads through saliva, which is why this infection is sometimes referred to as \u201ckissing disease.\u201d This disease most commonly occurs in teens and young adults, although it can affect anyone at any age. Mononucleosis is also known as glandular fever.\n\nThe side effects of mononucleosis typically appear four to six weeks after you get infected with EBV. They may develop slowly and may not all be present at the same time. Its side effects include extreme fatigue, fever, sore throat, head and body aches, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, swollen liver or spleen or both, and rashes. Although less common, enlarged spleen and a swollen liver may also occur. These symptoms usually go away after two to four weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for a few more weeks. Occasionally, the side effects of mononucleosis can last for six months or more. Other complications that may occur due to mononucleosis include anemia, thrombocytopenia, inflammation of the heart, complications that involve the nervous system, such as meningitis, and swollen tonsils that can affect breathing.\n\nThe body systems harmed by mononucleosis include the immune, nervous, digestive, and respiratory systems.\n\nList of foods or nutrients that prevent mononucleosis\n\nThere is no information on what foods prevent mononucleosis. However, foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins C and E, zinc, healthy fats, lean protein, and whole grains are recommended for people with mononucleosis.\n\nThere is no cure for mononucleosis, although there are treatments available to manage its symptoms.
