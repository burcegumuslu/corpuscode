The dismissed individuals all had accepted religious exemptions. Several weeks after, the SDCCD announced that it was firing three more unvaccinated staff members.\n\nSDCCD remains the only college system in California to still have a policy in place to fire employees for refusing COVID-19 vaccines due to their religious convictions. (Related: OBEY: University of California announces flu vaccine mandate for all campuses.)\n\n\u201cI am one of at least 30 Christian employees at SDCCD that have been purposely targeted for termination, even now, for not accepting to take a fetus cell-tainted injection,\u201d wrote mathematics professor Carlos De La Lama in an email to Life Site News.\n\nThe SDCCD initially had a fairly open policy regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. It had a mandate, but people with medical conditions and sincerely held religious beliefs would be granted exemptions.\n\nBut the situation changed following pressure from the local chapter of the American Federation of Teachers union, who claimed that the lack of a properly enforced COVID-19 vaccine mandate affected the health of their members.\n\nDe La Lama, who has worked for the SDCC for over three years, including 26 years as department chair, noted that all employees who had previously received exemptions had to reapply with \u201ca whole new level of scrutiny and criteria.\u201d\n\nJoanna Aud, one of the first employees terminated on Jan. 19, said in an interview that her primary job was to prepare classes alone in a lab. Despite this, she was still denied a religious accommodation.\n\n\u201cStudents are not required to be vaccinated,\u201d said Aud. \u201cSo, as a student, I could actually enroll in a class that typically I would prep. I could be in that class as a student [in] a full classroom [with] no problem. But I have been denied an accommodation to actually prep that class alone in an empty classroom. Somehow, that\u2019s an undue hardship [for the SDCCD].\u201d\n\nChristians being targeted for refusal to get vaccinated\n\nAmy Reichert, a member of anti-COVID-19 mandate lobbying group ReOpen San Diego, noted that the SDCCD\u2019s decision is \u201cimmoral, anti-American and anti-science.\u201d In an interview, she noted that the college\u2019s decision is an attack against Christians.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, [I think] it\u2019s an attack on Christians,\u201d she added. \u201cI know that sounds like a lot, but the people that got fired \u2026 are people who are immigrants, people who are Latino\u201d and others who are Black. Because of the lack of a possible political or racialized pattern to the firings, the only remaining possibility suggests that this is an anti-Christian campaign.\n\nSix more devoutly Christian employees who have refused COVID-19 vaccinations are slated to be terminated following the upcoming meeting of the SDCCD board of trustees on March 2. If the SDCCD proceeds with these targeted mass terminations, Reichert warned that ReOpen San Diego is going to take the college to court.\n\n\u201cStand down. Reverse course. You\u2019re hurting and you\u2019re harming your own employees,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re violating their civil rights\u2026 A legal freight train is coming your way. You will not do this to your employees.\u201d\n\nWatch this episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how approximately 7,500 Americans are being killed or disabled every day after COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nHouse Republicans press DoD about its COVID \u201cvaccine\u201d mandate reversal: Stop discriminating against unvaccinated troops!\n\nPOLITICAL COURAGE: Ron DeSantis wants Florida Legislature to permanently ban COVID-19 mask and vaccine mandates.\n\nCalifornia will now punish doctors for not agreeing with the official narrative of COVID.\n\nNational Education Association board member says unvaccinated with religious exemptions \u201cshould die or be shot.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "More than 30 Christian employees FIRED by San Diego\u2019s community college system for refusing COVID-19 vaccinations", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.health.news/2023-02-23-christians-fired-college-system-over-covid-vaccinations.html", "site_name": "Health News", "description": "San Diego\u2019s community college system has fired over two dozen Christian employees for refusing to take the experimental and dangerous Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.
