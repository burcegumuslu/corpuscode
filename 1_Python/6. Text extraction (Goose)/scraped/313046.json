I know, it\u2019s a shocking idea! Well, the Journal of the American Medical Association wants to put this to rest for good and they\u2019ve conducted an enormous study using 95,000 children as subjects in order to check the \u201cgood science\u201d box once and for all. Here\u2019s the takeaway:\n\nNo harmful association, at all, none, zero. But somehow I don\u2019t feel like this will be enough for those parents who are already 100% checked out of reality and still basing their healthcare beliefs (selectively) on a scientist who made up his research and got caught. Nope, this thing is self-sufficient at this point with dozens of small organizations spilling daily FUD onto the interwebs in the hopes of harvesting clicks and selling bogus therapies and medicines.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the offenders I hit upon just today. Feel free to check my work by reading each article and researching each organization if you don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying.\n\nThe real story with that one is that the vaccine was bad, not that measles vaccines kill. This is a problem but it\u2019s not a problem with proper measles vaccines.\n\nThe above is from The Children\u2019s Medical Safety Research Institute which is an independent institute in Australia. They think vaccines are dangerous and they share links to articles on sites, like the above, that say vaccines are just a money making scam despite it being an historically extremely unprofitable endeavor for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAgain, these kids died from an adverse reaction to the vaccine which has nothing do with the safety of vaccines generally. The reporting is so terrible that I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s not completely made up. This is being shared by The National Vaccine Information Center which is just an anti-vax group pretending to be an actual scientific institute. It isn\u2019t.\n\nUtter nonsense clickbait. They claim measles was never a problem until the vaccine came along which is a bald faced lie. Historically, measles has killed tens of millions of people and that\u2019s a conservative estimate. As recently as 2013, over 145,000 people died of measles globally. That\u2019s down from 875,000 in 1999. The difference is all down to vaccines.\n\nBut this is what it\u2019s come to, a self propagating conspiracy fest based on some vague notion that the government is covering up the dangers of vaccines in order to, what, give children autism? Institute mind control? Prep the people for an eventual poisonous vaccine to wipe out parts of the population?\n\nThis is end of the world paranoiac stuff. Yes, some children have adverse reaction to vaccines and that\u2019s bad but millions more are saved by these vaccines. But the facts don\u2019t matter to these people and any scientific nuance appears to be met with a righteous and determined hand waving session.\n\nThey won\u2019t believe it. They\u2019re too invested now.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "95,000 Child Study Proves That Measles Vaccine Doesn\u2019t Cause Autism But The True Believers Won\u2019t Be Satisfied", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/james-b-barnes/2015/04/95000-child-study-proves-that-measles-vaccine-doesnt-cause-autism/", "description": "No harmful association, at all, none, zero.", "article:published_time": "2015-04-21T20:48:10+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2015-04-21T20:49:29+00:00", "site_name": "Thought Catalog", "image": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9291594310_30f627e7bf_h.jpg?w=1536&h=768&crop=1", "image:width": "1536", "image:height": "768", "locale": "en_US", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/richard.barnes.31392410"}, "tags": ["News", "Health & Wellness", "The Digital Age", "Current Events", "Vaccines", "Parenting"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Six dead from measles vaccine.
