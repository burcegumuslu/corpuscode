(For example, perirectal lesions can induce painful sphincter spasms.)\n\nSo, in terms of deaths, in 2022 there are now a total of 5 deaths that have been associated with Moneypox reported outside Africa, and 4 reported from Nigeria. I found only two for which there was discussion of cause of death: the Brazilian had lymphoma (lymph cancer), and the person from Peru died of a preexisting condition. We know nothing about what killed the other seven.\n\nCDC has been hiding its vaccine study of 1600 Congolese healthcare workers\n\nCDC began a study of the Jynneos vaccine in the DRC in 2017 and finished recruiting by September 2020, according to the required notification in ClinicalTrials.gov. The idea was to vaccinate people most susceptible to monkeypox and see how many got monkeypox, and what the side effects were. CDC has a lot of data, and the person who briefed the advisory committee on June 23, Brett Peterson, is the Principal Investigator of this Congo trial. Where is CDC\u2019s briefing on this study\u2019s results? This was the first study of vaccine efficacy in the world\u2014why is CDC being coy about the results?\n\nThe same 2 scientists who hyped COVID\u2019s natural origin now hyping Monkeypox\u2019 natural origin\n\nTwo of the same scientists who hyped the natural origin of COVID are now trying to explain the excessive number of mutations in the current Moneypox variant, which appears to be derived from a strain isolated in labs in 3 countries in 2018-9. Double-stranded DNA viruses don\u2019t usually mutate this fast\u2026since we have a 2018 start date, the mutations expected could be calculated. A lot of the mutations could have been induced by an enzyme used in labs. See DoorlessCarp\u2019s June 5 update for more on the science.\n\nThe two people are Andrew Rambaut and Michael Worobey. Rambaut was one of the 5 authors of the Nature Medicine article that Tony Fauci caused to be written, to cover up the lab origin that Fauci himself funded. Worobey just published an article claiming\u2014despite everything\u2014that COVID came from nature. Now they are doing the same for Monkeypox.\n\nUS Government has created a fake shortage of vaccine\n\nWell yes, of course, they always do that to fan the flames of demand.\n\nBut this is a lot bigger than that. The USG already owns 16 million doses, stored frozen in Denmark, and had spent well over $1 Billion on Jynneos vaccines before Moneypox was identified in the west.\n\nDespite the Denmark factory\u2019s \u201cfill and finish\u201d facility being completed in 2021, and despite the USG allotting $44 million for \u201cqualification\u201d of that same facility in January 2019, the FDA only got around to finishing its inspection on July 27, 2022.\n\nSupposedly this prevented the US from getting its hands on any of its supply stored overseas. Duh? And the USG ordered 1.4 million doses as recently as 2020, yet to be delivered.\n\nMeantime, President Biden asked for another $7 Billion for the $Moneypox emergency. No wonder they plan to change the name of Moneypox, which is said to be stigmatizing to Africans. They mislead. It is stigmatizing to politicians.\n\nBecause of the vaccine shortage, existing vaccine will get a liability waiver\n\nHow sweet is that?\n\nJynneos is licensed, and is being used for its labelled indication (prevention of Moneypox) so the manufacturer is liable for injuries. The USG might also be liable, if it steered you wrong about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine\u2026or if it hid a study it had conducted, for example.\n\nBut since we have a shortage, the USG in its benevolence and wisdom is going to dilute it and give recipients instead a 20% dose, administered intradermally instead of subcutaneously. But in order to make this kosher (kosher for whom?) the DHHS and FDA are issuing the vaccine an emergency use authorization, and we all know what that means. You can\u2019t sue anybody even if the vaccine kills you.\n\nYou can apply to DHHS for small benefits from its Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, but you might be waiting a long time for an answer. The program has denied about 95% of petitioners, and no one has received a payout for a COVID vaccine injury yet.\n\nThis also means that a USG contractor will now be inserted between the Danish manufacturer and the recipient. I wonder what diluent the USG will instruct them to add, or supply itself, for that matter?\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nThe God of All Comfort\n\nYear 2023: Will America Fulfill Its Destiny?
