The industry represents a significant carbon footprint. Which is why U.S. start-up Biomilq hopes to artificially produce \u2018real\u2019 human breast milk from cultured mammary epithelial cells.\n\nBiomilq is making sufficient progress with the advanced biotechnology research involved to believe it could have a commercially viable product within five years. The company produced proof of concept for its plans back in February, with a process that produced both lactose and casein, two key components of human breast milk.\n\nBiomilq\u2019s founders are Michelle Egger, a food scientist, and Leila Strickland, a cell biologist. Strickland struggled to breastfeed her now 10-year-old son when he was born prematurely. This motivated her to look for a better solution than traditional baby formula. She said:\n\u2022 Digested formula, but not breast milk, is toxic to cells, in vitro study finds\n\nShe teamed up with Egger, who had been looking into better breast milk alternatives while working at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Egger was then focused on \u201caffordable plant-based protein sources for low-and-middle-income countries.\u201d However, she was excited by Strickland\u2019s confidence that science has progressed quickly enough that lab-cultured human breast milk was becoming a viable alternative.\n\nLast September, the two scientists founded Biomilq and secured funding through Gate\u2019s Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund. The fund\u2019s board members include a star roster of entrepreneurs including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, Sir Richard Branson, and Michael Bloomberg, the financial data and media mogul who is also the former mayor of New York.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Artificial Breast Milk Start-Up Gets $3.5 Million From Bill Gates-Founded Investment Fund", "description": "Biomilq, a NC-based start-up targeting infant nutrition by attempting to reproduce mothers' breast milk in a lab, is backed by Bill Bates.", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/artificial-breast-milk-start-up-gets-3-5-million-from-bill-gates-founded-investment-fund/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2020-06-21T01:18:54-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-01-30T17:02:37-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-01-30T17:02:37-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shutterstock_1052568785.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shutterstock_1052568785.jpg", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "667"}, "tags": ["Health"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"BIOMILQ\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNbYlk6NL9c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNbYlk6NL9c?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-exposes-bill-gates-his-relationship-with-big-pharma/", "https://healthnutnews.com/studies-show-breastfeeding-lowers-your-breast-cancer-risk/", "https://healthnutnews.com/mom-posts-video-of-4-year-old-daughter-breastfeeding/", "https://healthnutnews.com/digested-formula-but-not-breast-milk-is-toxic-to-cells-in-vitro-study-finds/", "https://healthnutnews.com/worlds-richest-man-cuts-health-benefits-for-1900-whole-foods-workers/", "https://healthnutnews.com/mark-zuckerberg-to-shift-facebook-toward-a-privacy-focused-platform-within-a-few-years/", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8439159/Artificial-breast-milk-start-gets-3-5-million-Bill-Gates-founded-investment-fund.html", "tg://msg?text=Artificial%20Breast%20Milk%20Start-Up%20Gets%20%243.5%20Million%20From%20Bill%20Gates-Founded%20Investment%20Fund - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fartificial-breast-milk-start-up-gets-3-5-million-from-bill-gates-founded-investment-fund%2F", "mailto:?subject=Artificial%20Breast%20Milk%20Start-Up%20Gets%20%243.5%20Million%20From%20Bill%20Gates-Founded%20Investment%20Fund&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fartificial-breast-milk-start-up-gets-3-5-million-from-bill-gates-founded-investment-fund%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-06-21T01:18:54-05:00"}
