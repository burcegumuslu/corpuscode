We can learn from the steps taken by the South Korean government to answer these questions. According to December 2022 data, 39.85 million doses of vaccine were administered in South Korea in one year. Previously, TrialSite reported that South Korea has a higher vaccination rate compared to other countries. According to a study by Jeong et al., South Korea has not only expanded vaccination but also learned lessons from the pandemic and worked to build a health system ready for future health hazards.&nbsp;\nFollowing the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines in Korea, the Korean Agency for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCA) formed a research group of experts from the National Academy of Medicine of Korea (NAMOK) to assess vaccine-induced side effects. This research group, established in 2021 and called the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Research Committee (CoVaSC), has three committees: epidemiology, clinical research, and communications. The CoVaSC&rsquo;s head is Dr. Park Byung-joo who is also NAMOK&rsquo;s vice president. He said that the committee&rsquo;s aim is to provide a scientific basis for assessing the potential links between adverse events and vaccination. CoVaSC began working to build scientific evidence for policy guidelines, completing the effects of vaccine-induced side effects on 15 different diseases, and conducting several scientific studies in 2022. Let us take a closer look at the committee's working principles to examine how CoVaSC builds systematic scientific evidence for public information and policy guidance.&nbsp;"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
