See the video below. At the same time, a first hearing at the Marseille civil court took place on Monday January 9, following the action of lawyer Eric Lanzarone, defending nearly 300 clients who contracted illnesses shortly after their vaccination against Covid-19.\n\n\n\nMe Jean-Pierre Joseph\u2019s criminal complaint was filed with the Paris Court of Justice, P\u00f4le Sant\u00e9. The civil party is represented in particular by Marc Doyer, spokesperson for the association of victims of Covid vaccines Verity France: His wife Mauricette (ER: a French singer) died on June 23, 2021 of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease following a Pfizer injection.\n\nThe lawyer is going after Pfizer, as well as former Prime Minister Jean Castex and the Minister of Health at the time Olivier V\u00e9ran (who had claimed that the Covid vaccination had no connection with the Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease), as well as all the ministers and elected officials who had a responsibility in the vaccination campaign.\n\nMarc Doyer calls on all victims or families of victims of this terrible disease, as well as other effects of Covid vaccines, to join this action, the legal costs being covered. Already 20 families are ready to join in.\n\nAs for the hearing held in Marseille, it will be a legal marathon for Marseille lawyer Eric Lanzarone and his client, a 55-year-old woman who prefers to remain anonymous.\n\nThe lawyer will try to have the rheumatoid arthritis developed by his client recognized, \u201ca few days after her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine (\u2026) Today, she cannot walk more than 300 to 400 meters and has since been on sick leave. It is a totally disabling side effect, \u201dhe told the newspaper 20 minutes.\n\nThe hearing aims for the appointment of a medical expert to establish the causal link between the vaccinations and the development of this inflammatory joint disease.\n\nFacing him, Capucine Van Robays represents the eight lawyers of Pfizer France, a branch of the American pharma company which manufactures the most injected \u201canti-Covid\u201d vaccine in France. Me Lanzarone also subpoenaed the German company BioNTech, the laboratory which developed the vaccine.\n\nThe lawyer had already obtained, in October 2022 in Paris, the appointment of a medical expert in an identical case. \u201cIn Marseille, I also subpoenaed BioNTech, because during the hearing in Paris, Pfizer had discharged itself on this laboratory\u201d, he explains. (ER: We\u2019re not sure what this machine translated phrase means. Had Pfizer severed connections somehow with BioNTech, a German company?)\n\nEric Lanzarone says he has 300 similar files. \u201cI often find identical pathologies: visual impairment, endometriosis, a lot of myocarditis\u201d.\n\nThe lawyer who claims \u201cnot to be antivax\u201d (ER: Why does this point have to be made?) had previously attacked the clause of the contract between Pfizer and the European Commission which provides that in the event of adverse effects, compensation is borne by the States. \u201cIt amounts to privatizing the profits and socializing the risks. I consider that it is not up to French taxpayers to pay for the undesirable effects, \u201dhe accuses.\n\nFor this, it will already be necessary that the possibly designated expert concludes well on the link between vaccination and development of diseases. Then, a new section will open on the amount of compensation.\n\nNearly 140 million injections in France, all doses combined, according to data from Public Health France and compiled by CovidTracker.
