With enough taxpayer cash at his disposal, Califf can steer the FDA in whichever direction he chooses, which apparently means turning the regulatory body into a censorship and snitch operation.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press (AP), Califf, who previously headed the FDA in 2016 and 2017, partially under both Barack Obama and Donald Trump, pledged that the FDA under his leadership is committed to \u201csave lives\u201d by fighting against the First Amendment online.\n\nEven though almost nobody trusts the FDA anymore after what the agency did throughout the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) scamdemic, Califf is convinced that he has an important job to do \u201chelping the public get the accurate, science-based information they need to use medical products and foods to maintain and improve their health in the face of a tsunami of confusing and misleading information.\u201d\n\nAllowing people to speak freely online about things like pharmaceuticals and vaccines is a threat to public health, Califf argues, because free thought tends to steer people away from Big Pharma\u2019s products.\n\nTo Califf, anything other than full acceptance of all drugs and vaccines is \u201ca leading cause of death in America.\u201d He believes that anything contradictory to full acceptance constitutes \u201cdistortions and half-truths.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost no one should be dying of covid in the U.S. today,\u201d Califf said, adding that anyone who rejects getting \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Fauci Flu is \u201cdying because they\u2019re misinformed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to \u201crestructuring the agency\u2019s food safety program and more aggressively deploying FDA scientists to explain vaccine decisions in the media,\u201d Califf says the FDA under his leadership is laser-focused on combating \u201cmisinformation\u201d in the digital public square.\n\nWhen he first took office last year, Califf swore that he would help usher in changes to the way people are allowed to talk online. He wants to see all skeptical speech disappear from the internet because it causes some people to \u201ceschew interventions that would improve their health.\u201d\n\n\u201cA purely reactive mode is not appropriate, particularly in this new era of social media,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the time, Califf said it would take about a year to see his plans come to fruition. We are now at roughly the one-year mark and Califf\u2019s agenda has been laid bare for the world to see.\n\n\u201cProviding factual info is the key to helping people make the best-informed decisions about their health,\u201d Califf announced in an Aug. 5, 2022, tweet about the progress being made.\n\nBefore working at the FDA, Califf worked at Verily, a life sciences company owned by Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company. While there, he scoped the internet in search of \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Califf would enter the revolving door from industry to regulator by taking the top seat at the FDA, where he is now pushing his anti-free speech agenda while on the taxpayer dole.\n\nCaliff is particularly incensed that some members of the public express \u201cfaux outrage and lies\u201d in response to FDA announcements, especially when they center around new vaccines and other drugs that industry players are trying to push on the masses.\n\nThe \u201caverage patient,\u201d Califf says, is unable \u201cto separate the truth from the lies,\u201d and thus needs Califf to manage the truth himself.\n\nMore of the latest news about the corrupt FDA can be found at FDA.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "FDA claims it will \u201csave lives\u201d by silencing speech online, making sure no one is allowed to talk about natural medicine, prevention or cures", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2023-02-28-fda-save-lives-silencing-speech-misinformation-censorship.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "One of the number-one priorities of the Biden regime\u2019s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d online, which Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf claims is a \u201cleading cause of death\u201d in the United States.
