[WEF] is taking hits, and the leader of Blackrock doesn\u2019t know why people are criticizing ESG. EM lets everyone know what the \u201cS\u201d stands for in ESG. [JK] says the quiet part out loud, they need more money to make their system operational. [JB] says he will veto the IRS bill. The patriots have now taken the house, the house is clean and investigation can begin. Trump has the declas documents, did he just signal that it is almost time to release some the declas docs. [JB]/[HB] are now trapped in the narrative, they have become a liability and the [DS] needs to remove them before the investigation lead way pass the Biden\u2019s. The Delaware prosecutor is about to release damaging information about the Biden\u2019s. Will [JB] be taken out by the 25th amendment?\n\u2022 Republican Wyoming lawmakers proposed a ban on the sale of electric vehicles by 2035 to protect the state\u2019s gas and oil industry.\n\u2022 The lawmakers said the electric vehicle charging stations would require too much power to \u201csustain the misadventure of electric vehicles.\u201d A group of GOP Wyoming state lawmakers want to end electric vehicle sales there by 2035, saying the move will help safeguard the oil and gas industries. The measure, introduced to the state legislature on Friday, was sponsored by six state legislators, who said in it that electric vehicles will hinder Wyoming\u2019s ability to trade with other states. The bill states that citizens and industries would be encouraged not to purchase electric vehicles before the ban goes into effect. \u201cThe proliferation of electric vehicles at the expense of gas-powered vehicles will have deleterious impacts on Wyoming\u2019s communities and will be detrimental to Wyoming\u2019s economy and the ability for the country to efficiently engage in commerce,\u201d the bill reads.\n\u2022 100% of all cars sold in California by 2035 must be \u2018free of fossil fuel emissions.\u2019\n\u2022 It is unclear how California drivers will be able to charge millions of electric vehicles in a state plagued by rolling blackouts.\n\nWatch: Larry Fink Complains ESG Criticism Has Become Personal and Ugly\n\u2022 Kerry put his finger on the target and shared what he really wants.\n\u2022 Kerry claims to be behind efforts to reduce carbon emissions based on fake science, but is that really what he is after?\n\u2022 He shared what he really wants. It\u2019s not climate control, it\u2019s money. Lots and lots of money.\n\u2022 WTRF Kerry shared this in his talk at Davos. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry says that despite nearly a $1 trillion committed by global philanthropies for various causes over the last few years, only 2% of this amount goes toward climate action. He said during a panel session at the World Economic Forum in Davos that it\u2019s estimated from $7.5 billion to $12.5 billion of global philanthropy is directed toward climate action. He and others urged philanthropies across the world to come together and contribute more to climate action. \u201cSo how do we get there?\u201d Kerry asked about keeping global climate goals alive. He answered, \u201cWell, the lesson I\u2019ve learned in the last year \u2014 I learned it as secretary of state and it has since been reinforced in spades, is money, money, money, money, money, money, money.\u201d\n\u2022 The WEF and the elites want money and lots of it.\n\nKari Lake\u2019s Campaign Responds to CNN Report She\u2019s Challenging Kyrsten Sinema for Arizona Senate Seat\n\u2022 CNN is reporting that Lake is eyeing the Senate seat currently being held by Kyrsten Sinema, who has perturbed Democrats nationwide by becoming an Independent.\n\u2022 As Kari Lake said before the midterm election, she is intent on combating corruption in the nation\u2019s politics and elections.\n\nQuite possibly. I think you hit the nail on the head earlier in the show. It\u2019s a clean-up job. There\u2019s no reason for her to be out there, other than they are trying to cover up something else. And if you have Adam Schiff, the New York Times, CNN, and all these Democrats saying, oh his inadvertent mishandling of classified documents. They\u2019re all singing that song. It lets you know that that\u2019s the cover-up it\u2019s not the actual story.
