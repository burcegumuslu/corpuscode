Presently, a handful of studies from different countries offer a conflicting view of whether natural immunity actually is superior to vaccinated immunity, or a combination of prior infection and vaccination.\n\nSince it\u2019s likely the federal government\u2019s aim to roll out vaccine mandates that cover practically every US worker (they\u2019re not too far off already), the issue of natural vs. vaccine immunity and whether some individuals should receive exemptions based on their antibody levels almost certainly be adjudicated in the federal courts.\n\nAt least one attorney quoted by Yahoo agrees:\n\nAs we reported when it was first published, a report out of Israel suggests that natural immunity could be many times more effective than the Pfizer vaccine at preventing infection with the delta variant. That study has yet to be peer-reviewed, however, and the world is anxiously awaiting the results.\n\nHowever, another peer-reviewed study cited by the CDC looks at dozens of cases in the US where certain people who tested positive for COVID never ended up generating the antibodies, which, science dictates, are necessary to fend off future infection.\n\nThe CDC also published a study of 246 Kentucky residents, concluding that vaccination offers higher protection than a previous COVID infection. The CDC said the study went through a \u201crigorous multi-level clearance process\u201d before submission, but now some are concerned it\u2019s slightly out of date since it pre-dates the rise of delta.\n\nBut as far as supporting natural vs. vaccinated immunity goes, this study is another big one: A C A June study by the Cleveland Clinic and Washington University tracked 52,238 Cleveland Clinic employees found that within 1,359 previously infected and unvaccinated people, none contracted a subsequent COVID-19 infection over the five-month study. The findings led authors to conclude that prior infection makes a person \u201cunlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d\n\nThe legal and scientific standards are intertwined here, but as more data develops that appears to validate the argument that natural immunity is at least as effective as vaccinated immunity, it\u2019s more likely that lawyers will succeed in convincing judges that the standard should be\n\nLike Waking Times on Facebook.
