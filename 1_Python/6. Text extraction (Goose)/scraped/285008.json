They are quite capable of doing the same again, pulling the plug on them all.\u201d\n\u2022 Towards the Real New World Order (Batiushka)\n\nNow we are talking about a real \u2018New World Order\u2019. This is being fought for in the Ukraine and in world political and economic fora at this very moment. And its ideological and military leader is the Russian Federation, the only country with the guts to lead the real New World Order. This will be to its credit for as long as the world lasts. In this context the Saker has written an excellent article, titled with the following hypothetical question: \u201cWhat would a Russian Defeat Mean for the People of the West?\u201d Although the Saker has given an excellent answer, I would give my own, which is a summary of his. This is: A Russian defeat at the hands of the \u2018Combined West\u2019 would mean the end of the world and therefore no New World Order. Fear not, since Russia is not about to be defeated, the world is not going to end just yet and there is going to be, and there already is, a New World Order. Let us be frank, the Combined West has attacked Russia again and again in history. Many do not know that the Teutonic Knights in the thirteenth century were international, pan-Western. The Napoleonic Invasion of 1812 was carried out by twelve Western nationalities. The Crimean War, i. e., the 1854 Invasion of Russia, was carried out by the French, the British, the Ottomans and the Sardinians. As for the Austro-Hungarian Army and the Kaiser\u2019s Army in 1914, that too was an effort of the Combined West, and if it had not been for the Revolution, Russia would have taken Vienna and Berlin later in 1917. And Hitler\u2019s invasion 27 years later was equally multinational. And such is the case today, with the Kiev regime\u2019s mercenary army, armed by multinational NATO. Today the US mentors of the Kiev regime are desperate for peace talks to begin. Peace could have been had at any time between February 2014 and April 2022. The US did not want it then and did not allow it then, so now they will have to pay the price. The US elite knows that they are about to lose big time. This is their last chance and the last chance for the former Ukraine \u2013 for that is what we are talking about now. Like so many, these Americans have big mouths, but when it comes to it, it is all just hot air. And although Russia is talking at the US request in order to keep channels open, it is ignoring ridiculous American demands. Today Russia has no reason to talk. It is successfully fighting against and so demilitarising NATO in the Ukraine. Everybody knows it. However, we are also at a dangerous moment because the US is losing control of its puppets. Just as it promoted Hussein in Iraq or Bin Laden in Afghanistan, ISIS in Syria and any number of Latin American gangster-puppets and then lost control of them because they refused to behave as puppets, so they risk losing control now. The lickspittle Kiev regime and its allies in Poland, the Baltics and even in the UK (there they have been singing even pop songs with an American accent for over sixty years) are being more American than the Americans. The pupil is worse than the teacher. The recent provocation of a Ukrainian missile landing in Poland and the Poles and Latvians claiming it was Russian is an example, The Americans refused to fall for it. Before that the threat of a dirty bomb being prepared by the Kiev regime was another example. Alarmed, the Americans stopped that nonsense. The UK\u2019s anti-German destruction of the Nordstream pipeline was yet another example. The culprit was covered up, just as the Americans covered up the culprits of MH-17. In Kiev, Warsaw, the Baltics and in London, they should remember what the Americans did to Hussein and Bin Laden. They are quite capable of doing the same again, pulling the plug on them all.\n\nWarsaw and Kiev try to drag the US directly into war, but the US refuses.\n\nUS officials have called on their European and Ukrainian counterparts to tread lightly when commenting on a deadly missile blast in Poland, Politico reported on Thursday. According to three Western officials interviewed by the outlet, over the last couple of days US officials have asked their European colleagues and the office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to be careful when speaking about what caused the blast. They also reportedly made a series of urgent phone calls in which they requested that their NATO allies not make any definitive statements until an investigation is carried out. The outreach efforts come as Western and Ukrainian officials have been at loggerheads about who was responsible for the explosion in the Polish village of Przewodow close to the Ukrainian border that killed two people. While Western officials have said that the blast was probably caused by a Ukrainian missile, Kiev insists that it was Russian in origin. According to Politico, these statements \u201cillustrate one of the first major divergences in opinion between Washington and Kiev\u201d since the start of Russia\u2019s military campaign in the neighboring state in late February. US officials are trying to downplay this rift, but new fissures between Washington and Kiev may emerge as the conflict drags on, the report says. According to Heather Conley, a former State Department official, the \u201cconfusion\u201d surrounding the Poland missile incident was a \u201creally important test run\u201d for the US, NATO, and Ukraine. \u201cI think we all learned a pretty valuable lesson in [that] you cannot say something right off the bat until you understand what it is \u2026 because the stakes are so high right now,\u201d she told Politico. Following the Tuesday blast, Zelensky pinned the blame on Russia, calling the incident \u201ca very serious escalation\u201d and describing it as an attack on NATO and demanding a response. Later, however, he toned down his claims, admitting that \u201cwe do not know 100%\u201d what caused the blast. The Russian Defense Ministry denied any involvement in the incident, saying its military experts had analyzed the photos from the scene and identified the debris as parts of an S-300 air defense system missile used by Ukraine.\n\nAnd here\u2019s why the US refuses.\n\nBy Lidia Misnik, a Moscow-based reporter focused on the political process, sociology and international relations.\n\n\u201cWe approached the moment of truth in the confrontation between the collective West and Russia. When it happened, it became clear that an attack by Russia could be claimed. This situation tested the effectiveness of NATO\u2019s strategy for ensuring the security of the collective West,\u201d Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies Vladimir Vasiliev told RT. He noted that the incident itself featured an element of happenstance, but that it helped shed light on a long-standing question: To what extent is the West prepared to invoke Article Five to defend NATO members? As Vasiliev noted, in this situation, the West \u201cput the brakes on everything,\u201d and the US quickly took cover behind the version that it was a Ukrainian rocket. \u201cThere was always a question about the extent to which the US would be prepared to intervene on behalf of Riga, Vilnius, or Warsaw, and in doing so sacrifice Boston, Chicago, or California. And now it becomes clear that there is a problem and that the US is not willing to sacrifice its own security, its own territories,\u201d Vasiliev said. In his words, this episode is extremely important for Russia, because it shows that the US is not prepared to invoke Article Five until there is a danger to the country itself or at least to some of the most important member states of the bloc, primarily Western Europe. \u201cThere is a certain understanding that conflicts such as this one should be resolved by others. The US will gladly put Poland, the Baltic States, Bulgaria, and Romania in the line of fire while itself staying out of the war zone. That\u2019s where the entire NATO architecture begins to crumble. Domestic politics will always take precedence,\u201d Vasiliev added. From this situation, he believes, a far-reaching conclusion can be drawn: Ukraine in any shape or form is not wanted by NATO. Vasiliev says it is clear that the US is playing a geopolitical game against Russia by using Ukraine, which is expendable. This allows the vital interests of Washington to remain untouched. According to him, the countries of Eastern Europe are equally considered not to be vital interests, as are Finland and Sweden, and likely T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nThe calm before the storm in Ukraine \u2013 MacGregor\n\n\n\n\u201cThis complex fraud will smolder for a few weeks before it explodes into an extinction-grade event for the Democratic Party..\u201d\n\n\u201cBankman-Fried has boasted of meeting policymakers in Washington \u201cevery two or three weeks for the last year.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2018Aid To Ukraine,\u2019 the US Democratic Party And The Collapse Of FTX (Livshitz)\n\nBankman-Fried is a very well-connected figure indeed in US politics. Over the course of the 2020 presidential election cycle, he contributed $5.2 million to two super PACs supporting Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, and was the overall second-largest individual donor to Biden that year. Such extravagant spending appears trivial today. In 2021/22, he provided tens of millions to Democratic causes and candidates, becoming the party\u2019s second-largest donor, behind only \u201cspyless coup\u201d specialist George Soros. Bankman-Fried has boasted of meeting policymakers in Washington \u201cevery two or three weeks for the last year.\u201d Over 2022, this has included multiple audiences with senior government officials and top Biden advisers at the White House. These meetings escalated in volume around the time that the Ukraine conflict began. On March 7, exactly one week before Aid for Ukraine was launched, his brother Gabe Bankman-Fried \u2013 who directs his political operations \u2013 visited the White House along with Jenna Narayanan, a Democratic strategist who once worked for the Democracy Alliance, which has been called the \u201cmost powerful liberal donor club\u201d in the US. Bankman-Fried himself then visited the White House on numerous occasions in April and May, concurrent with him donating $865,000 to the Democratic National Committee. In early June, mere days after his last recorded White House meet-and-greet, Bankman-Fried announced he would invest up to $1 billion in further funds between then and 2024 to guarantee Biden \u2013 or whoever might take his place \u2013 won the next presidential election. These activities have been interpreted by many as an attempt by Bankman-Fried to ingratiate himself with politicians to further his commercial interests. It is certainly true that, at the same time, he and FTX high-rankers were attempting to influence US lawmakers on crypto regulation, to make the market more favorable for his company. In this context, the promised $1 billion appears to be a dangled carrot, an implied promise of future financing if Bankman-Fried got his way. Accompanying him on some of these visits was Mark Wetjen, FTX head of policy and regulatory strategy, who previously served as commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama \u2013 but only some. Were the other meetings related to Ukraine? If so, the $1 billion pledge may have reflected what Bankman-Fried thought could be secretly skimmed from Aid for Ukraine for Democratic Party purposes. It\u2019s conspicuous that in mid-October, he completely disowned that enormous commitment, saying, \u201cThat was a dumb quote. I think my messaging was sloppy and inconsistent in some cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cBAHAMAS GOVT ORDERED BANKMAN-FRIED TO HACK FTX SYSTEM AND TRANSFER ASSETS TO THE BAHAMAS GOVT ACCOUNT: COURT FILING\u201d\n\nBAHAMAS SECURITIES REGULATOR SAYS IT ORDERED FTX CRYPTO WALLETS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO GOVERNMENT WALLETS\n\nSAM BANKMAN STOLE $300 MILLION OF THE $420 MILLION FTX RAISED FROM INVESTORS LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER. (WSJ)\n\nSBF\u2019s lawyers at Paul Weiss have dropped him as a client: \u201cWe informed Mr. Bankman-Fried several days ago, after the filing of the FTX bankruptcy, that conflicts have arisen that precluded us from representing him\u201d\n\u2022 FTX Boss Accused Of Using Offshore Funds After Bankruptcy (RT)\n\n\u201cThe clobber list also includes this curious item: \u201cThe strike has resulted in the neutralisation of the production capacities for nuclear weaponry.\u201d\n\nThe careful destruction of energy systems in Ukraine continues. From today\u2019s clobber list as provided by the Defense Ministry of Russia: \u201d On 17 November, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation launched a concentrated strike, using high-precision long-range air-, sea- and ground-based weapons, at the facilities of military control, defence industry, as well as related fuel and energy infrastructure of Ukraine. The goals of the strike have been reached. All the missiles have accurately stricken the assigned facilities.\u201d I have no idea if the last line is true but it does not matter much. The targeting of 330 kilovolt transformers in various switching stations has cut some 50% of the distribution capability of Ukraine\u2019s electricity network. These transformers weigh up to 200 tons. There are no replacements. You do not buy them at the next corner but will have order them with years of lead time. As far as I can tell Russia is currently Russia the only producer of transformers of that type. Isn\u2019t it a war crime to destroy the infrastructure that supplies civilians? It depends. If the infrastructure is used exclusively for civilian purpose the destruction is illegal. But the electricity and transport infrastructure in Ukraine is used for civilian AND military purposes. In a recent Politico piece Ukrainian officials are even confirming that: Ukraine tells allies it may not be able to recover from more Russian attacks on energy systems: \u201d An unreliable energy sector could have deadly consequences, Ukrainian officials say. In recent conversations, they\u2019ve added that it could halt food production and transport operations \u2014 critical services needed to support military operations.\u201d The clobber list also includes this curious item: \u201cThe strike has resulted in the neutralisation of the production capacities for nuclear weaponry.\u201d I wonder where and what that has been: \u201cOne depot of artillery armament, delivered by western countries and prepared for being sent to troops, has been destroyed. The redeployment of the reserve forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), and the delivery of foreign armament to operations areas have been frustrated.\u201d The last sentence describes the real purpose of the attacks on the energy systems. The lack of energy is degrading the railway network that brings weapons from the west to the eastern front. It makes redeployment of units from one front section to another very difficult and time consuming. It will give the Russian forces the advantage when they change the Schwerpunkt of their attacks from one corner of the frontline to another. Another effect of the strikes on the electricity systems and the blackouts in the big cities that follow them is a renewed stream of refugees that will want reach western Europe. It will over time change the public opinion and the political priorities of those countries. If they fail to end the war they will have to carry the burden.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times notes the continued emergency that the country\u2019s vital nuclear power plants are facing, given they themselves must rely on the national grid for aspects of their normal operations.\u201d\n\u2022 Ukraine Has Lost 40% Of Energy System As Kyiv Sees First Snow (ZH)\n\n\u201cWhat we want is an end to this war. Someone is trying not to end the war. The US sees the prolongation of the war as its interest.\u201d\n\u2022 Ukraine Is \u2018War Between West And Russia\u2019 \u2013 Turkish Official (RT)\n\nThe West is using Ukraine to wage a war against Russia and has gone so far as to sabotage Turkish diplomacy that sought to negotiate an end to it, the deputy leader of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s ruling AKP party, Numan Kurtulmus, told CNN Turk on Friday. \u201cThis war is not between Russia and Ukraine, it is a war between Russia and the West,\u201d Kurtulmus told the outlet, adding that \u201cthe US and some countries in Europe\u201d are prolonging the conflict by supporting Ukraine. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is talking to both Moscow and Kiev, said Kurtulmus, and in March managed to organize negotiations in Istanbul that looked promising. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Vladimir Zelensky, \u201cwere going to sign\u201d a deal, but \u201csomeone didn\u2019t want\u201d that to happen. According to Ukrainian media, Kiev received a message in April that the West was not interested in peace with Russia, which encouraged Zelensky to break off the talks. The messenger was reportedly none other than the UK prime minister at the time, Boris Johnson. \u201cThere was progress on certain issues, and we were reaching the final point, and then suddenly we saw that the war accelerated,\u201d Kurtulmus told CNN Turk on Friday. \u201cWhat we want is an end to this war. Someone is trying not to end the war. The US sees the prolongation of the war as its interest.\u201d In his opinion, the conflict has made much of Europe clamor for NATO to become more active against the perceived threat from Russia, which benefits Washington. According to Kurtulmus, the \u201cbalance of the world system disappeared\u201d with the demise of the Soviet Union, and a \u201cfierce power struggle\u201d is currently taking place. \u201cIt is essential to establish a global political system. It is necessary to establish new institutions that will ensure world peace,\u201d he said. Kurtulmus is a former Turkish deputy prime minister, who has been Erdogan\u2019s deputy at the head of AKP since 2018. His comments came as Russia agreed to extend the Turkish-negotiated deal for exporting grain through the Black Sea by 120 days, on the condition Kiev doesn\u2019t use the sea corridor to carry out more attacks.\n\nNo coincidence.

So if you put sanctions on at higher prices, in a way you\u2019re just making the situation worse.\u201d\n\nThis puzzles me: Garland said:\u201cBased on recent developments, including the former president\u2019s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election and the sitting president\u2019s stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel.\u201d\n\nSee? They\u2019re both candidates, but only one gets a special counsel. Where in his words is the logic? It\u2019s not as if there is no reason to probe Hunter.

One of the limits of his approach was that it was focused only on oil and gas. His models were sometimes oversimplified, and, at times, he would be too quick in disparaging new technologies that could change the picture. Perhaps his main limit was to have overemphasized the importance of the peak date as a turning point for humankind and to have believed that it could be determined by models. I know that he understood that the peak was just one point in a smooth curve, and he said that several times in public statements. But many people misunderstood the meaning of \u201cpeak oil\u201d and saw it as equivalent to \u201crunning out\u201d of oil. For some, it was the equivalent of the religious concept of apocalypse, and that led to accusations against ASPO of being a millenarian cult of some kind. It should go without saying that Colin\u2019s ideas were as far from millenarism as they could possibly have been. His approach was good, data-based science, and he was fond of quoting Keynes saying, \u201cwhen I have new data, I change my mind, what do you do, sir?\u201d (actually, Samuelson said that). Colin\u2019s capability of dispassionately analyzing data led him to avoid the mistakes that other members of ASPO made, such as putting all their hopes on nuclear energy or refusing to accept climate science as a valid scientific field. So, even though right now the concept of \u201cpeak oil\u201d seems to be out of fashion, good ideas are like souls. They move from one generation to another, being reborn as new incarnations if they are good. Campbell\u2019s ideas have that power, right now they are nearly forgotten, but waiting to reappear in a suitable body, like the spirit of the Dalai Lama. We, humans, forget things so easily, especially important things. But one day we\u2019ll understand Campbell\u2019s main message that what we get from the Earth may seem to be free, but it must be repaid, sooner or later. And the debt recovery agency employed by Gaia is ruthless and cannot be bribed using money.\n\nSupport the Automatic Earth in virustime with Paypal, Bitcoin and Patreon.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "vaccine passports Archives - The Automatic Earth", "url": "https://www.theautomaticearth.com/tag/vaccine-passports/", "site_name": "The Automatic Earth"}, "tags": ["Black Sea", "bitcoin", "outdoor transmission", "ECHR", "Oregon", "COVID", "DeSantis", "Malone", "myocarditis", "measles", "Pfizer", "UNESCO", "Publix", "Zelensky", "panic", "Snowden", "vaccine passports", "Guardian", "G20", "Cuomo", "VAERS", "lockdowns", "Trump", "pilots", "mandatory vaccination", "Texas", "peak oil", "Afghanistan", "Delta", "travel bubble", "NBA", "lawyer", "unapproved", "Omicron", "VanDenBossche", "genetic vaccines", "democracy", "proficient", "human rights", "Hunter Biden", "oil price cap", "airlines", "Russia", "Scott Atlas", "marines", "Clarence Thomas", "Wuhan lab", "FTX", "special counsel", "Assange", "SBF", "Bahamas", "India", "seroprevalence", "boosters", "Putin", "Warp Speed", "WHO", "Jim Rogers", "Ron Paul", "private debt", "Greenland", "adverse reactions", "bioethics", "Garland", "untested", "AstraZeneca", "vaccine rollout", "vaccines", "minimum wage", "Ukraine", "Olympics boycott", "3CLPro Inhibitor", "B3W"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Alex Jones responds to Elon <a href=\"https://t.co/HgL0G7bxSG\">pic.twitter.com/HgL0G7bxSG</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Luke Rudkowski (@Lukewearechange) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange/status/1593768439767699457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A few decades ago they tried to scare everybody with global cooling. <a href=\"https://t.co/hQFH2zvOEt\">pic.twitter.com/hQFH2zvOEt</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Wittgenstein (@backtolife_2023) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/backtolife_2023/status/1593557511667318785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8EVMSqbvzU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
