I\u2019m your host, Isaac Weishaupt. And today, we\u2019re going to talk about Idiocracy. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re doing a film analysis of the classic film for 2006. Mike judge\u2019s Idiocracy. We\u2019re going to talk about this dystopian comedy, and how it has slowly become a reality. As we examine the corporate oligarchy, takeovers of the government, society spiraling out into its base frequencies, and the false depictions of the Illuminati, new Atlantis. It\u2019s all gonna get covered today. And before we get into the film, a couple quick items of housekeeping. All right. One, you\u2019ll notice my voice is better. I finally shook out all that congestion. And we\u2019re ready to rock and roll folks, too. Did you hear me on tinfoil hat I had my 12th appearance. On tinfoil hat with Sam Tripoli and x g. And Johnny Woodard, we talked about the Wizard of Oz. And it\u2019s a great time, you got to listen to it. You can watch the full video interview on Sam tripoli.com. Right now, as we speak, it\u2019s out there. Three, I\u2019ve enabled Apple premium. That\u2019s right. If you\u2019re listening to the show on Apple podcast, which I know you are, I know it\u2019s like 90% of us out there.

And of course, I\u2019ve still got Patreon, I still got the VIP section, I still got the rock Finn, I\u2019m giving you another method of doing it. This one is the easiest one by far. If you\u2019re on Apple bog has just hit the button you\u2019re in. And I did a whole 10 minute show last week discussing it.

You know a lot of us liked that you like it when I call you a free feed loser. So I\u2019m gonna keep doing it. Because I think it\u2019s funny. Because I think it\u2019s funny. You know, I grew up watching 80s wrestling. And I was always drawn like a magnet to the bad guys. I loved him. Remember, when was it a million dollar man who\u2019s gonna pay that kid to dribble the basketball? He knocked it out of his hands. Great moment. Anyway. So those that\u2019s the housekeeping, look at that two minutes, and we\u2019re done. Moving on. Oh, and today, one item of warning today. Today\u2019s show usually I don\u2019t swear or have much swearing in the shows. Today we\u2019re going to have a lot of explicit content. explicit lyrics, because I\u2019m gonna play you clips from the movie. Very sexual in nature at times. Lots of swear words. So if you\u2019re if you don\u2019t want to hear that, this isn\u2019t the show for you. Moving on. Should you watch this movie before we do the analysis? Analysis of course. And I\u2019ll give you a fair warning that I\u2019ve given many people and I received this fair warning and it was accurate the first time you watch this, you\u2019re gonna think it\u2019s stupid. I didn\u2019t like it. The first time I watched it. I was like, This is dumb. My friend let me borrow it. Ironically, the same friend who let he read pilled me the same friend. Let me borrow David Ickes freedom rode on a bootleg VHS tape. So my red pill friend also gave me he was a Marine, right? So we got along talking about all kinds of stuff and making fun of people. And he knew he knew I had it me. So he read pilled me with David Icke and Idiocracy. And the first time I watched it, I thought, This is stupid. But then, and I made Josie watch it with me. And but then after, you know, a couple of days, it soaks into your brain. And you start, you start bringing up clips and quotes. And he talks to other people that have seen it. And then it\u2019s funny. Like, this is one of the funniest movies ever. So there you go. You should watch it. Not a big deal. If I ruin the plot for you. Who cares, right? It\u2019s just, it\u2019s a silly comedy, so you should watch it. You don\u2019t need to watch it before you listen to this. Oh, and before I forget, shout out to Sheryl. All right. She\u2019s my top supporter. She\u2019s my top G All right. She requested I do. You know, Cheryl has been on my team so long. And I She\u2019s got everything. She got every book, every shirt, as I don\u2019t know what else I can give you. I don\u2019t know what else I can give you, Cheryl. She said, I want to see a show about Idiocracy. And I said, Consider it done. And I\u2019ll be honest with you. At first, I wasn\u2019t sure that I could actually make a full analysis about this movie. But I thought, you know, I\u2019m gonna do it for Cheryl and I gave it a watch. And I thought, there\u2019s a ton here. There\u2019s a lot we could talk about. So we\u2019re gonna do it today. The movie is the perfect length. It\u2019s less than 90 minutes. It\u2019s 84 minutes, because he knew how to keep it moving. All right. Starring Luke Wilson, he plays Corporal Joe Bowers, aka not sure. Which will make sense when you watch the movie. This is of course, Owen Wilson\u2019s brother. The Wilson they\u2019re actually born to a television executive. So you know, go figure. They become actors. There\u2019s a trend of what do you call it? There\u2019s like a term for nepotism. Nepo babies or whatever. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re born into wealth or Hollywood, and you make it like, it\u2019s not a shock, right? Everything\u2019s been laid out for you. Well, Luke Wilson, in his personal life, had a relationship with Drew Barrymore. You recall she was a child actor. She was put onto drugs and partying from a very inappropriately young age. infamously addicted to coke by the age of 12. My Rudolph she\u2019s also in this, she plays Corporal Joe Bowers, Consort. She is a prostitute named Rita. She also was born into the entertainment industry. Her mother was a singer and her father was a composer. We also have Dax Shepard who plays Fredo Pentaho. He\u2019s, yeah, Dax Shepard, that guy, the armchair quarterback, podcast guy. That guy he\u2019s in this movie. His parents were not in entertainment, says he\u2019s from Detroit. His parents worked in the automotive industry. It\u2019s a real Jack and Diane story. All right. Actually, don\u2019t mind that separate. I\u2019ve actually listen to a couple of his podcasts. He\u2019s fine. Terry Crews is in this movie. He plays President Dwayne Elizondo, Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. He\u2019s also from Michigan. He\u2019s from Flint, Michigan. I had a friend in the military from Flint, Michigan. He was a white guy. And he\u2019s always taught me how hard Flint was. I had no idea. You know, I grew up in PEI. I\u2019ve never been to Michigan. And you know, he was one of only a handful of white people in Michigan. But yeah, Flint, Michigan and Terry Cruz\u2019s from there is a tough city. It\u2019s a tough city. I mean, and look at Terry Crews, right? This guy is amazing, right? He played in the NFL, from a greedy acity named Flint, Michigan. Flint, Michigan also where they\u2019re making them drink the poison water. But this guy, he was part of the metoo movement. Right? He accused this high level executive this. I think his name was Adam. I can\u2019t even pronounce it. vennett from metallic company. He accused him of sexually. misconduct, abuse, harassment, some that effect. When he was coming up in Hollywood. devout Christian, he said he had a bad porn addiction. Right. And, yeah, I don\u2019t know our specter occurs. And you know, I\u2019m a pro porn kind of guy. But that\u2019s not to say some people don\u2019t get addicted. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s like anything else. Right? alcohol, gambling. Some people are susceptible to it and that\u2019s a real shame. But yeah, Terry Crews shout out Terry Crews to Justin Long. He\u2019s in this he plays Dr. Dr. Lexus. He also was in a relationship with Drew Barrymore at one time. And last but definitely not least, the rapper Scarface from the ghetto boys. He\u2019s the pimp. He plays upgrade with two Ds for the double dose of tampin. Now this movie was created by Mike Judge. This is a guy that gave us Beavis and Butthead. And King of the Hill. Now king of the hill, had a character named Dale. I never actually watched king of the hill. But there was a character named Dale and he used this alias of rusty Shackleford\n\napparently, right And I see this rusty Shackleford all the time, usernames on people on my Patreon and commenters on Instagram and stuff like that. Even what\u2019s that guy\u2019s name? The McAfee guy, right? That he, he\u2019s allegedly, there was a guy taking drone footage of Epstein island on YouTube. Around the time the McAfee, John McAfee died. And people allege that that was him. And the username for that YouTube channel was rusty Shackleford. I spoke too soon about my voice being fine. It\u2019s better. It\u2019s, it\u2019s like 90%. Alright. But my dad gave us office space and Silicon Valley, as well, as well as Idiocracy. So interesting guy, right? He\u2019s done lots of films. And before he did films, he worked in Silicon Valley. And Wikipedia says he moved to Silicon Valley to join parallax graphics. They start a video card company with about 40 employees based in Santa Clara, California, disliking the company\u2019s culture and his colleagues. Oh, that was period disliking the company\u2019s culture and his colleagues. And the they quote him he said the people I met were like stepper Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something and I don\u2019t know what it was. Now, isn\u2019t that interesting? That\u2019s just like, we did the film analysis for Don\u2019t worry, darling. It makes me think about that, right. Stepford Wives, of course, written by our 11, the guy who wrote Rosemary\u2019s Baby. Now, Idiocracy is release in theatrical release is somewhat of a conspiracy as well. So let\u2019s talk about that for a brief second. I\u2019m gonna read you from Wikipedia, it says, judges third film Idiocracy, a dystopian comedy starring Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph was given a limited release the accurately by 20th Century Fox in September 2006. Two years after production, the film\u2019s original release day was intended to be on August 5 2005. According to Mike Judge, in April 2006. The trailer, a release date was set. For September 1 2006, the film was released without a trailer or substantial marketing campaign. The film was not screened for critics beforehand, as is usually done. Lack of concrete information from Fox led to speculation that the distributor may have actively attempted to keep the film from being seen by a large audience, while fulfilling our contractual obligation for theatrical release ahead of a DVD release. So why would they try to suppress this? Well, I think we\u2019ll find out right? They had spent two and a half million hours to make the film and it only brought in about a half a million dollars in the box offices. So total failure, but it would go on to have a very large cult following, as you will hear today. So without further ado, let\u2019s get in. And let\u2019s get into Idiocracy. Let\u2019s go. So at the beginning of the film, it shows it shows us a demonstration of the theory of Darwinism and evolution. And it goes through this pretty hilarious explanation of how Darwinism and the evolution of man is not working as intended. Take a listen.\n\nUnknown Speaker 13:49\n\n As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point, natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators within the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most and left the intelligence to become an endangered species.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 14:42\n\n Now, what\u2019s interesting is that they show us what the theory of evolution and the technocrats in the Illuminati subscribe to. And it of course shows us the new Atlantis and this is the world that these occult has wanted to bring back. This goes if you look At Manley P halls, secret destiny of America. If you look at Francis Bacon\u2019s new Atlantis, which new Atlantis this was a novel from the 1600s Francis Bacon wrote it about this island and it had this educational system this college, it was a state sponsored scientific institution and it was called Solomon\u2019s house. And they call it the eye of the kingdom and this utopia called New Atlantis, it uses science as the new priests. And science is here to decode and to conquer nature, that is referring to taking over for God. And this this book influenced the early Rosicrucians and all that. Now, if you go to Manley P Hall, secret destiny of America, he was calling for a universal global order of very much a you know, Alex Jones is always ranting raving about the globalist New World Order. That\u2019s one of the ideas where he gets this from I propose he wanted this universal Manley P Hall and the Freemasons, allegedly one of this universal New World Order. And in secret destiny, they call it the Platonic empire. I want to read to you from secret destiny of America, it is reasonably conceivable that in secrecy and anonymity, well ordered aid has been given to the struggle for human equity and justice that has been America\u2019s Destiny through the past into our present time, it is our duty and our privilege to contribute what we can to this universal plan, it will go on served by the unknowns, until the Platonic Empire is established on the earth, and the towers of the new Atlantis rise from the ruins of a materialistic and selfish world. Now, if you hear what he\u2019s saying, they\u2019re about materialism, a suggestion that materialism is evil, which is a very Gnostic idea, they think the material realm and God\u2019s earth. And our human bodies even are limiting the true nature, the capitalistic spark of men. But in the movie, let\u2019s get back to the Idiocracy in the movie era, they\u2019ll say they use the law to say, with no, no natural predators to thin the herd. Right? Well, that\u2019s a very Darwinian idea. And who subscribes to social Darwinism, the Church of Satan. That\u2019s right. They don\u2019t believe in turning the other cheek. They believe in a very capitalistic idea of, you\u2019re allowed to punch someone in the face if they do you wrong. Sona was introduced to different types of couples. One is Cleavon, with an IQ of 84. And he\u2019s got a ton of kids, then they got Trevor with an IQ of 135. Who\u2019s scared of the economy, too scared to have kids. Scared to put down on some sick driver scared to put down on some thick, that\u2019s what it is to worry about school and economics. But then they show the show Cleavon Jr. Who\u2019s the first child of kleavon. And his IQ is even less goes from 84 to 78. And he\u2019s busy, he\u2019s playing football, he\u2019s bagging all the cheerleaders. And oh, an interesting fun fact, his jersey number is actually 33. Right? Maybe a reference to the 33rd degree of Freemasonry, Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. So it\u2019s 2005. And in the basement of this army library, were introduced to private Joe Bowers, Luke Wilson. And he\u2019s been chosen for this human hibernation experiment with the idea that what they can do is, and they\u2019re and he\u2019s an idiot, right? They\u2019re just going to use him to experiment on because what they want to do is actually save their best pilots when they\u2019re in their prime for when they need them later down the road. So they choose Joe Bowers, for this experiment, because he\u2019s, as average as anyone could be is the perfectly average he is but he\u2019s no family. He\u2019s an only child. His parents are deceased, which would have made for a nice Disney plot, right. And so they choose him and they choose a prostitute named Rita, to undergo this experiment for hibernation. And Rita was a prize destitute. And her pimp is upgrade played by Scarface, of course. So these two, they go into hibernation, and they\u2019re under hibernation for a year. But while they\u2019re in hibernation, the officer, the military officer, who was under control, the program gets arrested because he started hanging out with upgrade. And he\u2019s a pimp and too, so he gets arrested for pimping. And no one realizes that these two are in these hibernation pods. So the one year turns into two and three, and four, and so on, right? So they\u2019re in these hibernation pods longer than expected. And they\u2019re in the future now. And we\u2019re not sure what year it is yet. It\u2019s 2505. We find out but they\u2019re in the future. And they\u2019re tearing down the, the, these army buildings because now it\u2019s you know, 500 years later. And they\u2019re tearing down the buildings. And you find out if you look closely, and I\u2019ll put the image on the Instagram or if you\u2019re watching the video version of the show. When they\u2019re 10 on the building, you see that it\u2019s the building number is also 33. Just a coincidence? I think not? I think not. So the narrator who walks us through the story, he talks about what happens to society. While these two are stuck in these hibernation pods, take a listen.\n\nUnknown Speaker 21:31\n\n Sooner after Collins arrest and the massive scandal that followed, the bass was closed. It hadn\u2019t even been a year, and the entire project was simply forgotten. Things looked bleak for Joe that they were even worse for mankind has Joe and Rita laid dormant the years past, and mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.\n\nUnknown Speaker 22:06\n\n Some had high hopes that genetic engineering would correct this trend in evolution. But sadly, the greatest minds and resources were focused on conquering hair loss and prolonging erections. Meanwhile, the population exploded. And intelligence continued to decline until humanity was incapable of solving even its most basic problems like garbage, which had been stacked for centuries with no plan whatsoever, leading to the great garbage avalanche of 2505 which would set in motion the events that would change the world forever.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 22:49\n\n So they\u2019re in the hibernation pods and the great garbage avalanche happens. And outcomes, these hibernation pods they bust open right now it\u2019s the year 2505. And the characters the society is full of morons, right? Doc Shepherd plays one of the morons. And they\u2019re doing dumb stuff like they\u2019re eating cheese from a bucket. They\u2019re watching shows on a thing called the violence network shows like all my balls, and it\u2019s just a guy getting kicked in the balls over and over again. Very much like jackass, actually, like jackass. But I\u2019m also a simpleton. All right, the future is going to be just fine for people like me. And they\u2019re eating at places. Because they lose the ability to spell over time. And Fuddruckers the restaurant, which I haven\u2019t seen one of those in forever. But anyway, Fuddruckers slowly morphs into but fuckers by the end, 500 years, right? And if you look, you can see different advertisements, right? And what was interesting to me was that they had an advertisement for Google. It said, Google my Google for $599 a day. Now, I was interesting, because Google back in 2005. I mean, they were a big company. Don\u2019t get me wrong, but certainly not the name they are today. Right. But everything you see in the future has corporate advertisements all over it. There\u2019s not an inch of wasted space, everything\u2019s gonna have corporate sponsorship. It\u2019s on the clothing. It\u2019s in the courtrooms. It\u2019s all over the hospitals. And this is the corporate takeover. This is exactly what they want. And that\u2019s how we do it in America. Right? Our healthcare system is a for profit system. It\u2019s not possible that you\u2019re going to see Carl\u2019s Jr. ads in the hospital. And we\u2019re going to talk about this morning to come in the conclusion. Because there\u2019s actual real conspiracies about corporate America preventing the release of this film. Why do you think they didn\u2019t want this out? Other, right? Because they want us eating buckets of cheese and watching the violence network while they rake in the dough. They was wearing a shirt to say Carl\u2019s Jr, all over it. So anyway, what\u2019s his name Luke Wilson\u2019s character? Bauer\u2019s private Joe Bowers. Right. He gets up. He\u2019s like, what? He has no idea what year it is or nothing, right? He just wakes up. He\u2019s like, what\u2019s, what\u2019s happening here, right? And he goes to a hospital named St God\u2019s Memorial Hospital. And everyone\u2019s giving them grief. They\u2019re saying he talks like and, and look, there\u2019s a word they use. Back in 2005. Out of out of respect, I will not say the word I\u2019ll spell it out. But they\u2019re say talks like an F A G. Because he doesn\u2019t have the the future dialect is a mixture of hillbilly and slang and he doesn\u2019t have that. Okay. So they make a joke out of how he talks like an F A G, all right. And in this hospital, they\u2019ve got slot machines, they\u2019ve got water fountains that don\u2019t provide water, they provide Bronto, which is like a Gatorade. It\u2019s a thirst mutilator with electrolytes. Which I remember watching this in 2005, how silly that seemed. And I mean, I\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019ll see I mean, shit, I buy electrolytes. A biome over drink has electrolytes in it now. So I mean, another another, another accuracy of the film. And the fun factor was actually a website bronto.com. And if you go there now, it takes you to Omni consumer products that I am pretty sure it\u2019s also a fake website that has various movie products like it has the Fight Club soap. I don\u2019t know if you can actually buy it or not. But I checked it out because I was curious. Anyway, so corporate Bowers goes to this hospital. And because he\u2019s like, he wants to get checked out. And he talks to Dr. Lexus. And this is a very funny clip, and I\u2019ll play it for you. But Dr. Justin Long plays Dr. Lexus. And you can hear that we\u2019ve incorporated some of these, some of these dialects. I do it myself. We all have valley girl slang. Instead of saying I think Bill Maher was making fun of this the other night. He said, You know when people talk nowadays, they say they don\u2019t say they don\u2019t want to tell the story. They\u2019re like, well, he said this and she said that they say, Well, he\u2019s all like this. And I\u2019m like that, like it\u2019s valuable sliders true. I do it all the time. I\u2019m not above it. But take a listen to this dialogue.\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:05\n\n Yeah, all right. Well, not so good. You know, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. But I\u2019m seeing things I think it might be because of these drugs the army put me on but if you could just get me well enough to get back to base\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:18\n\n right? To guess. Don\u2019t want to sound like a dick or nothing but says on your chart. You\u2019re fucked up. You talk like a fag and your shits all retarded? What I do is just say like,\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:38\n\n No, I\u2019m serious here.\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:41\n\n Don\u2019t worry. Sgro. Now there are plenty of targets out there living really kick ass lives. My first wife was targeted. She\u2019s a pilot. Now.\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:49\n\n I need for you to be serious for a second here. Okay, I need help.\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:53\n\n There\u2019s that fag talk we talked about. Right? So that\u2019ll be this many dollars. And if you could just go ahead and like put your tattoo in that shit.\n\nUnknown Speaker 29:04\n\n This thing has a sameness printers that magazine wanted the answer.\n\nUnknown Speaker 29:08\n\n Where\u2019s your tattoo tattoo? Why don\u2019t you have this?\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 29:14\n\n Now look, I\u2019m not gonna go over every single joke in this movie. I just there was a couple I wanted to pull out that are funny. That was one of them. All right now. So they find out that corporate Bowers doesn\u2019t have the tattoo, which is what they use for payment. They, they use a wrist tattoo for payment. And they freak out the common unscannable right. Back in the day, I remember. I remember. Tattoos were viewed as the mark of the beast. That one of my early formative moments as a child in the grocery store, I remember seeing one of those little pamphlets. There\u2019s a name for it. I forget it all the time. Paranoid American made a bunch of MK Ultra versions of these pamphlets. And I remember seeing about this market Nice talk. I\u2019ve actually heard a defense from a guy on Tik Tok. That made a lot of sense, right? And obviously, I\u2019m covered in tattoos. And of course, I want to believe that this is not gonna give me eternal damnation. But what do I know? Maybe, right. And this guy on Tiktok s Allah Tiktok, it must be true. References The Book of Leviticus 1928. And he claims and I\u2019m no theologian, I could be very wrong about this. He claims that this is the only scripture that says you shouldn\u2019t do tattoos in the Bible. And he says, If you want to look at, if you want to look at that whole Book of Leviticus, you\u2019ve got it tells you not to trim your beard, tells you to eat rare steak tells you don\u2019t cut the size of your hair. And Leviticus was written to the Levites. So even with all that in mind, as long as you\u2019re not a Leviticus priest, you\u2019re good. It turns out. And then in the book of Matthew, they asked, Jesus said, Jesus, what\u2019s the most important commandment? And he said, Love God, love people. That\u2019s it. Just that easy. Amen. Paper, it\u2019s easy. In reality, not so easy. In Corinthians, it\u2019s mentioned that something to that effect, that something about how everything on this Earth doesn\u2019t necessarily benefit you, right? So the idea is, okay, you can get a tattoo, but know that it\u2019s not necessarily going to make your life better, or be in your best benefit. So that\u2019s kind of where it lies. It\u2019s, it\u2019s one of those things, it\u2019s like, well, I mean, you can, you\u2019re not gonna go to burn in hell, but is putting on the right path towards God. And that\u2019s a subjective question. But the tattoo is the mark of the beast for payment is where it comes in, in this film, because the Mark of the Beast is needed to buy and sell a lot of people think it\u2019s going to be the cryptocurrencies via embedded chips in your hand. Or maybe a lot of people were worried that this was going to be the new vaccine card, right? Remember that. But either way, in the film, they find out he doesn\u2019t have this mark of the beast, and they\u2019re all freaking out. They\u2019re freaking out. They don\u2019t want to be near him. Because he\u2019s not fitting in to what society is demanding. He\u2019d be like. And in the movie, people they go to kiosks to order food. A kiosk is called Omni, bro. Which again, and I\u2019ll put that image on there, too. Again, that\u2019s happening right now, when you go to McDonald\u2019s, you go to the screen in order, right? This is happening. There\u2019s already an Omni, bro, at these fast food places. In this example, in the film, it\u2019s actually Carl\u2019s Jr. But you know, their slogan is called Jr. Fuck you. I\u2019m meeting. And what\u2019s ironic is that the, the CEO of Carl\u2019s Jr. was actually Trump Donald Trump\u2019s nomination for Secretary of Labor back in 2017. But the guy backed out. So Carl\u2019s Jr. in league with the government almost happened in 2017. So anyway, the cops that come and they arrest them, there was Joe Bowers for being an unscannable. And they sent him to trial at a courtroom, right. And they forced him to get the mark of the beast, they force him to get this tattoo. And the machine, he put his arm in the machine to get the tattoo. And they asked him his name. And he gets confused by what they\u2019re asking him. And he says, not sure now that now his name is trying to have a conversation with this AI machine. And he, and they scan him with a tattoo. They mark them. And now his name is not sure. Okay. And they sent him to prison. And he takes an IQ test while he\u2019s in prison. And he finds out that he\u2019s smart. He\u2019s really smart, compared to the mouth breathers that he\u2019s surrounded by. So he gets this idea. He\u2019s thinking he\u2019s starting to realize that he says, maybe I\u2019m smarter than everybody here. And maybe I can just walk right out of this prison. And so he walks up to the guards, he says, Look, I\u2019m supposed to leave right now in there and they say, okay, and he walks out, right? And this whole time he says, Look, I don\u2019t want to be in 2505 I gotta find this time machine. And he goes back to DAX, Shepard\u2019s character, Frito, pan de Hall, and Fredo says, hey, they got One of those time machines at Costco so he says we\u2019ll take me there so they, they they make it to Costco. There was no time machine. All right. But the cops pick him up again they take him to the White House, because now they realize he\u2019s the smartest human being on earth because that IQ test and here\u2019s where it meets the president, Terry Crews, Dwayne Elizondo Camacho, porn star wrestling the WWE SmackDown champ and President of the United States. And President Camacho says, Look, you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re the smartest human being, you\u2019re gonna fix this dust storm, you\u2019re gonna fix these dying crops. You\u2019re gonna fix the colony. As he puts it. He says he\u2019s going to do it all in one week. All right. And we find out that they\u2019ve been watering the crops with this Bronto this Gatorade? So not sure he\u2019s like, well done. What are you guys doing that for? And he finds out that the FDA Bronto lobbyists, the Bronto bought the FDA and the FCC so they could say and do whatever they want it including changing the food pyramid. Now that don\u2019t sound like a real conspiracy. I don\u2019t know what is right. Some real stuff is lobbyists revolving door which is to me the biggest problem they will back and forth government, military, the lobbyist lobbying for corporate America. So fixes the Dust Bowl. It fixes the plants by simply giving them water. All right, by undoing what the corporate oligarchy has managed to screw up. The problem happens though that Brando this, the stock drops to zero and everyone loses their jobs. It\u2019s not unemployment rates through the roof. So now they\u2019re mad at not sure. Again, this is okay. You screwed up again. Now you\u2019re getting punished. They sent into this Roman gladiator deathmatch that called Monday night rehabilitation. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s like the Running Man. Right? It\u2019s televised entertainment, of someone going through the punishment and possibly dying. And he\u2019s about to get killed. It\u2019s about to get torched by beef supreme. When, when all of a sudden, Fredo pendejo he puts up some footage on the main screen in the stadium there of the crops actually growing because of the water transition. So President Camacho he gives not sure a full pardon. saves him makes him a vice president. And all is good, right? He saves the world. And the movies over in the day new moi we find out that the time machine at Costco that freedom of thought was there was just a carousel ride. And it shows the world history. And not sure sort of accepts that now he\u2019s stuck in the future. There is no time machine he\u2019s done. And the UN is recognized as the ones to what they say on Nazi the world, right? On this on this time machine read. And in the future, not sure and Rita they end up having three kids. And they tell you that free open day has 32 kids. Again, very close to 33. Another 33 reference perhaps. And then if you watch the credits as opposed credits clip, you\u2019ve got upgrade the pimp. He wakes up in the future also. He\u2019s in a hibernation pod. And now he\u2019s in the mix. Presumably, he\u2019s gonna end up doing better than not sure. So in conclusion, Idiocracy this whole plot of social Darwinism going the wrong direction, is this possible? Well, from just an opinionated, casual offers,\n\nI gave the opposite observation of current society versus what Idiocracy showed us almost 20 years ago. 20 years ago, he was saying, Here\u2019s what the future is going to look like. People are, are vulgar. They\u2019re stupid. They\u2019re covered in tattoos. They\u2019re entertained by violence. Corporate America rules everything. Even the government. everyone\u2019s obsessed with sex and masturbation. I mean, in the in the future, you can get a handjob at Starbucks. So there\u2019s that right. It\u2019s the Roman bread and circus. So I think Mike Judge was looking at the past, to look at the future. And yes, there\u2019s a theory called dis Genex. Which is this idea that there\u2019s traits that we desire. And those traits that we, you know, to be more intelligent, more understanding, higher free ascending of the ladder of consciousness. They\u2019re called the ladder of Mithras, I believe. Ascending consciousness, like we talked about with Wizard of Oz. Did you catch my four episodes on Wizard of Oz yet? We\u2019ve talked about ascending consciousness. Well, there\u2019s an opposite of that descending consciousness dis Genex. And they say that over time, due to social pressures that disfavor, the reproduction of the quality traits. Things will go the wrong direction. So that intellectual couple, they\u2019re busy thinking about the economy. They\u2019re busy worried about having enough money to pay for this kid. They\u2019re, they\u2019re worried about the future world, they\u2019re worried about climate change. They\u2019re too worried davek Child meanwhile, Johnny Football he\u2019s, he\u2019s doubling the clip, he don\u2019t care. And I believe that YOLO is pushing us into this kind of attitude. You know, Johnny Football, he\u2019s actually having a much funner life than the intellectual guy. Intellectual guys, like, No, we got to get to college. Let\u2019s make some good investments. First, let\u2019s pay off the bills. He\u2019s holding back he\u2019s restraining Johnny Football is having a great time. Johnny Football is posting it all over social media. And others are gonna see and they\u2019re saying I want to live Johnny footballs life too. Because social media paints a false picture of reality, people end up chasing it. Everybody\u2019s an entrepreneur. Right. And there\u2019s a book by Richard Lynn called dis Genex genetic deterioration in modern populations, right. And he wrote it back in 96. And his concerns. When I read I didn\u2019t read the whole book. Obviously, I could barely read the title. says Richard Lynn lists three concerns. deterioration in health, intelligence and consciousness. No conscientiousness, excuse me. Lien claims that unlike modern societies, natural selection in pre industrial societies, favor traits such as intelligence and character. So when you read all these occult philosophers, it makes me think, you know, over 100 years ago, when a lot of these occultus were around, maybe there were higher orders of thinking back then. Because it was the modern philosophers. Now we\u2019ve got, like, Jordan Peterson, we\u2019ve got Sam Harris. I mean, are all the vet seems like back in the day, everybody was a philosopher, as always big names, right? We still talk about Plato. All these philosophers being suppressed? Or do they not exist? Or is it just too heavy and no one wants to look at it. No one wants to think about this stuff. Or, you know, maybe there\u2019s not on my radar, because I\u2019m not in that that world. But it just seemed to me, it seems, again, casual observation seems that maybe it was more prevalent 100 plus years ago, to talk about philosophies and higher order ideas. But it\u2019s also possible I\u2019m totally wrong with that. But anyway, because I\u2019m sure back then there was no dummies. Working the farm that had no clue what the Renaissance thought leaders were up to. And just for fun, I thought, Alright, let\u2019s do a little comparison. Comparison here on this theory of who\u2019s having all the children. Okay. Nick Cannon has 12 kids. Jordan Peterson has to Sam Harris toolkits Joe Rogan. Two kids. Neil deGrasse Tyson, two kids. So those four I\u2019d say pretty intellectual folks. As far as you know, and I\u2019m not saying Oh, I love you guys, Tyson. Like, I don\u2019t really like him. But I mean, those are four kind of thought leaders of modern society. Those four even together have less than Nick, Nick Cannon. Right. So, so, again, casual observations and opinions here. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. And if you look at I watched a lot of cyberpunk movies recently, this shows this patina Until future this is called high tech, low life, you know, the technology keeps increasing, but our lifestyles decrease over time. Now, there\u2019s actually one interesting thing. We\u2019re gonna wrap it up here soon. Mike Judge considered the name of the film, to be 3001. And that\u2019s actually what Arthur C Clarke wrote a book, The last book in the the Odyssey sequels. Was 3000 won the final Odyssey. Which I found that to be interesting. Now, of course, Arthur C. Clarke released that book prior to my judges movie. So I don\u2019t know if he did that, to emulate it or what, because in 3001, I read all those books, I highly recommend them. 3001 They, they show the final plan for humanity is evolving us into digital consciousness, getting rid of the human form, and abandoning this evil material realm, going out into the space. But anyway, let\u2019s look at why they kept delaying the film, right, because Wikipedia reports that there were multiple outlets saying it was intended to be delayed indefinitely. They didn\u2019t even want to release this film. Why, though, right. That\u2019s why there was no screenings. That\u2019s why there was no press kits. There was no trailers, there was no advertisements for this movie. In New York Times claimed that maybe fox didn\u2019t want to offend the audience or offend advertisers, you know, because the advertising plays such a prominent role in this film. But I think it\u2019s because too close to the reality of what they want a corporate takeover. That Terry Crews, he said, I\u2019m gonna read different Terry Crews, he said, The rumor was because we use real corporations in our comedy. I mean, Starbucks was giving hand jobs. The, these companies gave us their name, thinking they were gonna get pumped up. And then we\u2019re like, welcome to Costco. We love you. All these real corporations. We\u2019re like, wait a minute, wait a minute. There were a lot of people trying to back out, but it was too late. And so Fox who own the movie decided, we\u2019re going to release this in as few theaters as legally possible. So it got really a release in probably three theaters over one weekend. And it was sucked out into the vortex. So yes, it was suppressed. Corporate America suppressed this thing. Because that\u2019s the truth is that we live in this oligarchy state, the corporate takeover. And it\u2019s like I always say, it\u2019s not necessarily the government that controls us. It\u2019s the corporations who have infiltrated and influence the government through lobbyists. The root cause of our issues, I believe, are mostly from corporate America. And one last one last item approved, Donald Trump was also a wrestler, and slept with a porn star, which is close to being a porn star. And he became the president. And Mike Judge, they actually asked him about this when it happened in 2016, or whatever. He said, I\u2019m no prophet. I was off by 490 years. So there you go. And then good in double conclusion, Idiocracy. It\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s actually happening. So there you go. Hope you enjoyed that film analysis. Thank you again, Cheryl. For that, that idea. That was a good one. Hope you enjoyed it. And again, if you want support the show, you know where to go. Everyone sign up, they\u2019re gonna add free there to unlock and all the bonus episodes, you should join them patreon.com/illuminati watcher, or now on the Apple premium podcast app, you can just double click and you\u2019re good you\u2019re in.
