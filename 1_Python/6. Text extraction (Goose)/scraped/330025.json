This was revealed by Jean-Marc Sabatier* as early as December 2021.\n\nThe Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des m\u00e9dicaments (ANSM) pharmacovigilance investigation of vaccine side effects, published on October 28, 2022, establishes a direct link between Pfizer and Moderna vaccination and severe menstrual cycle disorders.\n\n \u201cThe dissemination of the guide to help report severe menstrual cycle disorders in July 2022 led to new pharmacovigilance reports,\u201d writes the ANSM. Between July and September 2022, 2952 cases of menstrual disorders were reported with Comirnaty vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech), and 515 with Spikevax vaccine (Moderna).\u201d\n\nAdverse effects according to the vaccine\n\nThe ANSM summarizes the side effects of vaccines used in France against Covid-19.\n\nThe analysis of adverse events reported with Comirnaty vaccine covers validated data from 9/30/2022 to 10/2022.\n\n Since the start of vaccination, 121,402 cases of adverse events have been analyzed by the reporting Regional Pharmacovigilance Committees (Bordeaux, Marseille, Strasbourg and Toulouse). The majority of adverse events are expected and not serious. In total, more than 117,434,300 injections have been performed as of October 20, 2022.\n\nThe analysis of adverse events reported with Spikevax vaccine covers validated data from 9/30/2022 to 10/2022\n\nSince the start of vaccination with Spikevax (Moderna) vaccine, 31,895 cases of adverse events have been analyzed by the reporting CRPVs (Lille and Besan\u00e7on). A large number of cases concerned local delayed reactions that were not serious. Since November 8, 2021, the use of Spikevax vaccine has been restricted to individuals aged 30 years and older. In total, more than 23,985,500 injections have been given as of October 20, 2022.\n\nSince the start of vaccination with Vaxzevria vaccine, 31,094 cases of adverse events have been analyzed by the reporting CRPVs (Amiens and Rouen). The vast majority of these cases involved flu-like syndromes, often of high intensity (high fever, body aches, headache). In total, more than 7,861,900 injections have been given as of October 20, 2022.\n\n Note: Vaxzevria vaccine is no longer recommended as part of the vaccine strategy and is no longer used.\n\nSince the start of vaccination with Jcovden vaccine (Janssen), a total of 1,700 cases have been analyzed by the reporting CRPVs (Lyon and Grenoble). The majority of adverse events were non-serious, expected, and had a favorable outcome, in particular reactogenicity events (e.g., malaise). Vaccination with Jcovden vaccine (Janssen) began in France on April 24, 2021, in people over 55 years of age. In total, more than 1,089,700 injections have been given as of October 20, 2022.\n\nAs Jcovden vaccine is no longer recommended in the vaccination strategy except in certain specific cases, this vaccine is now used very little.\n\nVaccination with Nuvaxovid vaccine began in France on March 1, 2022. In total, more than 33,100 injections have been performed as of October 20, 2022. A total of 80 cases were analyzed by the reporting CRPVs (Lyon and Grenoble). The majority of adverse events were non-serious.\n\nMore than 150,404,700 injections have been performed in France as of 20/10/2022\n\u2022 More than 117,434,300 injections with COMIRNATY (BioNTech-Pfizer)\n\u2022 More than 23,985,500 injections with SPIKEVAX (Moderna)\n\u2022 More than 1,089,700 injections with JCOVDEN (Janssen)\n\nNote: The adverse effects of vaccines in women were demonstrated as early as December 2021 by Jean-Marc Sabatier (article below).\n\n*Jean-Marc Sabatier, Director of Research at the CNRS and Doctor in Cell Biology and Microbiology, HDR in Biochemistry.
