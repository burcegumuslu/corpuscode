The carrot is no longer going to work\u2026\u201d Although Carlson did not identify the executive by name, the Washington bureau is currently headed by CNN\u2019s senior vice president, Sam Feist.\n\nThis commentary would have been shielded from the public if the executive in question did not accidentally send it to popular activist and commentator, Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe network confirmed the authenticity of the email; however, they insisted that there was nothing newsworthy about the contents.\n\nCNN wrote in a statement: \u201cThe email, mistakenly sent to Kirk, was simply acknowledging that current vaccination incentives are losing steam.\u201d Kirk and Carlson discussed the email in the latter\u2019s program. Carlson asked, \u201cIs it CNN\u2019s stated position now that they\u2019re going to try to administer medicine under the threat of punishment?\u201d\n\nReferring to the \u201ccarrot vs. stick\u201d analogy used in the email, Kirk then responded: \u201cWhat does the stick look like in CNN\u2019s world?\u201d CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter reacted to the segment, saying that Carlson twisted the email to push an \u201coutright lie\u201d about the network.\n\nHe said on his Twitter account, \u201cCNN has 4,000 staffers. One exec sends an email about vaccine hostility opining that \u2018the carrot is no longer going to work.\u2019 Carlson obtains it. And his show turns it into an outright lie: \u2018CNN WANTS TO USE A \u2018STICK\u2019 ON THE UNVACCINATED.'\u201d (Related: Fauci tells CNN he thinks there \u201cshould be more\u201d local COVID-19 vaccine mandates.)\n\nKirk has a long history of sharing his COVID-19 vaccine skepticism. He speculated on his podcast that twice as many people have died after getting the COVID-19 vaccine than those who have died from the disease itself.\n\nCiting numbers from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) a database on vaccine adverse events, Kirk took the number of deaths in the system. He said they may only account for one percent of total vaccine deaths, coming up with a total of 1.2 million deaths.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s true. I\u2019m saying that according to how we calculate VAERS by the independent study that was administered, this could be true,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking about the abovementioned email, Carlson shared, \u201cAs a channel, CNN should not have a position on whether you should take medicine or not, because it\u2019s a news channel. It\u2019s not a health station.\u201d\n\nKirk also took the opportunity to blast conservatives who advocated for vaccines during a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. \u201cThe other question is why all of a sudden in the last 48 hours has there been this almost coordinated effort of people on the establishment center-right kind of virtue signaling and telling every single person to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Carlson criticized CNN\u2019s executives for thinking that vaccination requirements may be necessary for businesses and schools while Fox Corporation recently implemented a vaccine passport system for its employees. Over the past few days, Fox News anchors and personalities also made an effort to encourage viewers to get vaccinated, while the network\u2019s news shows shared on-air graphics urging its audience to visit the federal government vaccine website.\n\nThis came as daily COVID cases have risen in the U.S., with the highly transmissible Delta variant now being the dominant strain, prompting some states to reimpose their mask mandates.\n\nFind more COVID-19 news and updates on Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Leaked CNN email hints at move toward more forceful vaccination measures", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2021-07-27-leaked-cnn-email-vaccination-measures.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson showed a screengrab from a CNN executive hinting that there is a need to use forceful measures to increase COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S. The email\u2019s subject line read: \u201cFW: #NEWS: A majority of unvaccinated Americans say they\u2019re unlikely to get the COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of outreach efforts.\u201d Carlson identified [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/392/2021/07/APPROVED-CNN-logo.png"}, "tags": ["corporate medical fascism", "pandemic", "covid-19", "immunization", "CNN", "Charlie Kirk", "fox news", "Medical Tyranny", "coronavirus", "Tucker Carlson", "vaccination"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.wakingtimes.com/the-carrot-is-no-longer-going-to-work-leaked-cnn-email-hints-at-more-forceful-measures-for-vaccines/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-07-14-fauci-wants-more-covid-vaccine-mandates.html", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carslon-nods-along-as-charlie-kirk-blasts-virtue-signaling-from-vaccine-promoting-conservatives", "http://pandemic.news", "https://www.wakingtimes.com/the-carrot-is-no-longer-going-to-work-leaked-cnn-email-hints-at-more-forceful-measures-for-vaccines/", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carslon-nods-along-as-charlie-kirk-blasts-virtue-signaling-from-vaccine-promoting-conservatives"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
