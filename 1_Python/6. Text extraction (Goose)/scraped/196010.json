In fact, what followed has been decades of nuclear proliferation, the spread of nuclear power plants and the escalation of the arms race with new higher tech weaponry.\n\nAs Hiroshima becomes yesterday\u2019s distant memory and Fukishima the current threat, the full extent of the casualties and body count are not yet in, partly because the Japanese government and the power companies don\u2019t want to alarm the public.\n\nYears earlier, a similar cover-up was in effect at Thee Mile Island complex in Pennsylvania where reports of the damage people suffered from a serious accident was minimized, never examined in depth by some of the very same media outlets who are today criticizing Japan for a lack of transparency.\n\nOn August, 6, 2008, the anniversary of the dropping of the first nuclear bomb, Alternet.org reported that the government and media were complicit in minimizing public awareness of the extensive suffering that did take place:\n\nWas this just accidental or is there a deeper pattern of denial? The great expert on psycho history, Robert J. Lifton, wrote a book, Hiroshima In America, with journalist Greg Mitchell about the aftermath of Hiroshima in America exploring what they call \u201c50 years of denial.\u201d\n\nLifton and Mitchell are evidence-based writers, not conspiratologists, but they could find no other explanation for how such a seminal event could have been distorted and misrepresented for a half century.\n\nNuclear power and nuclear weapons have been sold to the public relentlessly, in the first instance as necessary, and the second, as safe. Rory O\u2019 Connor and Richard Bell coined the term \u201cNuke Speak\u201d to describe the Orwellian methods deployed by the nuclear industry\u2019s PR offensive in a book length analysis of a well funded campaign that continues to this day using euphemistic language to mask its real agenda.\n\nAnd today, as the world watches the dreadful and even Darwinian struggle for survival by the earthquake and tsunami victims in Japan, as information about the extent of the nuclear danger trickles out, President Obama has reaffirmed his commitment to build new nuclear plants.\n\nOthers stress more parochial concerns. The TV production community fears a shortage in Japanese made magnetic and recording tape. Consumers are being told that they may face a delay in ordering new iPads so get your orders in now. And, the Israeli new service YNET says people there worry about a sushi shortage.\n\nMeanwhile, in Germany, more than 50,000 activists took to the streets in protest, but, so far, there has been no organized outcry here in the U.S. At the Left Forum in New York, the issue was barely addressed in the opening plenary.\n\nOn the right, flamboyant talking head/provocateur Ann Coulter defended the imagined health benefits of a release of radiation to counter what she calls the alarmism of the environmentalists. She calls it a \u201ccancer vaccine.\u201d\n\nIn a talk during a recent visit to Iran, which insists it is not making nuclear weapons, I raised questions about what their government said they want to do: expand their nuclear power plants. When I questioned the wisdom of that approach, I was jeered because they felt I was challenging their \u201cright\u201d to have what other countries have, their right to \u201cprogress.\u201d The thought that the plants could be dangerous was dismissed,\n\nWhat they don\u2019t seem to know and what millions in Japan are finding out is this technology\u2014with spent rods that are never \u201cspent\u201d and the nuclear waste that will outlive us all\u2013 is inherently unsafe. Jonathan Schell makes this point well in a recent essay in the Nation:\n\n\u201cThe chain of events at the reactors now running out of control provides a case history of the underlying mismatch between human nature and the force we imagine we can control. Nuclear power is a complex, high technology. But the things that endemically malfunction are of a humble kind.\n\nThe art of nuclear power is to boil water with the incredible heat generated by a nuclear chain reaction. But such temperatures necessitate continuous cooling. Cooling requires pumps. Pumps require conventional power. These are the things that habitually go wrong\u2014and have gone wrong in Japan. A backup generator shuts down. A battery runs out. The pump grinds to a halt. You might suppose that it is easy to pump water into a big container, and that is usually true, but the best-laid plans go awry from time to time. Sometimes the problem is a tsunami, and sometimes it is an operator asleep at the switch.\u201d\n\nAs the \u201cincident\u201d records of our own Nuclear Regulatory Agency make clear, these are not just Japanese problems. The Christian Science Minitor reports, \u201cThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission failed to resolve known safety problems, leading to 14 \u2018near-misses\u2019 in US nuclear power plants in 2009 and 2010, according to a new report from a nuclear watchdog group.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t even know the full of the extent of the accidents, unintentional releases of radiation and other problems in this country much less in others with fewer rules and less oversight. No one expected Chenobyl to explode, claiming so many lives; no one knows where the next disaster will occur.\n\nBernie Sandeers is calling for a full investigation of nuclear safety here. Ralph Nader writes,\n\nThe global nuclear roulette game goes on. Even moderate and restrained criticisms are dismissed until there is an \u201cevent\u201d that cannot be denied. Nuclear energy supporters promise that \u201cGen 4,\u201d the next generation of reactors, will be much safer.\n\nProblem solved? Not everyone thinks so. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists carries an assessment by Hugh Gusterson on \u201cThe Lessons of Fukishima.\u201d\n\nWe are still debating if nuclear power is worth the risk as irradiated clouds float over Los Angeles and there is a panicked run in the public to buy iodine pills. The industry\u2019s marketing machine is in crisis response mode and hasn\u2019t missed a beat, while many of us look on with a sense of impotence as we are told, once again, what\u2019s in our best interest.\n\nFormer presidential candidate and longtime consumer advocate and nuclear critic Ralph Nader strongly advocates phasing out nuclear power in the United States by calling for public hearings on the status of every single nuclear power plant in an interview with Democracy Now!
