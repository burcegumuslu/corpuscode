Even though heart attacks and other cardiac issues are exceptionally rare in children \u2013 and especially those that require rapid electrical stimulation \u2013 UK officials recognize the need for more defibrillators.\n\nDr. Suneel Dhand explains more about what is going on in a video you can watch at the RAIR Foundation website.\n\nLast July, The Guardian reported that the move came after Department of Education (DoE) officials met with campaigners, including Mark King, whose 12-year-old son Oliver suffered a sudden cardiac arrest incident while competing in a swimming race.\n\nThat report does not mention covid jabs (of course), but it does suggest that there is a growing and urgent need to have more defibrillators at children\u2019s schools \u2013 obviously because of the injections and what they are doing to people. (Related: This is why Sweden, Denmark, and several other European countries banned the Moderna injections for young people \u2013 because they destroy people\u2019s hearts.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a staggering number of defibrillators \u2013 20,000 defibrillators,\u201d Dhand states in the above-linked video. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure many other countries may follow suit.\u201d\n\nPrior to covid injections, children suffering or dying suddenly from cardiac events was extremely rare\n\nWhile it is certainly never a bad thing to prepare for medical emergencies in this manner, the fact of the matter is that this is odd timing if covid injections are somehow not the impetus behind the move.\n\nWhy is it suddenly urgent to get defibrillators into all UK schools before the end of the year, especially since King\u2019s son Oliver suffered his cardiac incident in 2011.\n\nUK officials have obviously been working on this plan for a while \u2013 or so they are making it seem. If Oliver had a heart attack 12 years ago, why is it suddenly a top priority now in 2023 to get tens of thousands of defibrillators into all UK children\u2019s schools?\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, it would have been absolutely unthinkable \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of when I was in primary school, when I was in grammar school \u2013 the thought never even entered our collective minds that we would even request defibrillators,\u201d Dhand says about the idea of needing defibrillators to treat lots of children for cardiac events that almost always and exclusively affect older people.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t really heard of young children dying suddenly. Of course, it\u2019s something that has happened ever since humans have existed, but it was really, really rare \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have even entered our minds to think about it.\u201d\n\nDhand is right: prior to Operation Warp Speed, how many children did you hear about who suffered a heart attack out of nowhere or dropped dead while going about normal activities? Now, we hear of at least a few new cases almost daily as if it is perfectly normal.\n\nDhand says he is working hard right now to unearth any and all data on statistics of sudden cardiac arrest or death in children to see if there has, in fact, been an uptick ever since Donald \u201cfather of the vaccine\u201d Trump unleashed these things as part of a global military operation.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget who pays for all those defibrillators,\u201d wrote a commenter about the situation. \u201cThe government caused the problem \u2013 first with covid, then the vaxx \u2013 and now they extort the people to pay for the fix, too. All the while, the money changes hands and the people at the top get their cut.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about covid \u201cvaccines\u201d can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Rising rates of sudden death among youth prompt UK children\u2019s schools to install thousands of defibrillators", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2023-01-30-heart-disease-sudden-death-youth-schools-defibrillators.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "By the end of 2023, nearly 18,000 schools across the United Kingdom will be furnished with more than 20,000 defibrillators to address escalating rates of heart disease in children \u2013 all thanks to covid \u201cvaccines.\u201d All state-funded schools across England, we are told, have defibrillators on the way.
