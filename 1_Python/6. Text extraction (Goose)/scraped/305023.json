Banned by the government. Wow.\u201d\n\nIcke had been set to feature at an event called Together for the Netherlands, but far-left activist groups complained to the government and demanded he be barred from entering the country.\n\nThe municipality of Amsterdam also asked the Dutch IND (Immigration and Naturalisation Service) \u201cto investigate whether Icke can be refused entry to the country,\u201d an appeal that was apparently successful.\n\nThe municipality complained that Icke had made \u201canti-Semitic statements in the past that are unacceptable and deeply hurtful,\u201d although it didn\u2019t cite any specific examples.\n\nThe same authority even asked that if Icke had been allowed into the country, his speech at the event \u201cbe closely monitored by the Public Prosecutor to assess whether criminal statements are being made.\u201d\n\nQuestions about the event were also asked in the Dutch parliament.\n\nIt remains to be seen what justification Dutch authorities actually used to ban Icke from speaking in the country, and why the ban also reportedly applies across the entire European Union.\n\nIcke was previously deplatformed by multiple Big Tech platforms for opposing lockdown and vaccine mandates.\n\nSome respodents to the news asserted that Icke had been banned for being outspoken against former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his role within the World Economic Forum.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Conspiracy Author David Icke Banned From EU, Labeled a \u201cTerrorist\u201d", "url": "https://TheRundownLive.com/conspiracy-author-david-icke-banned-from-eu-labeled-a-terrorist/", "description": "Censorship has now expanded from being unpersoned online to being banned from an entire countries as authoritarians continue to crack down on free speech. \u00a0 BY PAUL JOSEPH WATSON | SUMMIT NEWS\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-11-08T18:30:31+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-08T06:03:25+00:00", "site_name": "The Rundown Live", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/TheRundownLive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/David-Icke-Banned.jpg?fit=750%2C500&ssl=1", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "500", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["kristan t harris", "the rundown live", "kristan harris", "rundown live", "don via jr"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Received an email from the Dutch.
