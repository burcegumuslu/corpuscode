But if you\u2019ve got a cold\u2014or what feels like one, anyway\u2014should you get the COVID-19 vaccine? Or stay at home and reschedule?\n\nSo far, nearly three-quarters of all Americans have received at least one dose of the three available COVID-19 vaccines, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ); over 71 million have gotten a booster. But as cold and flu season crests, it\u2019s not always possible to secure an appointment when you\u2019re feeling your best.\n\nTo make matters more confusing, you might not be able to tell if you\u2019re dealing with , , or , especially as all three surge and access to testing remains limited. So, can you get the COVID-19 vaccine or booster if you\u2019re sick? Here\u2019s what infectious disease doctors say.\n\nCan you get the COVID-19 vaccine if you have a cold?\n\n\u201cPeople with mild illnesses can be vaccinated,\u201d the CDC in its COVID-19 vaccination checklist. (This includes the common cold or an upper respiratory infection, not a \u201cmild\u201d case of COVID-19.) If you\u2019ve got the sniffles, a sore throat, or a headache, you can go ahead with your appointment if you feel up to it\u2014just make sure you\u2019re wearing a mask and taking precautions to protect the people around you.\n\nAlthough there is no evidence that acute illnesses, like the flu, reduce COVID-19 vaccine efficacy or increase adverse reactions, people who feel moderately or severely sick should delay vaccination out of an abundance of caution, the CDC warns. Once you\u2019re feeling better, you can get the vaccine.\n\nIf you\u2019re having upper respiratory symptoms, there\u2019s a chance that your \u201ccold\u201d could actually be , says infectious disease expert , senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, so if your symptoms are more moderate or severe, it\u2019s not a bad idea to get tested or wait to get vaccinated until you feel better.\n\n, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agrees. \u201cIn the current environment where there\u2019s so much COVID-19 still being spread, wait until your illness has resolved, just to be safe,\u201d he advises.\n\nIn addition to preventing the spread of COVID-19, you\u2019ll also be doing yourself a favor: \u201cIf you have a stuffy nose and are feeling crummy, the vaccine could make you feel even crummier,\u201d Dr. Schaffner explains. Common of the vaccines include fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle aches\u2014not exactly a welcome addition to your existing cold symptoms.\n\nCan you get the COVID-19 vaccine if you have COVID-19?\n\nIf you know you have COVID-19 and are experiencing symptoms, you should not get vaccinated while you\u2019re sick, the CDC . Symptomatic patients should wait until their symptoms have subsided and they are cleared to leave isolation, while asymptomatic people should ensure they are allowed to before rolling up their sleeves.\n\nThis recommendation also applies if you happen to get COVID-19 before your second shot in your primary series of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. (This is still possible since you haven\u2019t been without the full series.) You\u2019ll want to wait until you\u2019ve recovered to get your next shot.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s a chance that you have COVID-19, it\u2019s best to get tested before heading to your vaccine appointment. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you coming in and infecting other people,\u201d says , an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the State University of New York at Buffalo.\n\nCan you get the booster if you\u2019re sick?\n\nSimilar rules apply to the COVID-19 boosters: If you\u2019re experiencing mild symptoms of another illness, you can go ahead with your shot, per the . But those battling more intense infections or SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) should reschedule their appointments.\n\nThere are enough available doses for everyone, but vaccine and booster appointments can still be tricky to book when everyone is booking appointments at once. When you\u2019re feeling under the weather and think you should reschedule your appointment, you should seek out COVID-19 testing, explains , an infectious disease specialist and a professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University.\n\nIn general, though, the experts say it\u2019s really best to put off your vaccine appointment if you have cold-like symptoms\u2014as long as you don\u2019t forget to reschedule your appointment. \u201cWe often say that a dose deferred is a dose never received,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. \u201cDon\u2019t let that happen to you.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
