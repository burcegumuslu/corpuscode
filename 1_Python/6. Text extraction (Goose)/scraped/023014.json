Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people.\u201d\n\nThe declaration states, in simple terms, that the effects of Covid-19 lockdown measures are devastating and doing irreparable damage, with disproportionate harm to the disadvantaged. The authors suggest, instead, \u201cThe most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the City of Great Barrington distanced itself in a public statement, claiming the GBD \u201ccreated harmful misperceptions\u201d about the city, \u201cjust as we are doing all we can to protect residents, employees, and visitors.\u201d\n\nThe declaration suggests that, as scientists have achieved a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact, they have found that \u201cvulnerability to death from Covid-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, Covid-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza.\u201d Thus, the GBD calls for life to be allowed to return to normal for individuals who are less vulnerable. This includes children resuming in-person learning and pre-Covid-19 extracurricular activities such as sporting events, music concerts, and art exhibits; young adults should return to an on-site work environment rather than working from home. The declaration does sensibly indicate that hygiene measures such as \u201chand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold.\u201d\n\nHerd immunity is a term that has been thrown around, often incorrectly, since the beginning of this pandemic, most notably in referring to Sweden\u2019s refusal to lock down the country and its economy. Merriam-Webster\u2019s definition is: \u201ca reduction in the risk of infection with a specific communicable disease (such as measles or influenza) that occurs when a significant proportion of the population has become immune to infection (as because of previous exposure or vaccination) so that susceptible individuals are much less likely to come in contact with infected individuals.\u201d The GBD authors define herd immunity simply as \u201cthe point at which the rate of new infections is stable\u201d and say that reaching this point \u201ccan be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine.\u201d\n\nResponse to the GBD has been mixed and, in some cases, extreme. The Guardian quotes a Yale epidemiologist, who declared the declaration\u2019s \u201cgrotesque\u201d approach would be a \u201cculling of the sick and elderly.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Assistant Editor James Freeman, on the other hand, devoted a column to asking why the media\u2019s not reporting more on this widely supported position. The American Council on Science and Health is praising the document\u2019s authors for suggesting \u201ctrying something new\u201d since \u201cour current on-again, off-again approach to containment isn\u2019t working as intended.\u201d\n\nOne day after the declaration was published, the GBD authors met with two top White House appointees, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and Covid-19 Task Force advisor Scott Atlas. Afterwards, Azar tweeted, \u201cIn the conversation . . . we heard strong reinforcement of the Trump administration\u2019s strategy of aggressively protecting the vulnerable while opening schools and the workplace.\u201d\n\nTo summarize, the Trump administration\u2019s approach to quelling the virus is to achieve herd immunity, with or without the vaccine, which some believe is in itself a problem. The effectiveness of herd immunity depends on whether or not having had the virus makes one immune from the effects of the virus in the future. In the case of Covid-19, that proposition is questionable.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reported on the so-called John Snow Memorandum, a letter signed by 6,200 \u201cscientists, health professionals, and research organizations,\u201d including UCS, which was published Oct. 14 in The Lancet under the headline: \u201cScientific consensus on the COVID-19 pandemic: We need to act now.\u201d UCS writes: \u201cThe John Snow Memorandum . . . warns that many factors render herd immunity a \u2018dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.\u2019 Chief among them are that the coronavirus is much deadlier than the seasonal flu, and it remains unclear how long any immunity lasts after one recovers from an infection, [which] makes it likely that a herd immunity strategy . . . will surely cause a huge number of preventable deaths, run the risk of triggering recurrent epidemics, and potentially \u2018overwhelm the ability of healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe GBD has now amassed support and signatures from over 10,000 medical and public health scientists, nearly 28,000 medical practitioners, well over 500,000 concerned citizens, and, now, the team surrounding the president of the United States. Only time will tell if this approach will be the panacea we\u2019ve all been hoping for and life can go back to normal after an unknown period of time or simply another desperate strategy that could end up costing more lives.\n\nThe epidemiologists who authored the Great Barrington Resolution are:\n\nFull text of the resolution along with information about its creation is online at \u201cgbdeclaration.org\u201d as well as extensive video of the event: \u201cFrom October 1-4, 2020, the American Institute for Economic Research hosted a remarkable meeting of top epidemiologists, economists, and journalists to discuss the global emergency created by the unprecedented use of state compulsion in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic. The result is The Great Barrington Declaration, which urges a \u2018Focused Protection\u2019 strategy.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["lockdowns", "Covid-19", "GBD"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://www.nldbc.com/Millennium", "https://orders.cloudsna.com/?cid=MKT412194&eid=MKT420575", "https://www.johnellis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Revelation_x264.mp4?_=1", "COVID-19 and the Agendas to Come", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
