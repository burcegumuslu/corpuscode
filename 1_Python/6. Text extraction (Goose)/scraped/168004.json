Invariably, however, those in power grow greedy, and what was intended to be a symbiotic relationship with both sides benefitting inevitably turns into a parasitic one, with a clear winner and a clear loser.\n\nWe have seen this vicious cycle play out over and over again throughout the nation\u2019s history.\n\nJust look at this COVID-19 pandemic: the whole sorry mess has been so overtly politicized, propagandized, and used to expand the government\u2019s powers (and Corporate America\u2019s bank balance) that it\u2019s difficult at times to distinguish between what may be legitimate health concerns and government power grabs.\n\nAfter all, the government has a history of shamelessly exploiting national emergencies for its own nefarious purposes. Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, civil unrest, economic instability, pandemics, natural disasters: the government has been taking advantage of such crises for years now in order to gain greater power over an unsuspecting and largely gullible populace.\n\nThis COVID-19 pandemic is no different.\n\nYet be warned: we will all lose if this pandemic becomes a showdown between COVID-19 vaccine mandates and the right to bodily integrity.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what your trigger issue is\u2014whether it\u2019s vaccines, abortion, crime, religion, immigration, terrorism or some other overtly politicized touchstone used by politicians as a rallying cry for votes\u2014we should all be concerned when governments and businesses (i.e., the Corporate State) join forces to compel individuals to sacrifice their to bodily integrity (which goes hand in hand with the right to conscience and religious freedom) on the altar of so-called safety and national security.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s unfolding right now, with public and private employers using the threat of termination to force employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nUnfortunately, legal protections in this area are limited.\n\nWhile the Americans with Disabilities Act protects those who can prove they have medical conditions that make receiving a vaccination dangerous, employees must be able to prove they have a sensitivity to vaccines.\n\nBeyond that, employees with a religious objection to the vaccine mandate can try to request an exemption, but even those who succeed in gaining an exemption to a vaccine mandate may have to submit to routine COVID testing and mask requirements, especially if their job involves contact with other individuals.\n\nUnder the First Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, individuals have a right of conscience and/or religious freedom to ask that their sincere religious beliefs against receiving vaccinations be accommodated. To this end, The Rutherford Institute has issued guidance and an in-depth fact sheet and model letter for those seeking a religious exemption to a COVID-19 vaccine mandate in the workplace. The Rutherford Institute\u2019s policy paper, \u201cKnow Your Rights: How To Request a Religious Accommodation for COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates in the Workplace,\u201d goes into the details of how and why and in which forums one can request such accommodation, but there is no win-win scenario.\n\nAs with all power plays of this kind, the ramifications of empowering the government and its corporate partners to force individuals to choose between individual liberty and economic survival during a so-called state of \u201cemergency\u201d can lead to terrifying results.\n\nAt a minimum, it\u2019s a slippery slope that justifies all manner of violations in the name of national security, the interest of the state and the so-called greater good.\n\nIf the government\u2014be it the President, Congress, the courts or any federal, state or local agent or agency\u2014can willfully disregard the rights of any particular person or group of persons, then that person becomes less than a citizen, less than human, less than deserving of respect, dignity, civility and bodily integrity. He or she becomes an \u201cit,\u201d a faceless number that can be tallied and tracked, a quantifiable mass of cells that can be discarded without conscience, an expendable cost that can be written off without a second thought, or an animal that can be bought, sold, branded, chained, caged, bred, neutered and euthanized at will.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly where we find ourselves now: caught in the crosshairs of a showdown between the rights of the individual and the so-called \u201cemergency\u201d state.\n\nAll of those freedoms we cherish\u2014the ones enshrined in the Constitution, the ones that affirm our right to free speech and assembly, due process, privacy, bodily integrity, the right to not have police seize our property without a warrant, or search and detain us without probable cause\u2014amount to nothing when the government and its agents are allowed to disregard those prohibitions on government overreach at will.\n\nThis is the grim reality of life in the American police state.\n\nOur so-called rights have been reduced to technicalities in the face of the government\u2019s ongoing power grabs.\n\nYet those who founded this country believed that what we conceive of as our rights were given to us by God\u2014we are created equal, according to the nation\u2019s founding document, the Declaration of Independence\u2014and that government cannot create nor can it extinguish our God-given rights. To do so would be to anoint the government with god-like powers and elevate it above the citizenry.\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is what happens when government officials are allowed to determine who is deserving of constitutional rights and who should be stripped of those rights for whatever reason may be justified by the courts and the legislatures.\n\nIn this way, concerns about COVID-19 mandates and bodily integrity are part of a much larger debate over the ongoing power struggle between the citizenry and the government over our property \u201cinterest\u201d in our bodies. For instance, who should get to decide how \u201cwe the people\u201d care for our bodies? Are we masters over our most private of domains, our bodies? Or are we merely serfs who must answer to an overlord that gets the final say over whether and how we live or die?\n\nThis debate over bodily integrity covers broad territory, ranging from abortion and euthanasia to forced blood draws, biometric surveillance and basic healthcare.\n\nForced vaccinations are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nForced vaccinations, forced cavity searches, forced colonoscopies, forced blood draws, forced breath-alcohol tests, forced DNA extractions, forced eye scans, forced inclusion in biometric databases: these are just a few ways in which Americans continue to be reminded that we have no control over what happens to our bodies during an encounter with government officials.\n\nConsider the case of in which the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision found nothing wrong when police officers read an man his rights and then proceeded to forcibly and warrantlessly draw his blood while he was still unconscious in order to determine if he could be charged with a DUI.\n\nTo sanction this forced blood draw, the cops and the courts hitched their wagon to state \u201cimplied consent\u201d laws (all of the states have them), which suggest that merely on a state-owned road implies that a person has consented to police sobriety tests, breathalyzers and blood draws.\n\nMore than half of the states (29 states) allow police to do warrantless, forced blood draws on unconscious individuals whom they suspect of driving while intoxicated.\n\nSeven state appeals courts have declared these warrantless blood draws when carried out on unconscious suspects are unconstitutional. Courts in seven other states have found that implied consent laws run afoul of the Fourth Amendment. And yet seven other states (including Wisconsin) have ruled that implied consent laws provide police with a free pass when it comes to the Fourth Amendment and forced blood draws.\n\nRead the writing on the wall, and you\u2019ll see how little remains of our right to bodily integrity in the face of the government\u2019s steady assaults on the Fourth Amendment.\n\nOur freedoms\u2014especially the Fourth Amendment\u2014continue to be strangulated by a prevailing view among government bureaucrats that they have the right to search, seize, strip, scan, spy on, probe, pat down, taser, and arrest individual at time and for the provocation.\n\nWorse, on a daily basis, Americans are being made to relinquish the most intimate details of who we are\u2014our biological makeup, our genetic blueprints, and our biometrics (facial characteristics and structure, fingerprints, iris scans, etc.)\u2014in order to clear the nearly insurmountable hurdle that increasingly defines life in the United States: we are now guilty until proven innocent.\n\nSuch is life in America today that individuals are being threatened with arrest and carted off to jail for the least hint of noncompliance, homes are being raided by militarized SWAT teams under the slightest pretext, property is being seized on the slightest hint of suspicious activity, and roadside police stops have devolved into government-sanctioned exercises in humiliation and degradation with a complete disregard for privacy and human dignity.\n\nWhile forced searches\u2014of one\u2019s person and property\u2014may span a broad spectrum of methods and scenarios, the common denominator remains the same: a complete disregard for the dignity and rights of the citizenry.\n\nUnfortunately, the indignities being heaped upon us by the architects and agents of the American police state\u2014whether or not we\u2019ve done anything wrong\u2014are just a foretaste of what is to come.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t need to tie you to a gurney and forcibly take your blood or strip you naked by the side of the road in order to render you helpless. As this showdown over COVID-19 vaccine mandates makes clear, the government has other methods\u2014less subtle perhaps but equally devastating\u2014of stripping you of your independence, robbing you of your dignity, and undermining your rights.\n\nWith every court ruling that allows the government to operate above the rule of law, every piece of legislation that limits our freedoms, and every act of government wrongdoing that goes unpunished, we\u2019re slowly being conditioned to a society in which we have little real control over our bodies or our lives.\n\nYou may not realize it yet, but you are not free.\n\nIf you believe otherwise, it is only because you have made no real attempt to exercise your freedoms.\n\nHad you attempted to exercise your freedoms before now by questioning a police officer\u2019s authority, challenging an unjust tax or fine, protesting the government\u2019s endless wars, defending your right to privacy against the intrusion of surveillance cameras, or any other effort that challenges the government\u2019s power grabs and the generally lopsided status quo, you would have already learned the hard way that the American Police State has no appetite for freedom and it does not tolerate resistance.\n\nAs Glenn Greenwald notes for the :\n\nGet ready to stand your ground or run for your life.\n\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , our government \u201cof the people, by the people and for the people\u201d has been transformed into a greedy pack of wolves that is on the hunt.\n\n\u201cWe the people\u201d are the prey.\n\nConstitutional attorney and author John W.
