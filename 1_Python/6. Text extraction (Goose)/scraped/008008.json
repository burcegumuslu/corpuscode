I told the lady that I needed info. on required vaccinations for attendance. Then I explained that we had provided the proof of immunization for 6th grade, but I had seen on the updated schedule that my son was due for a Dtap (if 5 yrs. from last dose) and the meningococcal vac. is now on the schedule too, but I was unsure if it was mandatory. She said they do not require proof of anything beyond the up to date 6th grade record. Apparently, boosters or the meningococcal are not required for school attendance. THEN she told me that her daughter was a nurse at a local hospital here, and that they had seen menningitis already this year\n\nI asked her how we would know if a vaccine did become a requirement. She said they would be notified by the State, their computer program would be changed to include the new vaccine, it would flag everyone, and a note would be sent out at that time, notifing us that we were not current. Then, she said there are Many Many mistakes btwn dates that get reported to the State, and the parents vaccine cards, however it made no difference to them as long as they were all there. I think I posted how incomplete my sons vaccine records are. I would bet Sydnie did have her series, and someone put down the wrong date.\n\nThey don't want us playing Dr. and darn, I don't want too, but I wish someone would! If I knew it was weird that she was supposed to get one now, wouldn't someone there have figured that out? Maybe there is a logical explaination and I'm shooting my mouth off prematurely. This vaccine in particular makes me really angry because of the time frame it was given, and how UNLIKELY my new baby was to EVER get hep b in the first yr. after birth, or before they became sexually active, or got a tatoo, or started shooting drugs, had blood to blood contact with an infected person, sheesh, I think we had time!!\n\nPlease let us know how this turns out Lisa.\n\nI was talking to a friend tonite, and she just had her kids in for a well child visit, and her Pediatrician recommended the Meningococcal vac. for her 12 yr. old son. She said she declined for now, so apparently the Dr.s are recommending it. That's what happened with the chicken pox vac. too, then all of a sudden, they decided lost wages justified ANOTHER vaccine, and made it mandatory. I was one of the parents who got the chicken pox vaccine BEFORE they made it mandatory. Now, I worry that the immunity will wear off when they're older, when it's more dangerous, as it is really unknown at this time how long the immunity lasts. I don't want to make any more of these mistakes, without really looking into both sides of a recommended vaccine. I didn't look into anything period. I just trusted.\n\nThought I better add that there have been children who have become seriously ill, and even deaths associated with chicken pox.
