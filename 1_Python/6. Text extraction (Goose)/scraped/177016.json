This study also proved the vaccine 90 percent effective for at least six months at preventing hospitalization of infected people.\n\nThe Israeli study involved more than 4,800 fully vaccinated healthcare workers. From Dec, 19, 2020, to July 9, 2021, their antibody response was tested monthly. The researchers found a significant waning of immune responses\u2014especially among men, people over 65 and immunosuppressed people.\n\n\u201cThe decrease in neutralizing antibody titers was brisk initially, in the period of up to 70 to 80 days, but slowed thereafter,\u201d according to the study.\n\nThe researchers noted a \u201cstriking difference\u201d between vaccinated people and recovered COVID-19 patients: \u201cOverall, the accumulating evidence from our study and others show that long-term humoral [immune] response and vaccine effectiveness in previously infected persons is superior to that in recipients of two doses of vaccine.\u201d\n\nThis may explain the substantially lower incidence of breakthrough infection among previously infected persons than among vaccinated persons.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Gili Regev Yochay, chief of infectious disease epidemiology at Sheba Medical Center, said the new study was one of three that contributed to the Israeli government\u2019s world-first decision to administer a third (booster) shot to citizens that had been fully vaccinated at least five months before.\n\n\u201cWe have shown in our previous work in the New England Journal of Medicine that there is a correlation between neutralizing antibodies and breakthrough infection,\u201d she said.\n\nThe third study that influenced the decision to administer boosters relied on Israeli Health Ministry data indicating a decrease in vaccine effectiveness over six months.\n\nThe researchers also created a predictive model to assess the likelihood of different morbidity levels in various subpopulations. This could help health practitioners make decisions about specific patients.\n\nNow, said Regev Yochay, Israeli and international scientists are working to quantify the threshold of antibodies required to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection, from severe COVID-19, and from death due to the disease.\n\n\u201cAfter we learn the threshold of antibodies, the large table of probabilities we are publishing will help predict what is the right preventive measure for the different subpopulations,\u201d she concluded in a statement to the press.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Israeli study: Pfizer vaccine wears off after six months", "description": "Published in the \u201cNew England Journal of Medicine,\u201d the researchers found a significant waning of immune responses\u2014especially among men, people over 65 and immunosuppressed people.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/348891/israeli-study-pfizer-vaccine-wears-off-after-six-months/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2021-10-08T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/F210214DC78-2-880x495-1.jpg", "image:width": "880", "image:height": "495", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.israel21c.org/israel-first-to-offer-covid-vaccine-booster-to-ages-50/", "https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-study-suggests-booster-vaccine-highly-effective/"], "authors": ["JNS"], "publish_date": "2021-10-08T00:00:00+00:00"}
