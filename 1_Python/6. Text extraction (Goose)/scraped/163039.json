You've done plenty of research on the topic. When kids from birth through i supposed like grade school, get their scheduled vaccines, where do you see potential issues with that? Dr. Stephanie Seneff: I'm very disturbed about the situation with vaccines in this country. And of course, when you look at the statistics, you look at the countries, the numbers of vaccines that are required in different countries and you compare that to the health of the children, and even the mortality rates. We have the highest mortality on the first day of life among the developed world. And we have really high mortality rates under five and first year. We do much worse than the other countries and we have the most vaccine requirements. Now that may be completely unrelated, but supposedly vaccines are supposed to protect from childhood mortality. So it's quite odd to think that the country with the most vaccines has the most mortality. I'm worried about all of them and I'm worried about many of the chemicals in the vaccines. I've investigated several, certainly the aluminum, the glutamate, the mercury, which has been talked about a lot. Glutamate is not so much known but that one's very, very interesting. And them I'm also looking at some other ones, of course there's formaldehyde. You know it's amazing to me that the government doesn't think there's a problem injecting things into children. Children are very vulnerable to these kinds of toxic chemicals. And they know these things are toxic. And why they don't think there would be a problem is quite a mystery to me.\n\nScott: Let's talk about vaccines a little bit. You've done plenty of research on the topic.
