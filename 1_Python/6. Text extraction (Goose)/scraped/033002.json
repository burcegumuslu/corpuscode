His words are reported by the Telegram channel URA.RU.\n\nAs the politician admitted, the first three vaccinations he received were Sputnik V vaccines. He injected the third dose when antibodies began to decrease. Six months later, Zhirinovsky was vaccinated with two doses of another Russian vaccine against coronavirus \u2013 EpiVac. As soon as his number of antibodies decreased, Zhirinovsky made the third vaccination with EpiVac. The seventh vaccination is the flu shot, which Zhirinovsky said he gets every year.\n\n\u201cBut before that, I had six vaccinations in a year and a half! The very first did! And the flu is common \u2013 every year \u2013 I did it too. Seven vaccinations! Of course, this is a burden, it is difficult, but we must secure each other, \u201d said the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nThe politician also noted that it is impossible to stop the disease if the Russians are not \u201cvaccinated\u201d. In his opinion, the \u201cinfection\u201d will go away if you get vaccinated.\n\nEarlier, Zhirinovsky suggested that three parties \u2013 the Communist Party of the Russian Federation , Fair Russia \u2013 For the Truth and New People \u2013 pay the cost of non-working days, which will be introduced in the country from October 30. Zhirinovsky wrote that, according to some estimates, the non-working day regime will cost the Russian economy 60 billion rubles. This amount, according to him, can be recovered from those organizations that, before the elections to the State Duma, \u201cparasitized on anti-vaccination sentiments, which led to an outbreak of morbidity.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Zhirinovsky Says He Has Injected Himself With 6 COVID Vaccine Doses So Far", "description": "LDPR\u00a0chairman\u00a0Vladimir Zhirinovsky\u00a0said that in a year and a half he had made seven vaccinations, including six from COVID-19.\u00a0His words are\u00a0reported by the\u00a0Telegram\u00a0channel\u00a0URA.RU.\r\n\r\nAs the politician admitted, the first three vaccinations he received were Sputnik V vaccines.\u00a0He injected the third", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/zhirinovsky-says-he-has-injected-himself-with-6-covid-vaccine-doses-so-far/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photo_2021-10-27_00-08-58.jpg", "image:width": "447", "image:height": "300", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-10-26T18:15:55+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-26T18:15:55+02:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photo_2021-10-27_00-08-58.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-10-26T18:15:55+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": ["Communist Party of the Russian Federation", "URA.RU.", "Fair Russia", "LDPR", "Vladimir Zhirinovsky", "State Duma,"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://lenta.ru/tags/organizations/ldpr/", "https://lenta.ru/tags/persons/zhirinovskiy-vladimir/", "https://t.me/uranews/30952", "https://lenta.ru/tags/organizations/ria-ura-ru/", "https://lenta.ru/news/2021/10/22/zhirinovsky/", "https://lenta.ru/tags/organizations/kprf/", "https://lenta.ru/tags/organizations/spravedlivaya-rossiya/", "https://lenta.ru/tags/organizations/gosduma/", "https://lenta.ru/news/2021/10/26/six/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-10-26T18:15:55+02:00"}
