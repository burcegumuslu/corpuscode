I am still just a couple of months new to this forum, but much has happened. Oldest DS in process of officially being dx'ed w/ PANDAS (has had for many years). He has been escalated to a well-known university med center neuro psych dept. They have already reviewed his case and want to take it on. We may still need to veer to a PANDAS doc but are following this route (with insurance) for the time being.. In the course of testing he was found to have CVID - common variable immuno deficiency - his is low IGM, IGg2 and IGg4.\n\nSince then, DS 19 and myself have been tested and both found to have CVID. DS19 presents exactly the same deficiencies as his brother but even lower values. He does not have symptoms of PANDAS, but does have other health challenges. I have low IGA and low IGg1. I have another DS17 who does have symptoms of PANDAS, but much more under control than oldest son. He has not yet been tested, but will soon and may follow what we decide to do. He is also leaving for college in the Fall and has been asked to receive the Menningitis vaccine.\n\nThe immunologist also determined that all of us have very low or undetectable levels of iGg antibodies for STREP PNEUMONIAE. He wants to vaccinate all of us with the PNEUMOVAX, and 4-6 weeks after we receive this vaccine, recheck our titers to see if our bodies responded appropriately by making antibodies against STREP PNEUMONIAE. Probably a standard response, but I have developed a mistrust of vaccines and although the boys received all childhood vaccines of the times up to 12, I have opted out since.\n\nQ - does this seem like a good thing to do, particularly with the oldest? I also should mention that we do have a family member who developed Guillan-Barre after receiving a swine flu vaccine in the 80's - so I have seen first-hand the damage that can result from a vaccination reaction.\n\nVaccinate for the tracking info, or not? I am torn. If we don't, any input on how to gather the same info from another direction?", "opengraph": {"title": "Pneumovax for Family?", "type": "website", "url": "https://latitudes.org/forums/topic/16763-pneumovax-for-family/", "description": "HI all - Looking for input.
