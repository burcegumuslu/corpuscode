They can\u2019t be violated.\n\n\"This is a Pandora\u2019s Box and we don\u2019t know what will happen to people injected with an unproven vaccine.\u201d\n\nRussian health workers treating COVID-19 patients will be offered the chance of volunteering to be vaccinated soon after the vaccine's approval, a source said previously.\n\nIt comes after Russia reported 4,945 new coronavirus cases and 130 deaths in the past 24 hours, with the official death toll rising to 15,131\n\nThis pushed its national case tally to 897,599, the fourth largest in the world.\n\nMore than 100 possible vaccines are being developed around the world to try to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt least four are in final Phase III human trials, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, including three developed in China and another in Britain.\n\n[RELATED] Bill Gates: 'Final Hurdle' for COVID-19 Vaccine is Ensuring People Take It", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/russia-covid-vaccine-tested-putin-daughter-112820.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Russia's 'World's First' COVID Vaccine Was Tested on Putin's Own Daughter", "description": "Russian president claims his country has approved first coronavirus vaccine - Russsian President Vladimir Putin announced this week that Russias health ministry has approved ... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Russia", "coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/russia-to-launch-worlds-first-covid-19-vaccine-on-august-12.html", "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1321304/coronavirus-vaccine-russia-vladimir-putin-covid19-vaccine-latest", "../../news/11795-bill-gates-final-hurdle-for-covid-19-vaccine-is-ensuring-people-take-it"], "authors": ["Jay Greenberg"], "publish_date": "2020-08-12"}
