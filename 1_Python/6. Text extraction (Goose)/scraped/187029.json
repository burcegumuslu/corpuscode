And as California goes, so goes much of the country. That little county may have saved us all across this nation from a mandated COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d Bigtree said.\n\nAccording to a report by local news channel KRCR 7, hundreds of Shasta County students, parents and teachers participated in a school walkout on Oct. 18, 2021 against the compulsory COVID-19 injections.\n\nJustin Hefley, whose daughter attends a school in Shasta Meadows Elementary SD, said the walkout did not surprise him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not surprised at all [and] that\u2019s something that I support. I think parents and teachers should have their choice on whether they get this vaccine or not,\u201d he said.\n\nSD superintendents have attested to the impact of the walkouts.\n\nShasta Union High SD Superintendent Jim Cloney said roughly 40 percent of students were absent that day; Enterprise Elementary SD Superintendent Heather Armelino said roughly 45 percent of students in her SD stayed home and that around five to six percent of teachers took the day off; and Happy Valley Union Elementary SD Superintendent Shelly Craig said 234 of their students did not show up that day.\n\nWalkouts in one small county has huge impact in whole state\n\nBigtree noted that ICAN lodged Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests about the walkouts\u2019 repercussions, with the help of the group\u2019s legal counsel Aaron Siri.\n\n\u201cWe put in FOIA requests and wanted to know what effect it had. Lo and behold, we found out that the superintendents across the county \u2013 over 25 of them \u2013 got together and sent a letter,\u201d said the ICAN founder.\n\nThe Nov. 15, 2021 letter was addressed to the California Department of Public Health and several officials in the Golden State, including Gov. Gavin Newsom. Other officials named in the letter included State Sens. Richard Pan and Ben Allen, alongside Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis in her capacity as president of the California State Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have received many emails and have heard many hours of public comment from parents who are concerned about how quickly these vaccinations have been developed and tested. A majority of the families in our community are expressing hesitancy with regard to vaccinating their children \u2013 as many as 80 percent, according to one of our largest district\u2019s surveys,\u201d the superintendents wrote.\n\n\u201cThey are voicing their request for a choice and their plans to withdraw their children from public school if vaccines are required. Forty-five percent of families across Shasta County public schools kept their students home on Oct. 18 to demonstrate their opposition to the vaccine mandate.\u201d\n\nThe superintendents warned that \u201cfrom 25 to 70 percent of students, depending on the district\u201d would no longer enroll in Shasta County public schools if COVID-19 vaccines become mandatory and exemptions to the shot are eliminated.\n\n\u201cThis could very well mean the closure of many of our smaller SDs and fracturing of our larger [SDs].\u201d\n\nThe pushback from Shasta County parents, students and teachers paid off \u2013 in the form of Pan walking back on his proposed legislation requiring children to get the COVID-19 shot. (Related: California State Sen. Richard Pan PAUSES mandatory COVID vaccination bill for schoolchildren due to LOW vaccine uptake.)\n\n\u201cWhat this shows us is how we fight \u2026 [and] stand up for what we believe, and when we stand together \u2013 power to the people \u2013 we make a difference,\u201d concluded Bigtree. \u201cThank you, Shasta County, for being bold. We are winning.\u201d\n\nWatch the full excerpt of \u201cThe HighWire\u201d where Del Bigtree talks about the Shasta County school walkouts.\n\nThis video is from The HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nLAWSUIT: California parents want schools to fully reopen as students struggle with distance learning.\n\nCalifornia school board votes not to support, enforce or comply with pending COVID-19 vaccine mandate.\n\nCalifornia legislators, including Richard Pan, trying to force all schoolchildren to get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for covid.\n\nRichard Pan says Americans who refuse experimental coronavirus gene therapy injections are \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Del Bigtree: Walkouts in Shasta County SDs sent ripples that led to cancellation of COVID vaccine mandate for California students", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2022-08-16-del-bigtree-school-walkouts-repeal-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Del Bigtree, founder and CEO of the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), credited the walkouts staged in various school districts (SDs)\u00a0throughout California\u2019s Shasta County for the cancellation of the vaccine mandate for students in the Golden State.
