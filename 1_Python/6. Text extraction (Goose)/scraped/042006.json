Miller reports on the relationship between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) death and the timing of vaccination, based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database.\n\nSIDS is defined as the sudden and unexpected death of an infant that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation. Although there are no specific symptoms associated with SIDS, an autopsy often reveals congestion and edema of the lungs and inflammatory changes in the respiratory system, according to the National Center for Health Statistics Vital Statistics of the United States 1988, Volume II, Mortality, Part A, Public Health Service, 1991.\n\nPrior to contemporary vaccination programs, SIDS \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201ccrib death\u201d \u2014 was so infrequent it was not mentioned in infant mortality statistics.\n\nAfter the national immunization campaigns were initiated in the U.S. in the 1960s, for the first time in history, most U.S. infants were required to receive several doses of DPT, polio, measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.\n\nShortly after, in 1969, medical certifiers presented a new medical term \u2014 sudden infant death syndrome.\n\nIn 1973, the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics added a new cause-of-death category \u2014 SIDS \u2014 to the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\n\nBy 1980, SIDS had become the leading cause of postneonatal mortality (deaths of infants from 28 days to one year old) in the U.S.\n\nAs Miller points out in his article, the ICD category for vaccine-related death, or cause of death as \u201cprophylactic inoculation and vaccination,\u201d was eliminated when the ICD was revised in 1979 \u2014 despite the fact that this information would be useful in trying to understand the relationship between vaccination and death.\n\nBut Miller, a medical research journalist and the director of the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute, provides an alternative route for establishing such a correlation \u2014 by observing the temporal relationship between vaccines and reported infant deaths, including SIDS deaths, in the CDC\u2019s VAERS database.\n\nMiller found that out of a total of 2,605 infant deaths reported to VAERS from 1990 through 2019, the majority \u201cclustered\u201d in close temporal proximity to vaccination \u2014 58% occurred within three days of vaccination, and 78% occurred within seven days of vaccination.\n\nMiller found the excess deaths within these ranges were statistically significant (p<0.00001), meaning the chance that this result is random is less than 0.001%.\n\nThe same type of clustering was present in the 1,048 reports of infant deaths (out of the total 2,605) reported to VAERS specifically as SIDS.\n\nAccording to Miller, if there were no correlation between vaccination and infant deaths, one would expect to see an even spacing of deaths within the time range reported prior to vaccination \u2014- not a clustering of deaths as Miller found.\n\nMiller included a comprehensive literature review in his paper refuting the \u201cofficial\u201d claim that the SIDS epidemic was curtailed by having infants sleep on their backs \u2014 as recommended by the \u201cBack to Sleep\u201d campaign, initiated in 1992 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nThe subsequent rate of SIDS dropped by an annual average of 8.6% between 1992 and 2001. However, the neonatal mortality rate due to \u201csuffocation in bed\u201d increased during that same time at an average annual rate of 11.2%.\n\nOther similar causes of infant death also increased significantly during this period, as reported by Miller. Further, from 1999 through 2015, the U.S. SIDS rate declined 35.8%. while infant deaths due to accidental suffocation increased 183.8 %.\n\nMiller also affirms his main results from the paper (i.e., the temporal clustering of SIDS deaths with vaccination) through the discussion of seven additional peer-reviewed studies and two confidential reports.\n\nOn average, these authors found that substantial proportions of infant deaths occurred within one day (mean = 25%), three days (mean = 49%) and seven days (mean = 71%) post-vaccination, matching the results of the present study.\n\nMechanistically, vaccine injury has been tied to SIDS multiple times. Matturri et al. (2014) examined 13 SIDS deaths occurring within seven days of a hexavalent vaccine. Analysis of the brainstem and cerebellum of the deceased infants showed brain edema and congestion in all victims.\n\nThe authors hypothesized that \u201cseveral compounds and immuno-potentiation adjuvants of the hexavalent vaccine might easily go beyond the blood-brain barrier, which in the first year of life is still immature and quite permeable, inducing neuronal molecular alterations in DNA, RNA and proteins of brainstem neurons regulating vital functions, with consequent fatal disorganization of respiratory control in particularly predisposed infants.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, these authors implicated aluminum-based adjuvants in the dysregulation of respiratory control.\n\nScheibner and Karlsson (1991) monitored infant breathing during sleep before and after the DPT vaccination, revealing an increase in episodes where breathing nearly ceased or stopped completely. These episodes, which continued for several weeks post-vaccination, were not seen prior to vaccination.\n\nDespite the official insistence that SIDS deaths are not caused by vaccination, as Miller points out, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation (NVICP) is set up to compensate families of individuals who are injured and/or die from vaccine administration.\n\nDeath from vaccination is compensated with $250,000 for \u201cpain and suffering\u201d to family members of the deceased victim. Conditions typically leading to death that are considered \u201ctable injuries\u201d to be compensated under the NVICP include anaphylaxis and encephalopathy or encephalitis.\n\n\u2018Healthy babies just don\u2019t die for no apparent reason\u2019\n\nKari Bundy, who lost her son after his four-month vaccinations, said she\u2019s always been \u201cflabbergasted\u201d at the denial of the medical community of the link between SIDS and vaccines. \u201cFor me, it was too obvious to even attempt to ignore,\u201d Bundy said.\n\n\u201cA few days after his routine four-month vaccinations, my husband and I discovered his dead body in the middle of the night, laying on his side, his body still warm,\u201d Bundy said\n\nMason\u2019s autopsy came back \u201cunremarkable,\u201d aside from some thymic petechiae, which is the most common gross finding in SIDS cases at autopsy.\n\n\u201cI was assured time and time again that he had not suffocated,\u201d Bundy said.\n\nWhen Mason died, Bundy learned if you can\u2019t pay for a funeral, you can\u2019t have one. So a few months after Mason\u2019s death, she founded a nonprofit called Mason\u2019s Cause, to provide grants to cover funeral costs for families who had experienced the loss of a child under the age of 1.\n\n\u201cI never wanted any parent to experience this devastating loss and not be able to bury their child,\u201d Bundy said. She continued running the charity for just under 2 years, during which time she worked with 94 different families who experienced the death of a child under age 1.\n\nOf those 94 infant deaths, 87 died from SIDS, or from causes \u201cunknown.\u201d Of the SIDS cases, 81 \u2014 or 93% \u2014 died within seven days of routine vaccinations.\n\n\u201cWhen I realized SIDS seemed to be undeniably related to vaccines, I realized I could no longer dedicate my life to running a charity that would help bury babies,\u201d Bundy said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized I wanted to save babies by speaking out about the real risks of vaccination.\u201d\n\nBundy, who works for Children\u2019s Health Defense as translations coordinator, said she\u2019s grateful for research like Miller\u2019s because it shows what she and all SIDS parents already knew \u2014 healthy babies don\u2019t just die for no apparent reason.\n\nListen to the interview with Neil Miller, author of the study of SIDS and vaccines, on the \u201cRight on Point\u201d Podcast:\n\nThe post 58% of Infant Deaths Reported to VAERS Occurred Within 3 Days of Vaccination, Research Shows appeared first on Children\u2019s Health Defense.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Awake Canada", "type": "article", "title": "58% of Infant Deaths Reported to VAERS Occurred Within 3 Days of Vaccination, Research Shows", "description": "In a new research paper published in the journal Toxicology Reports, author Neil Z.
