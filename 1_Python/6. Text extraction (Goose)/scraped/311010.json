VAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe data included a total of 19,886 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 354 over the previous week \u2014 and 150,946 reports of serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period \u2014 up 4,226 compared with the previous week.\n\nExcluding \u201cforeign reports\u201d to VAERS, 681,962 adverse events, including 9,136 deaths and 58,503 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and Dec. 3, 2021.\n\nForeign reports are reports received by U.S. manufacturers from their foreign subsidiaries. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product\u2019s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 9,136 U.S. deaths reported as of Dec. 3, 20% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 25% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 61% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 466 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of Dec. 3. This includes 271 million doses of Pfizer, 178 million doses of Moderna and 17 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Historically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Dec. 3, 2021 for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\u2022 3,301 adverse events, including 58 rated as serious and 2 reported deaths. One death occurred in an 11-year-old girl from Georgia vaccinated Sept. 14, prior to the authorization of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine in the 5 to 11 age group.\n\nThe second death (VAERS I.D. 1890705) occurred in a 5-year-old girl who died four days after receiving her first dose of Pfizer.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Dec. 3, 2021 for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 24,359 adverse events, including 1,474 rated as serious and 33 reported deaths.\n\nThe most recent deaths involve a 13-year-old girl from Texas (VAERS I.D. 1913198) who died 31 days after receiving her COVID vaccine. According to her VAERS report, the girl received her first dose of Pfizer on Aug. 1. Two weeks later, she complained of vague upper back pain and was diagnosed with a rare soft tissue cancer located on her heart despite having no previous medical history. Parents requested a VAERS report be filed in case her cancer was related to the vaccine. Her cancer and heart condition rapidly and progressively worsened and she died Dec 1.\n\nThe second death involves a 17-year-old girl from Minnesota (VAERS I.D. 1912785) who experienced cardiac arrest and died at home after receiving her first dose of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\u2022 60 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death \u2014 with 96% of cases\n\n attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 567 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) with 557 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 141 reports of blood clotting disorders, with all cases attributed to Pfizer.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to Dec. 3, 2021, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 19% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 42% were female and the remaining death reports did not include gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 72.7.\n\u2022 As of Dec. 3, 4,538 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1,428 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 3,249 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 41% to Moderna and 8% to J&J.\n\u2022 784 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), with 42% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 29% to Moderna and 27% to J&J.\n\u2022 2,184 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.\n\u2022 11,514 reports of blood clotting disorders. Of those, 5,112 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 4,101 reports to Moderna and 2,249 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 3,333 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 2,074 cases attributed to Pfizer, 1,109 cases to Moderna and 140 cases to J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\nFDA, CDC sign off on Pfizer boosters for 16- and 17-year-olds, suggest 3rd shot for younger kids may come soon\n\nThe CDC on Thursday signed off on Emergency Use Authorization of booster doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 16- and 17- year olds.\n\nApproval from CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky came hours after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized booster doses for the same age group.\n\nWalensky said in a statement initial data suggest a third shot will help strengthen protection against Omicron and other variants, and she urged older teens to get the booster.\n\nThe FDA on Thursday authorized the booster doses for 16- and 17-year-olds at least six months after receiving their second dose of the vaccine, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe FDA broadened Pfizer\u2019s authorization to cover the younger age group on an emergency basis as initial research suggested the new Omicron variant undermines antibody protection of two doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nPfizer boosters will be available to 16- and 17-year-olds at least six months after they received their initial two doses of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines remain authorized only for adults\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC today said it was \u201cconsidering\u201d boosters for 5- to 11-year-olds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re first starting to get our 5- to 11-year-olds vaccinated,\u201d Walensky said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look again at the 12- to 15-year-olds, of course, as with the FDA, in real-time.\u201d\n\nRoughly two-thirds of parents of elementary school-aged children are either holding off on getting their younger kids vaccinated or refuse to do so, according to ABC7 in New York.\n\nThe latest data from Missouri show 730 people died from COVID despite being fully vaccinated. According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the state recorded 760,035 COVID cases as of Dec. 9.\n\nMore than 11,321 fully vaccinated people in Massachusetts tested positive for COVID last week \u2014 an increase of 71% over the 6,610 breakthrough infections reported the previous week.\n\nBreakthrough cases in Massachusetts account for 40% of the state\u2019s overall cases in recent months as the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness wanes after six months. In all, 88,968 fully vaccinated people have tested positive for the virus since Dec. 14, according to data from the state\u2019s Department of Public Health on Tuesday.\n\nData provided by the Connecticut Department of Public Health showed an increase in breakthrough cases over the past four weeks. A total of 4,143 breakthrough cases were reported over the previous week ending Wednesday \u2014 an increase from Dec. 2, when there were a total of 2,553 new breakthrough cases.\n\nOf the 4,143 identified breakthrough cases in Connecticut most occurred among patients between the ages of 35 and 64. There were 802 breakthrough cases in patients 35 to 44, 842 cases in patients aged 55 to 64, 33 breakthrough infections among children aged 12 to 15 and 321 cases in patients 75 and older.\n\nDefinition of fully vaccinated will change to include 3rd dose\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the definition of fully vaccinated is changed to include a third dose, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the CDC website, \u201cfully vaccinated persons are those who are \u226514 days post completion of the primary series of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe term fully vaccinated refers to a person who has received two doses of Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines or a single shot of Johnson & Johnson. The definition has implications because it is used by those imposing vaccine mandates across the country, including federal mandates for healthcare workers, government contractors and private businesses with more than 100 employees.\n\nFour doses of COVID vaccine likely needed to combat Omicron variant\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Wednesday people may need a fourth dose of the COVID vaccine sooner than expected after preliminary research showed the Omicron variant can undermine antibody protection in people who only received two doses.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech released results from their initial lab study showing a third dose was protective against the new variant, but the initial two-dose series dropped significantly in its ability to protect against the new strain.\n\nBourla said three doses against Omicron are equivalent to the two doses\u2019 effectiveness against the original variant, although more data is needed from tests using the actual virus. Real-world results will be more accurate and are expected in the next two weeks, he said.\n\nBourla previously predicted a fourth dose would be needed 12 months after the third dose, but said with Omicron, \u201cwe may need it faster.\u201d\n\n120 teens hospitalized, 3 dead following Pfizer vaccine rollout for 15- to 17-year-olds in Vietnam\n\nThe Vietnamese province of Thanh Hoa suspended a batch of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID vaccine after more than 120 teens were hospitalized after being vaccinated.\n\nAccording to the province\u2019s CDC, the teens were hospitalized for symptoms ranging from nausea and high fevers to breathing difficulties \u2014 with 17 children exhibiting severe reactions.\n\nSince the rollout began on Nov. 30, three Vietnamese teens died after receiving Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, including two 12-year olds and a 16-year-old.\n\nThe Health Ministry said the deaths were caused by \u201coverreaction to the vaccine,\u201d not by a problem with the quality of the vaccine or the vaccination process.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.\n\nMegan Redshaw is a freelance reporter for The Defender.
