Seneff, Ph.D., a senior research scientist at MIT who has been conducting research at MIT for over five decades, has spent a large portion of her career investigating the hazards and mechanisms of action of glyphosate.\n\nHer attention was diverted to the science of mRNA gene transfer technologies in early 2020, when Operation Warp Speed was announced. As noted in her paper, many factors that lacked precedent, yet were being implemented at breakneck speed, included:\n\u2022 The first-ever use of PEG in an injection\n\u2022 The first-ever use of mRNA gene transfer technology against an infectious agent\n\u2022 The first-ever \u201cvaccine\u201d to make no clear claims about reducing infection, transmissibility or death\n\u2022 The first-ever coronavirus vaccine ever tested on humans (and previous coronavirus vaccines all failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement, a condition in which the antibodies actually facilitate infection rather than defend against it)\n\u2022 The first-ever use of genetically modified polynucleotides in the general population\n\nIn a May 2021 interview with me, Seneff said:\n\n\u201cTo have developed this incredibly new technology so quickly, and to skip so many steps in the process of evaluating [its safety], it\u2019s an insanely reckless thing that they\u2019ve done. My instinct was that this is bad, and I needed to know [the truth].\n\nSo, I really dug into the research literature by the people who\u2019ve developed these vaccines, and then more extensive research literature around those topics. And I don\u2019t see how these vaccines can possibly be doing anything good \u2026\u201d\n\nAt the time, just five months into the mass inoculation campaign, Seneff suspected the COVID shots would end up killing far more people than the infection itself. Today, a full year into it, the statistics are grim beyond belief, proving her educated prediction to have been an astute one.\n\nAs of December 3, 2021, the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has logged an astounding 927,738 COVID jab related adverse events, including 19,886 deaths. VAERS can receive reports from vaccine manufacturers and other international sources, and if we exclude those, the death toll reported in U.S. territories exclusively stands at 9,136.\n\nOf the total death reports, Pfizer \u2014 the only company that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted full licensing for an as-yet unavailable COVID shot \u2014 accounts for the vast majority: 13,268, compared to 4,894 for Moderna, 1,651 for Janssen and 73 for an undisclosed brand.\n\nPfizer also accounts for the vast majority of hospitalizations post-injection, and while those over the age of 66 make up the bulk of deaths, the 25-to-50 age group accounts for most of the hospitalizations. Key side effects that are now being reported in massive numbers include:\n\u2022 Heart problems such as heart attacks and myopericarditis\n\u2022 A variety of permanent disabilities, many of which involve neurological dysfunction\n\nAll of these consequences were predicted by Seneff and Nigh in their paper, which makes the events all the more tragic. Importantly, VAERS is notoriously underreported, so the real-world impact of these shots is far greater than what those data suggest.\n\nThe Cure Is Indeed Worse Than the Disease\n\nCalculations performed by Steve Kirsch, executive director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, and his team of statisticians suggest VAERS COVID-related reports are underreported by a factor of 41. This is a conservative estimate, supported by calculations using a variety of sources besides VAERS itself.\n\nThat means that in the U.S. alone (using the data for U.S. territories only), the actual death toll may be closer to 374,576 (including international deaths reported to VAERS would put the death toll at 815,326), and those are deaths that occurred within days or weeks post-injection.\n\nAs Seneff and Nigh explain in their paper, there\u2019s overwhelming reason to suspect that these gene transfer injections will have devastating impacts in the long term, resulting in excess deaths over the next decade.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s clear that the death toll from the COVID-19 infection itself in the U.S. has been vastly exaggerated, as it\u2019s based on positive PCR tests and even mere suspicion of COVID in the absence of testing. Many died from other causes and just happened to have a positive COVID test at the time of death.\n\nKirsch estimates the real death tally from COVID-19 to be about 50% of the reported number (which is likely conservative). This means about 380,000 Americans died from COVID-19 (rather than with COVID), whereas the COVID shots may have killed more than 374,570 in the first 11 months alone.\n\nAs predicted in the title of Seneff\u2019s paper, it seems the cure may indeed end up being worse than the disease. This is particularly true for children and young adults, who have either died or been permanently disabled by the shots by the thousands, while having an extraordinarily low risk of dying from or being seriously harmed by the infection itself.\n\nSeneff suspects that in the next 10 to 15 years, we\u2019ll see a dramatic spike in prion diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases at younger ages, and blood disorders such as blood clots, hemorrhaging, stroke and heart failure.\n\nThe Spike Protein Is the Most Dangerous Part of SARS-CoV-2\n\nThe reason we\u2019re seeing all these problems from the COVID shots is because they program your cells to continuously produce SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which we now know is the most dangerous part of the virus. Many experts noted this from the start, wondering what the vaccine developers could possibly be thinking, selecting this as the antigen for their shots.\n\nWhile the mRNA injections can cause harm in many different ways, one basic problem is that they can overstimulate your immune system to the point of failure. In summary, as your cells start producing the viral spike proteins, your immune cells rally to mop up the proteins and dump them into your lymphatic system. (This is why many report swollen lymph nodes under the arms.)\n\nThe antibody response is part of your humoral immunity. You also have cellular immunity, which is part of your innate immune system. Your innate immune system is very powerful. If you\u2019re healthy, it can clear viruses without ever producing a single antibody. Antibodies are actually a second-tier effect when your innate immune system fails.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "MIT Scientist: mRNA 'Vaccines' Worse Than The Disease", "description": "MIT Professor Stephanie Seneff forecasts a dramatic spike in deadly health conditions in the future, like autoimmune disease, blood disorders, strokes, heart attacks and always fatal prion (Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob) disease.
