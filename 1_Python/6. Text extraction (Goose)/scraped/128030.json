Hiding in the details, however, is a sinister plot to make transgenderism and everything that comes along with it, including child grooming, a constitutional right.\n\nAs far as we know, Nevada is the first state in the country to pass a constitutional amendment like this. It inserts and enshrines LGBT perversion into the same protected category as race, sex, color, creed, disability, ancestry, and national origin.\n\nWhat this means for Nevada is that having a drag queen fetish, being a pedophile, or expressing some other LGBT color of the \u201crainbow\u201d is something a person is born with and cannot change, and that must be protected constitutionally.\n\n\u201cThis is extraordinary,\u201d tweeted one LGBT activist in celebration of the move. \u201cNevada is about to add protections for sexual orientation and gender identity into its constitution. I believe this will be the first state to explicitly do so and they did by popular vote.\u201d\n\nIs election fraud responsible for the passage of Question 1?\n\nSomething that makes little sense with all this is that pre-election polls suggest that Americans of all ages and backgrounds are growing weary of all the LGBT perversion, especially as it pertains to children.\n\nNew York Post reporter and \u201cculture war veteran\u201d Ben Kesslen tweeted a graph \u2013 see below \u2013 that illustrates what he describes as growing \u201canti-trans backlash\u201d across the country.\n\nAs you will notice, the trans acceptance is most prevalent among younger age demographics, presumably because they, too, were groomed at \u201cschool\u201d into accepting sexual deviancy as the norm.\n\nGoing up the age chain, however \u2013 even just into the 30-plus category \u2013 all things LGBT become a lot less popular. People aged 30-44 overwhelmingly believe that American society\u2019s \u201cvalues on gender identity and sexual orientation are changing for the worse.\u201d\n\nEven in the 18-29 age demographic, less than half support the LGBT push. Thirty percent of young people believe that society is changing for the worse with all this, while 20 percent say they have no opinion one way or the other.\n\nIt is important to note that the poll, which was conducted by NBC News in the form of an exit poll, is a bit confusingly worded. So perhaps some people answered it wrongly because of poor reading comprehension?\n\nThe other possibility is that the election itself was rigged to ensure that Question 1 \u201cpassed\u201d with flying colors, even though it does not match the results of exit polling.\n\n\u201cThe simple solution is that everyone should now identify as a woman,\u201d joked a commenter named Jason. \u201cThis makes you eligible for all kinds of stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make any effort for it. Any argument or disagreement they have with you now instantly becomes transphobic and misogynist.\u201d\n\nSomeone responded to this comment that the suggestion is \u201cbrilliant.\u201d We can become a \u201cnation of women\u201d with \u201cno men.\u201d Next, we can self-identify as some other race, especially for those who have light skin, in order to take advantage of all the benefits available specifically and exclusively to non-whites.\n\n\u201cPopular vote is mob rule and not what the constitutional republic United States of America was meant to be,\u201d wrote another commenter. \u201cJust because you can convince 51% of the population of something doesn\u2019t make it legal or lawful or right.\u201d\n\nMore related news about the transgender fixation and obsession sweeping America can be found at Transhumanism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Nevada just voted a law into existence that will make it a CRIME to criticize transgenderism, even for children", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-11-11-nevada-voted-law-crime-criticize-transgenderism-children.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "By a margin of 57.1 percent to 42.9 percent, Nevada voters passed Nevada Question 1, which constitutionally enshrines sexual orientation and gender identity as specially protected classes that cannot be criticized or otherwise discriminated against.
