The event will be over by 5 pm,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cApril is a very busy time for Ft Lauderdale Beach, and this is exactly why this location was chosen,\u201d Nelson wrote. \u201cOur goal is for people to see us and be inspired to join in!\u201d\n\n\u201cSigns are VERY important. Signs with three to six BIG BOLD WORDS are the best. \u201cMASKS ARE SLAVERY. \" \u201cNO MORE MASKS. \" \u201cMASKS OFF CHILDREN. \"\n\n\u201cThis is a non-partisan event but ALL political signs and flags are welcome!\u201d\n\nThe news of the event came after Joe Biden demanded that state and local leaders reimpose mask mandates and halt their efforts to return to normal life.\n\nBiden called on governors to pause their plans to reopen their states as he touted his administration\u2019s efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Biden administration is also working on COVID-19 vaccine passports for Americans to use as proof of vaccination via a scannable code similar to an airline boarding pass.\n\nIn contrast, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he would issue an executive order banning \u201cvaccine passports\u201d from being used by governments and businesses as proof residents have been vaccinated.\n\nDeSantis convened at the state Capitol to sign into law a bill that would ban COVID-related lawsuits against businesses that have made good-faith efforts to comply with coronavirus guidelines.\n\nThe Republican governor said he would also take the additional step of barring businesses from refusing to serve people who can't prove vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe always said we wanted to provide it for all but mandate it for none,\u201d DeSantis said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cAnd that was something that, while it was advised to take particularly if you\u2019re vulnerable, we were not going to force you to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply participate in normal society,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cYou want to go to a movie theater, should you have to show that? No. You want to go to a game, a theme park? No. So we\u2019re not supportive of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to do this and what, give all this information to some big corporation? You want the fox to guard the hen house? I mean, give me a break,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cI think this is something that has huge privacy implications. It is not necessary to do.\u201d\n\nPetition to Stop Rollout of 'Vaccine Passports' Goes Viral", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/Million-Maskless-March-Planned-in-Florida-as-Celebration-of-Freedom.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "\u2018Million Maskless March\u2019 Planned in Florida as 'Celebration of Freedom'", "description": "'April 10 marks one year of mask tyranny' - A new anti-mask protest is being planned by a local Floridian who is calling on residents to marc... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Protest", "coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://freeflorida.me/thread/316-million-maskless-march-mask-burning-in-ft-lauderdale/", "../../news/14705-biden-demands-state-leaders-reimpose-mask-mandates-stop-reopening-efforts", "../../news/14690-biden-admin-working-on-scannable-vaccine-passports", "../../news/14711-florida-gov-desantis-to-ban-covid-vaccine-passports-", "../../news/14371-petition-to-stop-rollout-of-vaccine-passports-goes-viral"], "authors": ["Daniel Newton"], "publish_date": "2021-03-31"}
