Yesterday it was Tomi Lehren [sic] saying she won\u2019t take one,\u201d Flaherty reportedly said in the message to the Facebook staffer, whose name and email address have been redacted.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly why I want to know what \u2018Reduction\u2019 actually looks like\u2014if \u2018reduction\u2019 means \u2018pumping our most vaccine hesitant audience with [T]ucker Carlson saying it doesn\u2019t work\u2019 then \u2026 I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s reduction!\u201d Flaherty continued, per the document shared by Landry.\n\nSignaling action regarding the request, the unidentified Facebook employee then reportedly wrote: \u201cRunning this down now.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times has reached out with a request for comment to Facebook parent Meta, Fox News Channel, and the White House, but no reply was received by publication.\n\nLandry, together with Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, sued the Biden administration in May 2022 for allegedly pressuring and colluding with social media giants to suppress free speech.\n\nSchmitt on Jan. 5 was sworn in as a U.S. senator and has been replaced in his role as Missouri attorney general by Andrew Bailey.\n\nBailey took to Twitter on Jan. 7 to say that when he took the oath of office, he swore he would protect the Constitution and explained \u201cwhy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now have hard evidence that President Biden\u2019s Administration colluded with social media companies to censor differing viewpoints and silence \u2018misinformation\u2019 that was later deemed true,\u201d Bailey wrote in a series of posts.\n\nBailey shared a screenshot of an email from White House COVID-19 Digital Director Clarke E. Humphrey to an unidentified Twitter employee with the subject line \u201cFlagging Hank Aaron misinfo\u201d and requesting the Twitter staff to \u201cget moving on the process for having it removed ASAP.\u201d\n\nIn her request, Humphrey provided a link to a Twitter post by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known critic of the Biden administration\u2019s narrative on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe offending tweet links to an article on the website of the Children\u2019s Health Defense, an activist group chaired by Kennedy Jr. that left-leaning Wikipedia labels as \u201cone of the main sources of misinformation on vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe article, from Jan. 22, 2021, says Aaron died 18 days after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine of an \u201cundisclosed cause\u201d and cites Kennedy Jr. as saying that his \u201ctragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\nAbout a week later, the Fulton County Medical Examiner released Aaron\u2019s cause of death as \u201cnatural causes\u201d and that he didn\u2019t have any COVID-19 symptoms, with his medical history listing prostate issues and hypertension.\n\nBesides requesting action on Kennedy Jr.\u2019s tweet, Humphrey also added a request to \u201ckeep an eye out for tweets that fall in this same genre,\u201d per the screenshot shared by Bailey.\n\nThe Epoch Times has reached out to Twitter with a request for comment.\n\n\u2018The Truth No Longer Matters to the White House\u2019\n\nBailey also shared screenshots of several other messages that he said show collusion between Big Tech and the government to suppress free speech, including another message from Flaherty to an unidentified Facebook employee in which the White House official demands \u201cassurances\u201d that the social media company is taking actions \u201cto ensure you\u2019re not making our country\u2019s vaccine hesitancy problem worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth no longer matters to the White House,\u201d Bailey captioned the post.\n\n\u201cThese emails confirm what we\u2019ve known all along,\u201d Bailey wrote. \u201cThe Biden Admin. has been colluding with social media companies to stifle opposing voices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will continue to push back against this blatant attack on the 1st Amendment with every tool at my disposal,\u201d he added.\n\nWith Schmitt gone as attorney general, Bailey has taken his place as a plaintiff in the lawsuit against President Joe Biden, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and other administration officials.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Biden and other government officials worked with Big Tech companies like Meta, Twitter, and YouTube to censor conversation around matters relating to everything from COVID-19 and election integrity to the Hunter Biden laptop story, doing so under the guise of battling \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nThe two Republican-led states accuse Biden and other officials named in the lawsuit of \u201cfalsely\u201d attacking the Hunter Biden laptop story as \u201cdisinformation.\u201d\n\nThe story, which was first published by the New York Post in October 2020, detailed the contents of a laptop linked to Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s son. The laptop was abandoned in a Delaware computer repair shop and included compromising pictures and emails regarding allegedly corrupt foreign business deals.\n\nTwitter labeled the story as \u201cpotentially harmful\u201d and locked the New York Post\u2019s main Twitter account while also blocking Twitter users from publishing the link to the story.\n\nGOP to Investigate \u2018Weaponization of the Federal Government\u2019\n\nIt comes as House Republicans have pledged to investigate allegations of collusion between federal agencies and private companies, and to do so, they\u2019re looking to establish a subcommittee on the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the federal government.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 The U.S. Regime Made Me A Non-Person\n\u2022 THE TWITTER FILES: How Twitter Rigged The Covid Debate", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "AGs Slam White House Over Multiple Examples Of Big Tech Collusion To Censor Dissent", "description": "Originally published by ZeroHedge At least two state Attorneys General have\u00a0slammed the White House for colluding with social media companies...", "url": "https://southfront.org/ags-slam-white-house-over-multiple-examples-of-big-tech-collusion-to-censor-dissent/", "site_name": "South Front", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontEnTwo", "article:published_time": "2023-01-09T12:18:41+00:00", "image": "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tucker-2.jpg", "image:width": "700", "image:height": "420", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://southfront.org/donate/", "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/tucker%202.jpg?itok=_ZhWU82x", "https://www.zerohedge.com/political/ags-slam-white-house-over-multiple-examples-big-tech-collusion-censor-dissent", "https://twitter.com/AGAndrewBailey/status/1611568546030522370?s=20", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/white-house-pushed-facebook-to-censor-tucker-carlson-on-covid-19-vaccines-ag-landry_4968830.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/white-house-pushed-facebook-to-censor-tucker-carlson-on-covid-19-vaccines-ag-landry_4968830.html", "https://twitter.com/AGJeffLandry/status/1611509683818270720?s=20&t=Sqso0aZlPmq_ivDdOilpgQ", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/2-gop-led-states-sue-biden-administration-for-pressuring-and-colluding-with-big-tech-to-censor-free-speech_4449673.html", "https://twitter.com/SenateGOP/status/1611054228092424197?s=20&t=sNOXoxiKCpMThiFDyjJ_1w", "https://twitter.com/AGAndrewBailey/status/1611568518612254722?s=20&t=3BpLOvLQgOqhit7yIGdj8g", "https://twitter.com/AGAndrewBailey/status/1611568520990539776?s=20&t=3BpLOvLQgOqhit7yIGdj8g", "https://twitter.com/AGAndrewBailey/status/1611568529140064256?s=20&t=3BpLOvLQgOqhit7yIGdj8g", "https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1352748139665645569", "https://twitter.com/AGAndrewBailey/status/1611568562048765954?s=20&t=3BpLOvLQgOqhit7yIGdj8g", "https://twitter.com/AGAndrewBailey/status/1611568573603893248?s=20&t=3BpLOvLQgOqhit7yIGdj8g", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/republicans-plan-to-start-a-committee-to-probe-weaponization-of-the-federal-government_4958635.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/white-house-pushed-facebook-to-censor-tucker-carlson-on-covid-19-vaccines-ag-landry_4968830.html", "https://southfront.org/the-u-s-regime-made-me-a-non-person/", "https://southfront.org/censorship-prohibits-spreading-truths-and-demands-spreading-lies/", "https://southfront.org/the-twitter-files-how-twitter-rigged-the-covid-debate/", "https://southfront.org/donate/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-01-09T12:18:41+00:00"}
