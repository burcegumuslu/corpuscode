On the way to Luxor Temple, the procession stopped at six different shrines from the reign of Hatshepsut who left us the first artistic representation of the festival. We know that these six shrines contain statues of the king, in the form of Osiris. So just like the festivals, which had taken place earlier in the month, the opet festival was part of the Grand overarching narrative of Osiris worship that happened in the first few months of the year. Even if it was dedicated mostly to the king. It couldn\u2019t ignore Oh, Cyrus, the statues of the king, as Osiris, were greeted by the statues of our moon and company, the priests made offerings at each shrine before continuing on their way. Eventually, they reached the great Luxor temple itself. There, the king and the priests made offerings to the Royal car, the essence of vitality and the spirit of kingship. In other words, they work to revitalize the king\u2019s divine energy to make him powerful and potent for the year ahead.\n\nHi, everybody, I\u2019m your host, Isaac. We\u2019re gonna start revealing the truth about queueing on the movement called queueing on what\u2019s it all about? Well, it\u2019s a cya. I\u2019ll tell you that. This is going to be like when I did the flat earth analysis, sort of. I didn\u2019t go as in depth on this one I just found, because I didn\u2019t look I\u2019ve never bought into the QA non stuff. I think it\u2019s a sign up from the jump. But much like the flat earth stuff, if you\u2019re a QA non person, you\u2019re welcome here. I\u2019m not here to tell you you\u2019re stupid. No, you are. Not just kidding. No, there\u2019s there\u2019s reasons for people to believe the QA non thing. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m entirely right, and you should always listen to me. I\u2019m just giving you my opinion here. Okay. This is an op ed. Pretty sure I\u2019m right, though. I think QA non is a psyop. And we\u2019ll discuss this theory over the next couple, two, three episodes. Today\u2019s part one and we\u2019re going to talk about America\u2019s secret destiny, this resurrection of Osiris ritual and how it all fits into this QA non conspiracy. We\u2019re gonna get into a lot of cool stuff if you like pagan illuminate of confirm occult symbolism, if you like all that stuff, the history of America we\u2019re gonna we\u2019re gonna carve out some ideas and fit together a theory that I would argue is very possible. Now, let\u2019s talk about QA. Now, if you don\u2019t know who the QA none, is, it\u2019s what I think to be the deification of Trump. Donnie T. If you go to, let\u2019s say, let\u2019s go to Wikipedia. You know, you can trust a Wikipedia. They say QA Don is a far right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles running a global child sex trafficking ring is plotting against President Donald Trump who is battling them, leading to a day of reckoning involving the mass arrest of journalists and politicians. No part of the theory is based on fact. Well, of course Wikipedia would say that. Although I\u2019m going to keep reading, although proceeded by similar viral conspiracies, such as pizza gate, the theory proper began with an October 2017 post on the anonymous image board 4chan by Q, who is presumably an American individual, but most likely has become a group of people who claim to have access to classified information involving the Trump administration and its opponents in the United States. NBC News found that three people took the original cube post and expanded it across multiple media platforms to build internet followings for profit. QA non was preceded by several similar anonymous 4chan posters, such as FBI a non h Li, a non CIA eignen so on and so forth. I\u2019m going to read you a little bit more because it\u2019s relevant. Q is accused many liberal Hollywood actors, Democratic politicians and high ranking officials of being members of the Cabal who also claimed that Trump feigned conspiracy with Russians to enlist Robert Mueller to join him in exposing the ring and preventing a coup d\u2019etat by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and George Soros. Q is a reference to the Q clearance used by the US Department of Energy. QA nonbelievers commonly tagged their social media posts with the hashtag hashtag ww g one WG A signifying the motto where we go one we go all. And basically you\u2019ll find lots of overlap between the Trump rallies. Trump followers, supporting the QA non stuff wearing the cue patches. I think even old Trump Jr. posted on his Instagram, some QA non stuff. And you\u2019ll see all these hashtag take the oath. Trust the trust the plan? Well, you\u2019ve been trusting the plan for four years and the storm, the Great Awakening, I guess, is in process. That\u2019s the very, and this is classic disinformation psyop, where you get a little bit of truth to cloud The, the mixture to make you believe the whole thing is true. Are there? I mean, let\u2019s go back to the roots of the theory before I get into all the cool occult, Osiris mystery stuff. The pizza gate emails, right? Those were pretty curious. And it was super curious how nobody researched what those coded languages mean. So to me, I get that I think those are strange. I think that the journalists, the mainstream media should be researching what all those coded words mean, in the leaked emails. But they never did it. That\u2019s their job and they never really did it. They just hurried up and said all this is fake news is conspiracy fake news. Snopes says it\u2019s always fake news right off the bat. Snopes to two weirdos in Washington state or something. That\u2019s Snopes. You can trust two weirdos right now they also believe in a secret cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles running a global child sex trafficking earring. And I think all that is true, right? I mean, you got the Franklin cover up. You got all Sandusky, you got that old Epstein. So again, not necessarily wrong. But as you\u2019ll hear in my theory, this is classic psyop disinformation, they give you a little bit of truth to get you reaching out over the edge and then you know, but the the end game isn\u2019t true. That\u2019s my take on it. We\u2019re going to look at some of the occult ideas with the leaders of America. Our presidents going back to the pagan Mystery Schools, the founding fathers, some, some rituals by the Freemasons, they get conducted every inauguration. Did you know about the rituals, the raising of Osiris ritual, every president gets it. Then in part two, we\u2019re going to go up to 2016. And look at the occult influence of Pepe the Frog to get Donnie t in the office with the sigil magic charging up the sigil magic from the 4chan nerds. Steve Bannon, which you\u2019ve heard my interview with Professor Ben Tuttle bomb, he did a whole book he was hanging out with Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon is a traditionalist. He\u2019s an occultist. Basically, they believe there\u2019s a final cycle that we\u2019re in the Kali Yuga, but the destructive age, and we need to bring this all down so we can rebuild it with their psychotic, dystopian future would be a utopia for them a dystopia for us. And then I plan on having a third show. I\u2019ve had a guest who says he can reveal some truths about the Q movement as well. So we\u2019re gonna try to bang all these out a three part arc. And it\u2019s gonna be a good time. So join me my friends now. You love housekeeping. You love the housekeeping. I\u2019ve got a, I\u2019ve got a couple things to talk to you about. I got a Patreon.

And then I will have once the paperback is live, I will have the signed paperbacks at my gumroad store. gumroad like bubblegum gumroad.com backslash Isaac W, check out all those signed paperbacks you can get? I\u2019ve even got a free download of the vaccine controversy, a full 80 page analysis asking, Are vaccines safe and effective? And you already know the answer. But it\u2019s a non and it was a non biased exploration. I don\u2019t know if you heard all I did like seven or eight parts of this thing back in March because I saw the writing on the wall that COVID vaccines will be enforced. So check it out and get that book for free. Go get it for free. Oh yeah, it was banned from Amazon. Amazon banned it blocked it would not allow me to release it. I\u2019ve never had that happen before. And I write books about the Illuminati blood sacrifices of the devil than the buck vaccines. No, no, no. And follow me on Instagram. I got beautiful photos of my beautiful dogs. Check out my progress photos of my CrossFit and macros diet. Drinking white claws do an Instagram lives all that stuff. instagram.com backslash Isaac Weishaupt. But XM, buddy. Yeah. And I\u2019ll have links to all this crap in the show notes. So yeah, there we go. That\u2019s all I got. Okay, take it easy. Everyone crying about how long my intros are. Guess what my show? Maybe I\u2019ll make a 15 minute intro and a 10 minute show. If you don\u2019t like it, suck it. Go. Go listen to Alex Jones. He\u2019ll tell you that. Q is God. I bought. I bought a I\u2019m doing a show with Jay Dyer. Who\u2019s uh, and look much loved Alex Jones. I\u2019m a big, I don\u2019t listen to Alex Jones. But like, when he was on a tinfoil hat and Joe Rogan, like it\u2019s the best. He\u2019s great. But I\u2019m not I\u2019m more open minded than most. I\u2019m okay. Like, just because I disagree with Alex Jones. Like, that\u2019s fine. Like that\u2019s what this truth or community is about. We all have our different takes on things are different theories. It\u2019s all one brotherhood or sisterhood. Everyone\u2019s Welcome to the table in my opinion. And we\u2019re all here trying to just figure it out. We\u2019re all trying to find the truth. And we\u2019re on our own right. But I bought a koozie from the info wars store for this show I\u2019m doing with Jay Dyer. And the because the male penis vitality pills were too expensive. And I didn\u2019t want to show my Boehner on YouTube. The the koozie came with some stickers and it\u2019s one of theirs like 10 stickers and one of them said impeach the Democrats. So what the hell, he\u2019s really amping this up for the election? Right? Because if you recall, he was uh, you know, spreading a lot of this stuff about s hook. about Trump about QA non. I think there\u2019s a lot going on behind the scenes we don\u2019t know about is all I\u2019m gonna say about that. All right, here we go. Let\u2019s get it. Okay. Yeah, that was a long intro. I\u2019m setting you up though. Trying to set you up. This is mean you hanging out? If you have better things to do, go do them. Okay. Take me with you, though. Let\u2019s talk about QA Not now. And I\u2019ve got some sources here. And and look, there\u2019s a proportional length of intro to the show, right? I got, this is gonna be like two or three hours of content. I got to set you up. Give me 10 minutes to set you up. Okay. Here\u2019s the sources I used for a lot of this research if you want to dig in deeper. Like I said, fact check me I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m wrong all the time. Not always. I\u2019m right some of the time. Like my alien prophecies that will be true. The alien spiritualities coming. I\u2019m five to 10 years ahead of time. You\u2019ll read about it in my book. Now the sources I use which the fall brothers I don\u2019t know if you follow them. They got pretty good information. Belly of the Beast was a two or three hour video I got on Vimeo was like 15 bucks. Was it worth it? Yeah, I think so. It\u2019s pretty good. But a lot of information in there. very dense. It was good though. So that was one source. Then Tom Horne wrote a book called a polygon rising 2012 I did not read the whole thing. I got some cliff notes here and there from him. Not from him directly. But he wrote some essays here and there and I got the notes from it because they just Focusing on the fall brothers Belly of the Beast. That\u2019s how I found him. He seems like he\u2019s a sort of, I don\u2019t know. Bible thumping Christian type guy. I don\u2019t know, no clue. Doesn\u2019t matter. The information is the information. I don\u2019t care what package you want to package it up in Plutarch, some old time guy, and part two, we\u2019re gonna get into Pepe the Frog. And I shout out Ben on the Patreon team told me to watch this documentary called feels good man. And it\u2019s all about Pepe the Frog and I bought that on Vimeo. I think it was like 10 to 20 bucks. Was it worth it? Hell yeah. It was great. Alex Jones was in there too, by the way. A great little documentary, though very variant, and I love a good documentary. So that\u2019s, those are all the sources. I mean, there\u2019s there\u2019s way more sources than that. Those are like the main if you want more, go to those things. First, let\u2019s talk about America\u2019s secret destiny. You have to understand what America was founded upon, okay. One of many things, freedom of religion. And it was started for the freedom to practice these occult religions, the Freemasons, the rosicrucians, all these occultists that came over, because they were being oppressed in their home countries. So we gave them a place to set up shop out there and Philly was where a lot of those rosicrucians Conrad von Beisel moved it over to Lancaster there, my hometown. That\u2019s where the, you know, that\u2019s where Ground Zero was over there. Francis Bacon. He said that America was to be the new Atlantis. This is the place you know, because he was a an occultist, very prominent obviously, this is the place where they are to restore the golden age of Osiris, which is very similar to what Steve Mann and talks about with traditionalism restoring this golden age. But my question is always the golden age for who? When there\u2019s a little losers. I don\u2019t know that you can get around that. But the pagan occult mystery religions are clearly represented in Washington, DC and on the Great Seal. None of this is new to you, my dear listener. George Washington said that the New World Order was an ancient hope meant to be fulfilled. I\u2019m sorry, not George Washington, George W. Bush, I put GW in my notes, and I like wait a minute. Okay, so I pulled his inauguration speech in the second to last paragraph. This is like damn, near the end of this inaugural speech he gave, quote, when our founders declared a new order of the ages when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty. When citizens marched and peaceful rage under the banner of freedom now, they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled history as an ebb and flow of justice. But history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the author of liberty. That was a second to last paragraph from his second inaugural speech when he got reelected, of course, referring to the Global War on Terrorism when he talks about the troops being a continuation of the early revolution. So when he says when our founders declared a new order of the ages, when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty, right, he\u2019s saying we\u2019re continuing the great work. And again, I gotta throw a weird little caveat there. I do love our country, right? In fact, I\u2019ve got a Global War on Terrorism metal, but you didn\u2019t know that. Because I have a love hate with the military. Okay, I was in the military active duty for four years. Has this good? It has this bad ultimately wasn\u2019t for me. That 20 year career wasn\u2019t something I was willing to pursue. Because it takes a lot out. It\u2019s a lot of sacrifice. Those men and women put up with a lot of shit. And, you know, there\u2019s uh, anyway, what I\u2019m saying is I do love this country. I\u2019m not I don\u2019t want the listener to get this twisted at all. Someone cue the Star Spangled Banner. I\u2019m just saying we got to keep an eye on things as the people. This government is supposed to be established around the people being informed. This is why free speech is so important. We need voices out there. kicking around Now, I don\u2019t advocate for some lunatic with an assault rifle showing up to the common ping pong looking for the satanic pedophile groups. But we need to at least have a conversation about it right? What are they talking about on those weird emails? No one seems to know. They just tell you don\u2019t don\u2019t listen to those emails. That\u2019s fake news. Now, the the Novus Ordo cichorium, right. You\u2019ve heard this. That\u2019s a pagan doctrine there. And if you check into Tom horns book upali on rising 2012 he, he talks about this. And again, this is an article I read about his book he wrote, as I pointed out, in a Pollyanna rising 2012 Novus Ordo cichorium is derived from the prophecies of the Q means Sibel a prophetess of Apollo. And Apollo is the, the Greek version of the Egyptian god Osiris. So you\u2019ll find that a lot in this research the pagans, transfer the names of the gods and the goddesses around, but Osiris and Apollo are, for all intents and purposes of the same thing. So he\u2019s, he\u2019s talking about Novus Ordo securom is derived from the prophecies of some profit tests of Apollo, who predicted the return of Apollo at a future date, when men would be rejoined by the gods. What\u2019s he saying? He\u2019s basically saying, there was a priestess, much like the Oracle of Delphi, prophesying the return of the reign of Apollo or Cyrus, whatever you want to call it. We\u2019ll call it a Cyrus mostly in this analysis. And I dug a little bit into her story, she had nine books of prophecies that she offered to the last Roman king who refuse because the price was too high. The rent was too damn high. So she was like, Alright, cool. So she burned three of them came back and said, Okay, I got six remaining. I\u2019ll give you six for the same price. You could have paid for the nine. And he was like, no. So she burned three more. She shows up again. So okay, I got three, I got three left. You\u2019re gonna pay the price of the full nine, though. Any bottom like a sucker. And he stored these prophecy books at the temple of Jupiter at the Capitol line Hill in Rome, which will play a part in the story, because we will revisit the Capitol line Hill and Tom Warren, he asserts that this reappearing God in the story is actually Lucifer dodgy he was of the Bible thumping variety. Now, the theory is that the references to Osiris are the same as the references to Lucifer because the prophecies are no Cyrus coming back to have full reign, which is just like the Antichrist discussed in the Holy Bible, that Tom Horne asserts that the Freemasons are trying to manifest this, this whole process, which and you\u2019ll hear this a lot. You\u2019ll hear this often that they\u2019re trying to reenact the whole book of Revelation like a script. Because of a little bit of As above, so below connected to the macro and the micro. It\u2019s almost like they can kickstart the events by starting out the rituals. So Tom Horne, he claims the Freemasons are trying to manifest this whole thing, this whole reign of Lucifer called Osiris, with a ritual that they call the raising ceremony to raise Osiris from the dead, which to make things even more confusing, is also referred to as Hiram abiff. Which is like the, the myth of the origins of Freemasonry, which if you read my book, conspiracy theories, and on popular culture, again, available, Amazon, audible and all that sign copies as well, on the gumroad. I have a section on Harry Potter and the Deathly hollows mythos is the same that\u2019s similar to the mythos of the origins of Freemasonry, and as you already know, JK Rowling already said that the symbol of the definitely hollows came to her as a vision from a free Masonic symbol. So tell me she\u2019s not illuminate, confirm. Now, let\u2019s nerd out a little bit on the myth of Osiris and ISIS, because this plays a role, obviously, right? The Freemasons over there trying to manifest these entities, little Apollo or Osiris or whatever you want to call it or Lucifer or high room with a lot of coded language in these Mystery Schools, right? Because you can go around saying that you want to make Lucifer the head of the world. I have a lot of resistance against that. Oh, Cyrus, on the other hand, maybe not like look at NASA has the Osiris Rex mission. To go out to an asteroid, prove it and bring it back home to verify that life exists outside of Earth. Therefore, aliens therefore, no more religion. So Cyrus was the you know, and a lot of you probably know the myth already of Osiris, but Osiris was killed by set or tython. Sometimes he\u2019s called. And these were like DVDs in ancient Egypt, right? So Osiris was killed by his brother set, cut into 14 pieces. After a rain of 28 years, which was considered a perfected number, based on the renewal of the moon, symbolized as the female cycles, symbolizing regeneration and eternal life. So Cyrus, he had a concert, his his ISIS, ISIS goddess. She went around, she was all sad said, cut them up into so many pieces. She found 13 of them. But one piece was missing, you know which piece was missing the big old phallus so like any good concert she manufactured one she made the world\u2019s first dildo. And they called it an obelisk. So she has a 13 pieces and the obelisk and using magic from another deity called both, which you\u2019ll find in a lot of research into the call like Aster Crowley and such the book of Thoth. She impregnated herself. With this reassembled Franken Osiris and his obelisk gave birth to a child named Horus a divine being created through magic and sexy time with a dead guy. Now in Egypt, they celebrate this myth all over the place, they\u2019ve got the belief that the sun god Ra would energize the obelisk as it traverse the skies at high noon would energize that big obelisk because they would build over there in ancient Egypt. And this energy was used to resurrect Osiris from the underworld so that Osiris could be born again as Horus through the ritual into the the womb of ISIS through the dome, which is why you\u2019ll see a lot of and there\u2019s a lot of symbols related here. So like, you know, obviously, we\u2019re going to talk about the Washington Monument in DC, that mega obelisk, and you only see the obelisk is always across from a reflecting pool, which is a body of water in the water represents the moon goddess. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s sort of like the ice, sort of like Osiris and ISIS and the energy from the sun raw, energizes that obelisk with the idea that magically it can procreate the offspring Horus with the concert of ISIS, they so yeah, like the sun plays the role there and energizes the obelisk. Okay. Now, Pluto mark is an old timey philosopher guy. He asserts that all Cyrus was actually slaughtered by set on the 17th day of the month, which was curious, because, and we\u2019ll get into that a little bit more, but specifically March right, March 17, which was the 77th day of the year. Now what\u2019s curious to me was that croley has Lieber Oz, z. And then of course, you\u2019ve also got the Wizard of Oz. Created by Frank l bomb a noted theosophist and follower love ASCII. Anyway, LIBOR oz means LIBOR 77 which you\u2019ll also find the 77 on the star Babylon multiple times, and this will tie into the queue. In the second part, this will tie into queue because guess which letter of the alphabet q sits at is the 17th letter, plot spoiler, the 17th letter and in numeral numerology, and gematria could tie all together because the official story about QA non is that q represents the security clearance in the Department of Energy. That seems a little weird. Yeah, Let\u2019s dig in a little bit more talking about blood bansky and croley and 77 and oz and all this stuff. Because 77 appears on the star Babylon Well, if you read my new book aliens UFOs in the occult user illusion one, you would read this paragraph quote, we\u2019re still talking about this revelation of the method something bill that he started and Crowley finished when he proclaimed to usher in the New Age, the Ayaan of Horus. The idea is that Crowley was presenting we\u2019re not necessarily new. In fact, his symbol of the star of Babylon used for his order of the silverstar group was actually based on an older symbol created by john D in the seal of God. This talisman was used to aid communication with the angels from which john D obtained the nokian language. Now, some of us might think that sound like a bunch of gobbly goo. But what I\u2019m saying is that the symbol of the star of Babylon is based on a symbol john D. Had for the seal of God, which john D used to find the language and dictate the language with which we could communicate with extraterrestrials entities, gods, demons, angels, whatever. So I think that all these things have a few degrees of separation. I think we\u2019re all connected here. That\u2019s my view. That\u2019s my filter on this whole thing. Now let\u2019s dig into March 17. A little bit how do we know Cyrus really died on the 17th of March? Well, because and I want to establish this because it comes up later on part two, I think maybe the end of part one here. If you look to Pluto marks, morels theosophical essays on Isis and Osiris, you would read this following exciting extract. Quote, on the 17th day of the month took place as the Egyptians fable the death of Osiris, on which day, the full moon being completed becomes most conspicuous, on which the account the pythagoreans called the day, anti fractus precaution and generally abomination that particular number for 16 being a square number, and 18 having signs of unequal length which alone of the integral numbers have the peculiarity of possessing external measurements equal to the areas contained by them. One the 17 intruding hedges off and destroys them from one another and distracts the proportion of one to eight because it\u2019s self cut up into unequal parts. I think that\u2019s a long way of saying that 17 is a prime number. Whereas like, 16 would be a perfect number. It\u2019s square. But yeah, anyway, point being Plutarch said on the 17th day of the month, Osiris was killed 17 is in fact important to this whole narrative about raising Osiris. Because everything is numbers and rituals and dates to these people. Now, let\u2019s get back to Tom Horne\u2019s theory about the raising a little Syrah ceremony ritual, which again, I can\u2019t confirm besides his studies in his research, unfortunately, it\u2019s the most important part of the story. Now the US presidential inauguration that happens every four years. He claims that there\u2019s a secret ceremony to reincarnate the god Osiris, into the body of an American president. So that the New World Order and the you know, secret destiny of America could all come to fruition, the Golden Age, the New World Order, the Novus Ordo SCORM, all these things. And let\u2019s, in fact, I\u2019ll let the man himself tell you right here, quote, and I\u2019ll try to remember to put these links in the show notes. Because I care. This is from news with views, calm. Quote, if the DC diagram is interpreted based on the classical and fixed meaning of the combined symbols and beliefs of the designers, not only did the metaphysicians among America\u2019s founders who had control of the capitals, layout plan, a city in honor of the return of Apollo and Osiris Apollo slash Osiris, excuse me, because again, it\u2019s the same entity, right? So they\u2019re saying that laid out dc in honor of the return of Apollo slash Osiris and the dawn of his new golden pagan age. The civils prophecy on the greatest seal that goes back to that priestess with a Novus Ordo secure. But the blueprint and DC and the rituals conducted by Freemasons, both modern and historic illustrate a high degree of operational magic intended to bring the prophecy about. The sole purpose of the rituals and these constructs is to raise the spirit of Osiris from the underworld into human form. This incarnation of Osiris is parodied in the house of the temple, the Hara dome, that\u2019s the that\u2019s the place where the 33rd degree Freemasons meet in DC, which is Oh, by the way, directly north in line with the Washington Monument. Look it up on the map. In fact, maybe I\u2019ll put some images on the Instagram. Let me make a note for you. Photo of map on instagram.com backslash Isaac Weishaupt and tell them to like and subscribe they will love it okay. So the in this incarnation of Osiris is parodied in the house of the temple, the Hara dome, during changes in US presidents, just as they were in the ancient Egyptian ritual of raising Osiris into the Pharaoh. But the ritual and we\u2019ll go deeper into this if you\u2019re getting lost hanging, but but the ritual in DC is rehearsed in anticipation of a moment, a greater moment in time when the literal physical Return of the entity Apollo slash Osiris will give birth to the Novus Ordo. So korum think of the rituals in the house of the temple as a warm for antichrist actual Second Coming. Now, I told you Tom Horne seems to be more of the bible thumper, Christian variety, right or wrong. And I would argue that his book upali on 2012 there. I think they were they were thinking Obama was going to be the Antichrist. Maybe not I don\u2019t like I said, I didn\u2019t read the book. That\u2019s just my wild guess. Just like he was going to bring about the the jihad in America. Remember all that? Let\u2019s finish up his writing here. To assure that the arrival of Apollo slash Osiris will not be impeded by the influence of Christianity, which so many of America\u2019s citizens have been devoted to since the country\u2019s founding. The last symbol Bible was placed in a magic binding square inside the quote testes of the DC obelisk of Osiris, which is the Washington Monument. According to the occultism, this binding utility is meant to restrain the Bible\u2019s influence while allowing the seat of Osiris to materialize is some wild stuff, folks, I\u2019m telling you. Now, Tom Horne claims that he asked directly the 33rd degree Freemasons down there at the Hara dome, and they refused to talk about the ritual. It\u2019s all about using this last symbol of DC to incarnate Osiris into the body of a president, it doesn\u2019t really matter who I\u2019m sure they pick certain bloodlines or something to someone that\u2019s more receptive to create this Osiris thing, the whole risk. But it\u2019s the apotheosis, or resurrection of the spirit of Osiris, a resurrection of the spirit of the gods. This is why the inauguration happens in the dome, the womb of ISIS to rebirth the candidate as it faces the obelisk of the Washington Monument, the giant phallus. I\u2019m going to go into this this this ritual here soon, in case you\u2019re lost. And what set this all up like I told you earlier, you got to watch the fall brothers Belly of the Beast. Tom Horne was on there, they interviewed him and he was explaining the Egyptian rituals of the festival Oh pet. Which I looked up and he\u2019s right. He\u2019s true. It\u2019s all true. The festival VOCA in ancient Egypt, they were trying to manifest the spirit of Osiris into each of the pharaohs while the pharaoh would stand inside the dome, which is the ISIS womb, because they were trying to transmogrify from manda God, the apotheosis, the pharaoh would go into the dome as a man then through ritual. The obelisk withdraws the powers of Osiris from the underworld and impregnate the dome of ISIS. Then, that man would become God and walk out and now he\u2019s gone. He is the the Horus the resurrected Osiris, inside the belly of ISIS, the magicians of Egypt, and we know these guys had significant occult power, because when Moses goes down to face the pharaoh to say, let me know People go, they actually were able to recreate almost all of the miracles that God performed. You know, as Moses was standing there with his chef, so we know these guys had supernatural power, they recite the original raising of Osiris ceremony, while the pharaoh is standing inside of the dome. We we don\u2019t know what exactly the language around that is, but we know it was preserved in the Mystery Schools and across town from where we\u2019re standing right now with the Hara dome, they claim that they continue to have this important language, the spells the incantation for the raising of Osiris, well, they would conduct that ceremony while the pharaoh is standing there. The seed of Osiris would be drawn up from out of the underworld through the testes of the obelisk, it would magically emit into the ever pregnant belly of ISIS. And Pharaoh would become transmogrified. He entered into the building a man, he comes out of the building, he has a God, and all of Egypt celebrates because now they have divine representation. Now fast forward to this present day, the Freemasons openly admit that they ovilus the dome. Well, again, it\u2019s on the Library of Congress website. These are structures designed and dedicated to all of the ancient pagan gods. But how many Americans know that at the inauguration of every American president, while he is standing over here in the dome, the pregnant belly of ISIS, looking out across the mall at the ovilus over here, in the distance, that across town at the Hara DOM, the headquarters of the Scottish Rite, Freemasonry 33rd degree, they are conducting the raising of a Cyrus ceremony in anticipation of the day, that literally the spirit of Osiris, or who the Greeks would call Apollo is going to rise up out of the underworld to become incarnate in a future American president, who will take his rightful place according to the prophecy on the Great Seal of the United States, which both Franklin Delano Roosevelt his vice president Henry Wallace wrote about Wallace wrote about it in his biography, that he convinced Roosevelt I think he was trying to take credit, but that he convinced Roosevelt that the prophecy on the greatest seal of the United States, the Novus portals, a quorum was on a sonic prophecy, pointing to a date in the future, when the United States would rise up to take its rightful place, as the capital of the New World Order, the fulfillment of the sibling prophecy that says what? That Apollo is going to rise up from out of the underworld, take his place in a man and give birth to a new golden pagan age, literally, the generator to make that happen is what we are standing in the middle of today doing this recording. I wanted to explain this a little bit better. I certainly didn\u2019t understand the whole inauguration process. But let\u2019s talk about the immigration process here. I actually watched some of the Donald Trump inauguration from 2017. It\u2019s 11 hours long. By the way, I didn\u2019t watch the whole thing clearly. curious enough. And I\u2019ll put this photo on Instagram too. Why not? curious enough some of the comments at the very top, like without even scrolling down this video. There were two comments about Trump being the chosen by God to run this country. That\u2019s what the commenters were saying. That\u2019s what they believe. deification of man, my friends. Now the process is this on January 20th, after the election, at high noon has to be at high noon. Again, this is and this is this is the process. They do it every year, this or every four years this way. And they do it a high noon, because again, you got to go back to the sun god of raw with maximum solar energy, got to wake up that big obelisk. And you know, and they do this, even if it\u2019s the same president who by the way, every four years, they do this ritual. And in fact, what\u2019s curious what I found curious was if the if January 20, lands on a Sunday, they do the ritual, this whole inauguration process in private, and then do a public version of it the next day, which is curious, right? Why go through this thing twice? If there wasn\u2019t some symbolic ritual element to it. It doesn\u2019t make sense, does it? Now the ritual is called out in the constitution right? And it only requires when you get a new president, the inauguration. Here\u2019s the only thing that requires the presidential oath. Have authored office. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only thing called out in the Constitution. Now traditionally, the oath is taken at the Capitol building at noon at high noon. And that\u2019s all it really calls for. But, you know, over time, that\u2019s kind of more to now they do parades and all this stuff. In fact, things have changed over the years I found and curious enough. Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 inauguration was the first to do the ceremony out of the west side of the Capitol building, which doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, right? If you look on the on the map, bird\u2019s eye view, the west side of the Capitol Building, faces the Washington Monument, the phallus, the obelisk. Now, this is curious that Reagan would make this move because he was an occultist, he attended a bohemian grove. He had the astrologer their way into this stuff, Manley p Hall, all that stuff. And for many years, they since 81, they\u2019ve really made some changes, like the ad parades, where and this whole thing where the President walks from the Capitol building to the White House. If you recall us when george bush was getting egged, there\u2019s like music and festivities and it\u2019s all this whole pageant for your app. And while you\u2019re looking at the bird\u2019s eye view of the Capitol Building facing the monument, and you look north from the monument to the Hara dome, you\u2019ll notice that the Capitol building is the owl it looks exactly like an owl, Minerva, wisdom, goddess of wisdom. And if you\u2019ll pass the Washington Monument, you\u2019ll see the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool because again, every obelisk has this feminine counterpart. The part of the ritual that matters here is the dome of the Capitol building, which is the dome of ISIS, much like the pharaohs stood inside of when the Syrian mystery rituals were conducted. And of course, the Washington Monument is curious because 555 feet above ground, that\u2019s 6660 inches curious number. Also 55 feet is the number as the square basis 55 feet 660 inches. Tom Warren claims it\u2019s 55 and a half feet, which makes it 666 inches. Very curious. Right. And another claim is that there\u2019s 555 feet above ground and there\u2019s 111 feet below ground to stabilize it for like a retaining wall. 666 feet. Now, I told you, we talked about the history of Capitol Hill. There\u2019s a guy named Pierre Charles lay on font while and what\u2019s curious, okay. Pierre was not amazing. Okay, first off, and Washington was the one who picked this guy Pierre will call cuz I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m pronouncing that last name right les les in fault. He was fired in 1792. He was designing this whole thing. So who cares? He got fired. Anyway, this guy was chosen Pierre, to construct the capital of the US, Washington DC. And he called it the District of Columbia. Because the origin is the Goddess semiramis from the Mesopotamian Babylonian cultures, which was the first goddess then it was ISIS in Egypt. And Colombia is just another version of this kind of like the Apollo Osiris connection. And I\u2019m sure like, if you want to split hairs, like there\u2019s differences, but like, if you\u2019re trying to understand this whole occult Illuminati agenda, that\u2019s kind of the idea. goddesses are to be called upon evoked archetypes, all that stuff. So the district of The Goddess is Washington DC, based upon Columbia being the Goddess. Now, Thomas Jefferson, I don\u2019t know if you saw Hamilton or not, she was actually great. I hate musicals, but\n\nVery good. Thomas Jefferson, who was in the show as well, he didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t include any of this. By the way. He insisted that the Congress house be called Capitol Hill because it comes from Latin and the Roman Empire. It\u2019s associated with Capitol line Hill in Rome. What\u2019s capitalized Hill in Rome? Well, it had its place where they have this complex of monuments to the Roman pagan gods, they have the temple of Jupiter, the temple of Saturn. And of course, Thomas Jefferson took over this hole, because originally and you can find this on the.gov website about the formation of the layout of our capital city, Washington, DC. And it was like a contest. They looked at all the drawings, they\u2019re like, they\u2019re a bunch of idiots. Jefferson\u2019s like, let me do this. And you can see right on the.gov website, it clearly says that he wanted to make a Roman pantheon of for the pagan gods represented in our capital. Jefferson was not a Christian. Not at all. He made his own version of the Bible, he tore out most of the pages. And I think you can still buy it as the fall brothers claim that you can still buy that in DC, the Jefferson Bible. None of those founding but they were deists. And I think some of the theories are that they put on this show of being a Christian to get the popular vote. Sounds very familiar to me. Capitol line Hill and Rome was also known as mons subterraneous, dedicated to Saturn. And it was considered the most sacred site in all of Rome, which had a lot of sacred sites by the way. mons, of course, being the operative word here. Like the mons pubis, mons actually means the high part. So they wanted the capital line Hill to be like the monster attorneys. They\u2019re the mons pubis, and then put the big old Washington obelisk out of the mons pubis.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nIs that something you probably didn\u2019t want to picture in your head? Nothing. Now the story and it get I\u2019m telling you, it gets deep. It goes deep, homeboy. The story is that a skull was found on this hill in Rome, when they were erecting a temple to Saturn could put. And if you listen to David ickes lectures, which I had for many, many years, he\u2019s one of my red pill sources. He talked about the capital line he\u2019ll put means death, put means head. So the skull is, of course, represented here. And the head was of a valuable person, a sacrifice, perhaps, and the hill, capital line hilke. Put line Hill was validated with a prophetic importance as a place that was indestructible and eternal. And this Roman site for all these pagan monuments was important because it was also a place where they decided to do lots of executions, there was a cliff, overlooking the Roman Forum, and the cliff was called the tarpeian rock, named after the virgin who was punished to jump off of it. for betraying the Roman authorities. So if you were executed to jump off this cliff, it was a shameful thing. Because the typical method of execution was strangulation. So jumping from the rock was only for the worst. So of course, everyone wants to stand around and watch. Much like if you saw midsummer, they did theirs as a sort of ritual for the villages to keep the age of the village low. But based on a Roman execution spot at the Capitol line Hill, which they found significance because of the skull, they found when they were trying to build the temple of Saturn. So Pierre gets fired because he\u2019s an idiot, or Jefferson didn\u2019t like his lack of pagan wokeness. And they appointed Dr. William Thornton to be the architect. And then a couple of other architects make some tweaks over time, like the dome, put on top by Thomas Walter, an alleged Freemason. I looked it up apparently, he\u2019s an actual bricklaying Mason on Wikipedia. And Phoenix masonry.org claims he\u2019s the real deal member of the Columbia lodge 91 in Philly. So they put this dome which wasn\u2019t there. Originally, they put the dome on the Capitol building, which is the womb of ISIS. And the Capitol Building was the first build and it was done with a ceremony ritual where George Washington and all these masons laid the cornerstone I believe there\u2019s a famous painting wood on the inside of that dome, you will see the painting of the apotheosis of Washington, painted on the inner Oculus, next to the statue of freedom. On the top of the dome, that you can see from the outside, placed in 1863, weighing 15,000 pounds cast iron. Now the statue of freedom on top of the dome is a another goddess. And she faces the rising sun in the east, based on again the Colombian goddess for the District of Columbia, or ISIS. And the goddess personification that inspired Christopher Columbus to get over here to the promised land, and the name meanings colomba or dove. So Columbus, is where that comes from. And David Ike asserts that the Sumerians goddess from Babylon, was depicted as a dove, which is true. You look that up, which is why in Rome, they worship the Venus Colombo or Venus the dove. Now that apotheosis of Washington, what\u2019s that all about? Well, it\u2019s the first attempt to deify a founding father, because again, you got to look at the secret destiny of America and the occult basis on which we were founded. And it shows him surrounded by 13 maidens that represents the 13 colonies, which is curious, right, because we talked about the story of Osiris and ISIS. ISIS only found the 13 pieces, much like the 13 colonies, which are the 13 maidens on the apotheosis of Washington. And on the banding, there\u2019s a bunch of Roman pagan goddesses and Gods all around them, and he was supposed to originally be buried. George Washington was supposed to be buried underneath in the crypt. Just like an Egyptian pharaoh being buried in his temple so that he could be resurrected into the afterlife. He has the goddess of liberty to his right holding the fast sigh. That\u2019s the bundle of sticks with an axe represents the power of government as seen in the House of Representatives. Which is where the term fascism comes from, by the way, fascism, more. Today\u2019s meaning is more of an authoritarian nationalists like Hitler, Mussolini, both had this weird divine right to rule mentality. And the maidens, the 13 maidens, the 13 colonies, they hold 13 pieces of the Osiris, right? The maidens are holding a phrase E Pluribus Unum, which means out of many one, which is also on the Great Seal right next to the Novus orosa quorum, which means new order of the ages supposed to mean the out of the 13 colonies, one nation emerges. Fun fact, you\u2019ll never see this because visiting the dome isn\u2019t for the public. You can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s only if you\u2019re a member of Congress, can you go inside and look at that painting. Now some claimed that in 2017, a ritual was to take place of a female nude goddess facing the giant, the Washington Monument. And I dug a little bit into this because I found it curious at first, but it looks like this group puts together an event like this every year in DC for cathartic healing. It\u2019s called catharsis on the Mall. They have like little cuddle groups and creative dance and I\u2019m sure they have like those gestures, flipping the devil sticks and then it culminates with a Burning Man type thing, kind of like the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove. Back in 2017, this group was going to create a statue of a 45 foot tall, naked woman called our evolution. And it was going to be up there from November 10 to march 7 2018. Of course. Now I was curious because this placement would have coincided with Trump\u2019s inauguration. Again, the election happened on November 8, confirmed on November 9, inauguration January 20 2017. So the dates were curious. Never happened though the National Park Service denied application on grounds it would destroy the turf cause quite a political TIFF because it was viewed as a liberal feminist thing which clearly it was on some levels, right. So just in case you get researching into this, that\u2019s a rabbit hole that some people ran with a little too far. But you know, there\u2019s And curious elements there. Now, let\u2019s get into QA non. That\u2019s what you\u2019re here for. Let\u2019s get into it a little bit. And then we\u2019re going to conclude the QA and stuff on part two. But let\u2019s lay some foundations for that. Q movement could be part of the deification of Trump as the Osiris that\u2019s the argument I\u2019m going to present. Now looking at q and the official origins, you got to go to 4chan, which is basically some anonymous forum. A person calling themselves Q, claiming to be close to Donnie T. had knowledge of all of his opponents and said there was an agenda to bring down the satanic Deep State child abusers there\u2019s a ton more and I never fully follow this movement. So I mean, you could probably dig in as deep as you want to it\u2019s quite the quit the rabbit hole which you\u2019ll see those q tags the WWE one w ga on everyone\u2019s stuff. I know I know because a ton of my followers they\u2019re on Twitter and Instagram. I see it I look at your profiles. I see it even Donnie Jr. Like I said had it on his ID and they were supported with various things this made people such as myself even but think well maybe there\u2019s some to this you got the Wiener gate laptop thing. You got the pizza gate emails, you got Hollywood\u2019s incessant abuse of kids. You got the adrenochrome stuff, which is in the aliens book, by the way aliens UFOs and they call us illusion one got a little section on adrenochrome how that fits into all this. Jordan say there was a guy who said that Sam Tripoli\u2019s friends pedo I don\u2019t know if you saw that Twitter beef. Truth or drama is always truth or drama. was curious enough I saw him on the documentary above majestic using the term as above so below, so who\u2019s illuminate confirm now Jordans ether. And he was uh, you know, he was pushing. He\u2019s a queue guy, right? He was pushing this idea that drinking the bleach cures COVID. And this, and I dug into that it was a miracle. It\u2019s called the miracle mineral supplement back in 2006. And some scientologist guy said that this bleach cured HIV and the flu and all kinds of stuff. So it\u2019s not really a new thing. But Scientologists will get you going. Now my beef was Q, I\u2019m sure as you can tell by now. I have beef with Q is the cryptic messages. They\u2019re never clear. They\u2019re anonymous, first off, but they\u2019re never clear about what\u2019s going to happen when it\u2019s gonna happen. And it\u2019s like 10% of the time it might actually happen. And then it was like, Oh, my God, oh, my God, it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s been four years. First of all, when\u2019s this big and diamond dropping? I don\u2019t foresee it happening. The experts are claiming that Q is turning into a religious movement or called based on groupthink. That buys into anything presented by Q. This is why no, this is not a truth movement. Because real truth is our lone wolves were free thinking independent people. Look at the big voices behind the Q movement. Were they triggers before? More they listen to a podcast called QA non anonymous. When I was researching for adrenochrome. Obviously, they\u2019ve got q in the title. I mean, very, very clearly, it\u2019s what it is. They can\u2019t even pronounce David\u2019s name correctly. I\u2019ll let you listen. I sort of in my own self hatred as a Jew, I sort of understand how enough people can get together and point the finger you know and, and, and make us seem like, you know, evil, evil guys.\n\nWell, you know, this kind of conspiracy theory is not new. It\u2019s not new to cue. People have linked this practice to ancient blood rituals and the Illuminati. There\u2019s a fantastic documentary by some random YouTube guy called J. Meyers. It\u2019s about 10 minutes long. That\u2019s my\n\nhe\u2019s got some amazing interviews with like, pre q anon people describing the phenomenon when they torture the children, because there\u2019s a physical reaction at the end of morphogens in your body to just increase because of the terror and the pain. So when the Satanists drink the blood, they actually get like a chemical with you know, a high like a drug high from the blood of a tortured victim. Oh,\n\nthey do. entities are feeding off human energy. And one of the things that they do is when they\u2019re sacrificing somebody, the people with invisible light the Satanists, the bloodlines, they\u2019ll drink the blood because when the terror reaches a certain point in the ritual, a certain adrenaline goes into blow which gives these people are high. I mean, sick is not the word. But on another level and energetic level. The entities are feeding off the energy coming off of terror and fear. Yeah, and the gin, the gin, the gin demon feeds. What I\n\nfucking love about that guy is first of all that guy is is just an old I believe he\u2019s an automobile like TV show guy like he\u2019s just nothing to do with anything. Anyways, let\u2019s keep in mind, this guy\u2019s David Eck, who introduced the moon matrix theory in his 2010 book, human race, get off your knees, the Lion Sleeps no more, in which it suggests that the earth and collective human mind are manipulated from the moon, which is a spacecraft and\n\ninterdimensional portal controlled by the reptilians. Now the reason I\u2019m doing this show is this is going to be a huge deal in the coming weeks. The ABCs, I\u2019ve been labeling this as domestic terrorism, associating the entire truth are movement with it. No doubt, they\u2019ll be trying to shut down more truth or avenues. Again, like I always say, you have to sign up for my email list, go to Illuminati watcher.com, backslash start, sign up for my email list, I own that I pay for that every month. That\u2019s my last ditch effort in case they shut down the podcast. They shut down my YouTube, then they shadow ban me on Google. Hopefully that\u2019s where it ends. But if it doesn\u2019t, you know, they\u2019re going to remove the podcast. And then that\u2019s the only way you find me. And make it worse. Facebook and Twitter, social media, they join this fight against Q. They\u2019re banning accounts that are q related now. The Apple App Store remove the Q drop app, stoking the martyrdom confirming the conspiracies. I watched this documentary on Netflix. That was basically trying to trying to say that it\u2019s called the social dilemma. And they said, Well, you know, social media is bad or spying on you. And then halfway through it takes this abrupt left turn into and the next thing you know, your your son\u2019s gonna be joining a cult of conspiracy theorist and he\u2019s going to be in prison forever. So I was like, wait a minute, what? How did that? How did that happen? So like, there\u2019s a demonization of conspiracy truth. There\u2019s I don\u2019t know how deep this psyop goes? Or does that mean because then the, to the lay person they think every truth is, is a cue supporter. And I\u2019m here to tell you, this is one truth is not. Now looking at that cue thing, they come with a cue clearance and some top secret clearance with a special access program attached to it. Now q Of course, like I said, 17th letter. And what\u2019s funny is that whenever Donnie t talks about the number 17 q crown, they see supporting the Q conspiracy, because he\u2019s never really denying it right. And recall that I said earlier that Plutarch asserts that Osiris was killed on the 17th day of the month. In March, technically, the 77th day of the year, they were oz lever, 77, Star Babylon, all that stuff, remember that. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll tie Q into the conclusion. And I do want to crystals from the secret son blog. He\u2019s the one that brought it to my attention that the queue followers are obsessed with number 17. As you will hear on this clip from Greg Carr worlds, higher side chat, his 2020 show here with crystals.\n\nthe thing that I sort of got on the whole 17th thing is, you know, I was looking at one of the things that always struck me about St. Patrick\u2019s Day and I did a big post on this is the St. Patrick\u2019s Day just really seems to be like just the back and Alia, the ancient Balkan Alia, from Rome. I mean, it\u2019s literally the same thing. I mean, not even remotely different. It\u2019s astonishing. And of course, St. Patrick\u2019s Day was not a creation of Irish Catholics. It was a creation of Irish Protestant Freemasons. That\u2019s another thing that people seem to forget. But anyhow, you know, the whole thing with the Bacchanalia is that, you know, you get together and have these parades and you get drunk and you eat beef and cabbage. It\u2019s just astonishingly, the same thing. It\u2019s just ridiculous. But this all stems back to Osiris, because back is Stein ISIS, you know, as a lot of people understand is, is a incarnation of Osiris is a version of Cyrus peazy that directly dropped him Osiris, so they have the same fantasy Share it into scene, but Osiris and this ties back to the genuflecting because hieroglyph, as a number of scholars have pointed out is clearly Osiris. Right? So 317 is the date of Osiris, his death at the hands of the jackal headed demon Gods set. And that the 17th thing, the importance of the death of the 17th I\u2019m sort of like became like, really 13 emerged from the suppression and the execution of the Knights Templar, right, and the whole thing with Friday 13th being unlucky springs from the the arrest of the de molay, and all those people in Paris at the hands of King Philip, right. So why is Friday the 13th? I\u2019m lucky, you know, how did this emerge in the culture and it all ties back to the Knights Templar. And similarly, this whole thing with 17 ties back to a Cyrus and that 17 became some sort of code using the Roman numerals was 17. In ancient Rome, it\u2019s like, this will be the day I die or something. I\u2019m some sort of code that had to deal with death, and misfortune and so on. But, for instance, the Freemasons, the Grand Lodge of England was officially established on St. John\u2019s day 1717. So you just see 17 emerge over and over again, you know what I mean, during the inauguration celebration concerts in 2017, after Jon Voight said, quote, we have been witness to a barrage of propaganda that left us all breathless with anticipation not knowing if God could reverse all the negative lines against Mr. Trump, whose only desire was to make America great again. And there\u2019s lots of these weird things that support this stuff. And like the inauguration happened in 2017, of course, you know, 17. There it is, again. And there\u2019s lots of these ideas that are floating that, that Donnie T is a God. He\u2019s a deity walking amongst mortal men. That inauguration parade from the Capitol building to the White House, and one that goes past that Washington novelist, course had Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, her name is Karen, real life, Karen. But it also had Mike Pence, his high school band there. What\u2019s the name of his high school you ask? Well, he\u2019s from a town called Columbus, Indiana. And he went to the Columbus North High school band. So I\u2019m curious, all these elements lined up in 2017. They do the raising of Osiris and the Columbus high school band is there, the goddess evoked? And people wondered why Trump chose pens, if you recall, he was a relatively unknown guy. Well, I mean, maybe right, maybe they\u2019re lining up some ritualistic elements there. He is from Columbus, Indiana. And then after the parade, the first the very first act, Donald Trump made as president was in the Oval Office, signing an order to dissolve the Affordable Care Act. access to health insurance. That\u2019s the real evil, he says. But the point here is that as Steve Bannon orchestrated campaign in 2016 told you he was the cast candidate here to burn it all down. But the real question is, what do they want to build from the ashes? That\u2019s what I wonder. The second act of the inauguration was the next day and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary said it was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration. And they started this is when they started talking about the mainstream media being fake news. Because the fake news mainstream media said that the crowd was actually a third of Obama\u2019s. And they\u2019ve got records from all over the place supporting this idea. They\u2019ve got photos, you can look at them with your own eyes. And this was the first time they started this divide of questioning reality, trusting in the mainstream media, the official words. Fact Trump directed his people to get photos of the crowd. With it, it didn\u2019t even that didn\u2019t even support the claim either. Some FOIA Doc\u2019s from September 2018, showed that Donald Trump directed the National Park Service to crop the photos to make the crowd look larger. Because even when he got the photos, he said, Oh, shoot, well. Maybe it wasn\u2019t that big of a crowd. So he wanted to crop the photo. That\u2019s, that\u2019s what I\u2019m reading here on the The Guardian COMM The link in the show notes. Now his speech, which he insisted he wrote New York Times, I believe, said that they think Steve Bannon wrote it, because again, Steve Bannon is the orchestrator of a lot of this stuff going on. As we\u2019ll get into in part two. The speech was one of the shortest and most ominous in US history. George W. Bush referred to his speech as quote, some weird shit. It\u2019s pretty bad. When old GW is saying some weird shit. I\u2019m gonna redo the I\u2019m gonna redo some of the speech quote. But for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factory scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation, and education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge, and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives, and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American Carnage stops right here and stops right now. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. Now, I\u2019m not going to get political because again, I\u2019m not telling you to vote for I don\u2019t care. I like none of these creeps. But, you know, I\u2019m in the middle class, and I looked at my 2019 tax return and it sure didn\u2019t look any given them my 2018 tax return. So that tax cut, like they told you went to the wealthiest of Americans. Because, you know, that\u2019s where their allegiances lie. That\u2019s a fact it\u2019s undisputable fact. Because they bind to this whole trickle down economics bullshit based on this. This, uh, this fantasy and this ever widening gap between the upper and lower class somehow close when you give more money to the top to the upper class. You played yourself? If you say wisely if that\u2019s true, but all those other principles I stand for that the lib tardes don\u2019t that\u2019s why I voted this way. And I respect that. Yeah, I got it. I\u2019m with you on that. I don\u2019t I don\u2019t like the liberals. They become the party banning free speech. Like Donnie T, he\u2019s got some good merits. They\u2019re not all bad. In fact, I believe one of his first acts was to try to rein in Big Pharma. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s all that bad. I\u2019m saying his chest for these folks. They know how to dangle certain carrots. It\u2019s just which carrot Do you want to jump for a while they proceed with their agenda, because that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Then finally, he says, quote, We stand this is at the speech, the strange shit speech. As Bush said, We stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies industries and technologies of tomorrow, a new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. Is that a veiled truth about Project Blue Beam, he did start the US space force which has the motto always above. I would add so below after that, maybe, as you\u2019ll read about in my book, aliens, you have chosen a call on Amazon, hopefully by now audible. But nothing else. Besides those statements, support the idea that that Trump thinks he\u2019s the Osiris. But it doesn\u2019t matter. He thinks they do the ritual for every president. He may not even know about it. He may have no idea. So that laid up the foundation for our part two, which I beg you to join me on. We\u2019re gonna get real interesting, real weird. We\u2019re gonna talk about Steve Bannon, the chaos candidate, we\u2019re going to do a recap on Pepe the Frog sigil magic, order out of chaos. Oh, boy, is it gonna get real weird psyops? And, you know, we got all kinds of stuff on here. I got I\u2019m looking through my notes. So it\u2019s a lot. So, we\u2019re gonna get into that we\u2019re gonna talk about that feels good, man, Doc. So you can check that out maybe before the next show, if you want, you know, if not, I\u2019ll fill you in the gaps. And we\u2019re gonna talk about what\u2019s happening here. We\u2019re going to expose the Q truth to QA non truth. So until next time, my friends. Oh, by the way, hey, before I let you go, don\u2019t forget I\u2019m gonna pull some images on the Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt like it subscribe. If you haven\u2019t already. I know most of us have.
