Many students refused to comply with the mandate, including six who are now suing the school over their right to be educated. (Related: California school board votes not to support, enforce or comply with pending COVID-19 vaccine mandate.)\n\nThe six female students who are part of the lawsuit showed up for school despite being unvaccinated. They believed they would be able to go to class regardless. However, as soon as they arrived school officials denied them entry. They shot videos of the incident on their smartphones while they waited outside the school.\n\nThe video the students took was then shared by the pro-vaccine-choice organization Let Them Breathe. It showed the unvaccinated students being cordoned off behind roped barriers while school officials refused to let them enter their classrooms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being threatened to be suspended because we don\u2019t have the COVID-19 vaccine and we\u2019re being refused of the right to attend school,\u201d said one of the students in the video.\n\nSince the video\u2019s release, the unvaccinated students featured in it say they have received even more harassment. One of the students said she has received a constant barrage of messages asking her why she isn\u2019t vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThey literally come to message me to fight me about it,\u201d she said. \u201cOne, why is it their business? And two, I don\u2019t know why they should care and it\u2019s my personal information.\u201d\n\nAccording to New West, it informed students and parents of the COVID-19 vaccine in Oct. 2021, telling them students would need to provide proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 PCR test to be allowed on campus \u201cjust like every indoor establishment in Los Angeles is doing.\u201d\n\nOfficials stated students who chose to remain unvaccinated would be provided with \u201cindependent study options,\u201d and that their parents were well informed of these options.\n\nThe school bragged about achieving a compliance rate of 96 percent, but \u201csix students who did not follow the new policy still attempted to participate in classes.\n\nSchool officials asked the students to leave, but they refused and insisted on going to class.\n\n\u201cThe students proceeded to stage a sit-in directly behind designated areas for student PCR screenings on campus, which was cordoned off with tape,\u201d said the school in its statement. \u201cNew West Charter School administration notified local authorities who came to campus and helped alleviate the disruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cFemale students were segregated, harassed and threatened with suspension just for trying to participate in their classes, and we will prove in court that this is unjust and unlawful,\u201d said Sharon McKeeman, founder of Let Them Breathe, which is representing the students and their parents in the lawsuit against New West.\n\nLet Them Breathe previously won a lawsuit against San Diego Unified School District\u2019s vaccine mandate late last year. McKeeman said her organization\u2019s lawsuit against New West is very similar and very likely to be successful.\n\n\u201cNew West Charter School\u2019s student vaccine mandate is even more egregious than San Diego Unified\u2019s,\u201d said McKeeman.\n\n\u201cWe have filed a lawsuit against New West arguing that they are violating state law by mandating this new vaccine, not allowing personal belief exemptions and segregating and denying unvaccinated students their education,\u201d she added.\n\nLet Them Breathe\u2019s lawsuit claims New West\u2019s vaccine mandate violates the Equal Protection Clause in California\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe charter school\u2019s mandate grants \u201cconditional admission\u201d without vaccination for students who are foster youth, homeless, migrants, in a military family or who are participating in an individualized education program.\n\nThe lawsuit says treating these unvaccinated children \u201cmore favorably than other unvaccinated children\u201d amounts to discrimination.\n\nAdditionally, the lawsuit claims New West broke California law by not providing a personal beliefs exemption in its vaccine mandate, by violating the students\u2019 right to privacy and by denying California children their \u201cfundamental right to a free public education.\u201d\n\nEditorial: UChicago must end its booster mandate \u2026 we are not lab rats.\n\nCovid fascism: Yale threatens students, says they can\u2019t eat at off-campus restaurants.\n\nCanadian university forcing online students to report their vaccination status or be PUNISHED.\n\nWatch this video of one of the New West Charter School students being effectively segregated from the rest of the school due to their vaccination status.\n\nThis video can be found on the channel ZGoldenReport on Brighteon.com.\n\nRead more stories about schools forcing students to get vaccinated at EducationSystem.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Los Angeles charter school being sued for SEGREGATING and DISCRIMINATING against unvaccinated students", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-01-27-los-angeles-charter-school-segregating-discriminating-unvaccinated.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "A group of students and their parents in Los Angeles are suing a charter school for its discriminatory policies towards students who are not vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).
