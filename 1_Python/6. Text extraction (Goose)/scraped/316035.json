If you want your child to be vaccinated, you can get them vaccinated.

Unlikely allies are finding each other on the path to getting informed and claiming their rights. This is a global issue that reaches far beyond California and we believe that this is one of the biggest and most pressing issues of our times.\n\nNo documentary has ever demonstrated what is at stake, or what we can do, like VAXXED. The movie is currently available in theatres. You can check out their schedule, host a screening or sign up to stay informed at the link below.\n\nJoin us for this compelling conversation with Foster, Kimberly and the filmmakers of VAXXED, Andrew Wakefield and Del Bigtree.\n\nRead a transcript of the audio (to translate the transcript, choose your language at the top of this page)\n\nFoster Gamble: Okay, well, welcome everyone. Kimberly and I have been very excited about this conversation. As you know, we\u2019ve been not doing public broadcast for a period of time now where we\u2019ve been dedicated to other projects in that the Liberty area and in working with our ThriveConnect inventors, but when we saw of the movie \u201cVaxxed\u201d a couple of weeks ago for the first time, we were so profoundly impacted that we talked it over afterwards and decided we wanted to offer anything that we could from ourselves and from our global network to help get this message out to the world as quickly and as effectively as possible.\n\nSo, we have Dr. Andrew Wakefield with us today and his partner in making the film \u201cVaxxed\u201d, Del Bigtree. Let me give you a brief introduction of them as a welcome on board here and to let you know who they are if you\u2019re not already familiar with it. Dr. Andrew Wakefield it is a British gastroenterologist and medical researcher who had been doing very diligent, highly respected work and then, in 1998, he had the courage and the data to suggest a link between the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine when delivered altogether and in heavy and early doses and the connection of all of that to autism. So, he publish a paper because he thought it was really important to do and his recommendation was simply that more work needed to be done to be certain of the safety of these vaccines and the schedules by which they were delivered. Well, all hell broke loose and the full fury of the what some might call the medical mafia was unleashed on him, slandering him in the media and taking away his license to practice and, perhaps even more importantly, more recently, he\u2019s the co-writer and director of the new movie, \u201cVaxxed\u201d. So, welcome Andy.\n\nAndrew Wakefield: Great to be here.\n\nFoster: And then, Del is a highly respected medical reporter and a producer for many years on the renowned daytime medical talk show, \u201cThe Doctors\u201d Now, he\u2019s been the producer of \u201cVaxxed\u201d and Del has had the courage to recognize a huge threat to people\u2019s health in getting to know Andy and his work, especially the health of young children, and then has being willing to risk his career and his reputation to take a stand for the truth of what he discovered. So, Del, congratulations and welcome.\n\nDel Bigtree: Thank you very much for having me. It\u2019s an honor to be talking to you.\n\nFoster: Well, it great to be with you and we\u2019re looking forward to be sharing this with our network and beyond. I wrote a blog a few months ago, collating 10 years of my research into this really critical topic and one of the quotes that I use was from Dr. Suzanne Humphries, who iss the author of \u201cDissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History\u201d. And she says in there just quite simply and directly, she says, \u201cyou cannot dabble in the topic of vaccination\u201d and that really struck me. Kimberly and I have children and grandchildren, most of whom are in California where now these vaccines are being mandated and the heavy duty schedule and actually, Kimberly is the person that I know, personally, who was onto this earlier than anyone else in my life, fortunately, for her kids. Kimberly, I want to welcome you in and hear a little bit from you about your perspective on this and how you got onto it so early.\n\nKimberly: Well, thank you. I am so honored and I\u2019m so grateful for the work that you\u2019re doing. I feel like the movie \u201cVaxxed\u201d brings the conversation up that I have been waiting for since the 1970s.\n\nI had my first child in 1978 and I remember I looked at his perfect little healthy body and when I went to take him into the pediatrician who suggested that he get the MMR I just said, \u201cGosh, he just seems so perfect right now. Could I just see how you decided on combining MMR and are those deadly? And what if I waited?\u201d I just wanted to see some data on why? And how come now? And how come combined? And I was met with this totally shaming response just for asking the question. It was \u201cYou don\u2019t want your baby to die do you? And not only that, it\u2019s irresponsible. If you don\u2019t do it, then you put in jeopardy all the other kids.\u201d I said, \u201cWait a minute\u2026if they\u2019re vaccinated, why would my not being vaccinated put them at risk? I\u2019m not I\u2019m not getting this.\u201d So I said, \u201cI\u2019m just not comfortable with this. I want to see something.\u201d\n\nSo, I just started doing a little bit of research and I came upon a book from 1957 called \u201cThe Poison Needle\u201d and it was like whoa!, that one had some far out stuff, but it at least confirmed that there was more to it than just this-is-absolute-strong-science-so-go-for-it. I found this doctor who was willing to separate them.\n\nI like the idea. Vaccines make sense to me. As an overall concept in health, it makes sense to me. It was just the timing, and the dose, and the contents and the lack of informed consent. I felt like every parent on the planet cares. That\u2019s one of the biggest decisions you can ever make for your children, what they\u2019re going to put in their bodies, so I knew I wasn\u2019t different from other parents in caring.\n\nSo, I was able to track down this doctor who is willing to order them separately for me. I think we had to order them from Europe. I don\u2019t even remember the details. I only remember thinking that if it didn\u2019t work at least it wouldn\u2019t work in a smaller dose and would be recoverable.\n\nAnyway, it turned into the pro and anti vaccine conversation that I felt missed the point. That was such an oversimplification. It wasn\u2019t pro or against. It was content, schedule, interaction, and whether or not it was voluntary, and whether or not it could be informed consent and I feel like your work and this movie brings that level of thoughtfulness to the conversation and allows parents to be more informed, which is what it\u2019s all about. Make your own decisions, but make it with the information.\n\nI was so energized after seeing the movie I just felt like thank you, thank you, thank you. This is exactly what\u2019s been missing and I am profoundly grateful for my grandchildren and all the children on the planet and, honestly, for the human species, which I think is at stake if we handover our right to control what goes into our bodies. So, welcome and thank you.\n\nFoster: So for the folks that are watching this, this is what we hope to cover today and any surprises that come up are great. We\u2019re going to ask these two about the background story of this and especially the science involved because film has nailed the scientific data and the personal stories like nothing that we\u2019ve seen and then we want to hear from you about the personal, human side of what this has been like for you discovering this information, right in the thick of the process, and getting it out there. And then we want to talk especially about what can we do strategically and tactically? What can individuals and groups and networks do to assist you and others in turning this around?\n\nBut I want to turn it over you now and we\u2019d like you to start, Andy, if you would beginning with what was the main turning point for you? If you think back to one point\u2026your career is going along great and you\u2019re doing all these wonderful things and something occurs that shifts your awareness and and then this adventure begins. If you would, please recount that for us and then tell us little bit about the key scientific points that you discovered and that you\u2019re in the process of getting out in this film. Then we\u2019ll ask Del to do the same thing.\n\nAndrew: I started out as a gastroenterologist and I trained as a surgeon for many years and then I got involved in research for a period in Canada, where I was working on small intestinal transplantation. That was a complete waste of time in many ways. Surgeons like to join things together and cut bits out, but my interests were Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis - inflammatory bowel diseases that are now epidemic and have appeared in children. That must be an environmental factor. We made some discoveries during my time in Toronto General Hospital that made me shift more towards the research arena, so I came back to England. I got involved in setting up a research team, ultimately, with about 19 people, producing some very interesting insights into inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nWe asked the question, \u201cWas there some link between measles virus and inflammatory bowel disease?\u201d because we\u2019d observed with some colleagues in Sweden that mothers who suffered with measles during pregnancy, which is very rare because most mothers have been infected as children. They gave birth to children who went on to develop severe Crohn\u2019s disease. It was extraordinary - one in six million chance. I then wrote to the Department of Health and this was a turning point, one getting to your first question. I wrote to the Department of Health and said \u201cCrohns disease has appeared in children only since the single vaccine has become available. We don\u2019t know what this means, but we have found this link with measles virus. \u201c We published three or four papers on it.\n\nThe response I got was very telling. They were not interested in the safety aspects. It was an irritation to them. The Department of Health could not have been more unhelpful and more obstructive. We were rather like Boy Scouts writing this, \u201cLook, we thought you\u2019d be interested. Here\u2019s more information\u201d, and it just got trashed. We were discarded. They didn\u2019t want to know. It took two years to set up a meeting that I\u2019d requested. That was the first point was the indifference of the regulators to the issue of safety.\n\nThe second came when, in 1995, parents started calling me and saying my child was perfectly normal. They were developing normally. They had all their milestones met and then they had an MMR vaccine and they disappeared. They had a seizure. They had a fever. They slept for days on end and when they woke up, they were never the same again.\n\nIt was a compelling story, but I knew nothing about autism, which was their eventual diagnosis, but these children had suffered severe gastrointestinal problems, which was highly relevant to my discipline so I heard the story a sufficient number of times that a pattern emerged. Something was going on. And the parents would say these things started at the same time, the deterioration in mental function and the gastrointestinal features. And when the bowel system\u2019s are better, then the behavior is better. There\u2019s a parallel between these. We think what is going on in the intestine is affecting the brain.\n\nDoctors that they\u2019d been to see would say, \u201cNo, this is simply autism. Get over it. Put your child in a home. Get on with your life.\u201d That was tragic because one of the fundamental rules of clinical medicine is that symptoms in patients have an organic origin until proven otherwise. In other words, there is an underlying disease until you have ruled that out. That is your duty. So, we investigated these children. I did so with a team, including Professor John Walker Smith and his colleagues, and John, at that time, was the world\u2019s leading pediatric gastroenterologist, one of the founding fathers of the discipline, and he and his team investigated these children and, lo and behold, the parents were right. The children had an inflammatory bowel disease that, when treated, led not only to improvement in the intestinal symptoms, but also the behavior. That was fascinating. So, there they were. They were right about the bowel symptoms and the inflammatory bowel disease. The medical professions was almost, to a man and a woman, completely wrong. They had been, in many cases, negligent of these children who had been suffering for many years.\n\nSo, the next question, \u201cIs this linked to the vaccine?\u201d had to be taken extremely seriously. Well, we did that. Or, at least, I did that and that was the beginning of the end of my career. There were two things there in the terms of the turning point. One of them is my colleagues in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology said to me, \u201cAndy, as pediatricians, we cannot be seen to question the safety of MMR.\u201d That made absolutely no sense to me either as a physician or a scientist or indeed a humanitarian. If we had said, \u201cWe cannot be seen to question the safety of Vioxx or thalidomide or cyanide.\u201d It made no sense just because it was a vaccine and therefore, part of this religion that I came to discover.\n\nThe second was that the dean of the medical school said to me, \u201cIf you pursue this work, it will not be good for your career.\u201d He was correct. He was absolutely correct. It may be just my difficult personality, but I decided to work twice as hard on it because this was not in the interest of patients. All of these decisions were political decisions, decisions about personal status, perception, how your colleagues might think about you. It had nothing to do with the primary objective of medicine, which is to put the patient first and foremost. There is no ambiguity whatsoever about who your responsibility is to. So, that\u2019s what I did.\n\nWe pursued this when I left the Royal Free (Hospital), which is rarely mentioned. We published about 15 papers, dissecting out the minutiae of the bowel disease, separating it from Crohn\u2019s, separating it from food allergies, showing it had unique patterns and signatures, and I eventually was forced out of my medical school. I was forced out of my profession. They couldn\u2019t stop the work so they set News International\u2019s Brian Deer, the journalist, on me and the rest kind of then just spiraled out of control and I left for America to continue the work. That was followed by allegations of fraud in order to ultimately destroy my opportunity to do any work because once you label a scientist a fraud, it takes five minutes to do that and a lifetime or more, if ever, to restore that. Scientists are extremely vulnerable in that respect. All of that, then fast forward 20 years from the original parent story, now we have the CDC whistleblower coming forward and saying, \u201cActually, the parents were right all along and we\u2019ve known it for 14 years and we\u2019ve hidden it.\u201d What a tragedy that all that waste of time, all those wasted children, and all that pain and suffering that could have been mitigated all because of a lie - a terrible, terrible lie. That\u2019s really, in a nutshell, my story.\n\nFoster: Wow. Thank you for that. The phrase comes to mind from philosophy that the core allegiance is the fidelity to truth and I know that that can be really risky as George Orwell says that telling the truth in an age of deception is a revolutionary act. I really appreciate what you\u2019ve done and what you\u2019re going through.\n\nSo Del, what was the turning point for you?\n\nDel: Well, there\u2019s a lot in my life, I think, that led me to this moment, this time, and this film, but specifically to how I got involved with the film, I had been a producer, as you said, on \u201cThe Doctors\u201d for six years. I was sort of known as being the producer, there\u2019s seven teams on the show, so I did a lot of more controversial stories like when it was ruled that Monsanto\u2019s product, glyphosate, which is the herbicide sprayed on 80 to 90% of our crop,s now and the WHO said that that was probably carcinogenic to humans, I did that story on the show, but I didn\u2019t just talk about it. I managed to get a debate between the toxicologist, Donna Farmer, from Monsanto to debate Jeffrey Smith on television. I was really happy I was able pull that off, but those were the types of things I did and, luckily, the show allowed me to do those stories.\n\nI\u2019ve always celebrated the best that medicine has to offer: the great doctors, the great scientists, new technologies, and even new medicines. It was a great opportunity, but I did always questions this corporate power involved and when corporations, in the world we live in today, you watch more and more control of the government and really wonder are things being done for our best interests, so those stories always intrigued me. Because I\u2019d done so many stories like that, I had some real insiders in medicine and things who would feed me new stories or new ideas and I got a call from one of the doctors I\u2019d worked with who said, \u201cDel, there\u2019s going to be a whistleblower from the Centers for Disease Control. He\u2019s going to come forward and say that they have committed fraud on some of the vaccine studies and they know that vaccines are causing autism.\u201d\n\nIn that moment, I thought if that really happens, if that\u2019s true, that\u2019s going to be the biggest medical story of my lifetime. I wasn\u2019t able to do that on \u201cThe Doctors\u201d television show because we had direct pharmaceutical sponsors. We were doing interstitials with pharmaceutical sponsors. The CDC was a very good friend of the show. We had them on show all the time. They gave us access inside the CDC. So the show had no desire to go near this topic, which I sort of expected. But I said to them, as a producer pitching to the executives, \u201cLook, I just want you to know you heard it first from me\u201d because it was two weeks before it was even announced and then, of course, Andy Wakefield and Brian Hooker put forward the information and we heard the words of Dr. William Thompson two weeks later.\n\nI had assumed CNN, MSN, NBC, Fox, all these news stations would pick it up and then, maybe, when it blew up to the big story that I knew it would be, I would get an opportunity to take a doctor\u2019s perspective on it. When the news came out and nobody, not a single mainstream newspaper, not a single news agency touched the story. You got to think about when you\u2019re in media, we\u2019ve come to a place where we call it infotainment now. It sort of has to grab viewers and we know that it\u2019s sensational and I think we\u2019re all aware of that. So, when you think of a story where you have a top government scientists coming forward from the most important health agency in the world saying, \u201cVaccines may be causing autism\u201d or \u201cWe doctored a study that saw a direct link between vaccines and autism\u201d, you had to know that was going to sell newspapers. That would be the biggest story. People would be glued to their TVs no matter how you told that story - whether you said the guy is crazy, we got into it and went and investigated it and this lunatic is saying something crazy or we looked into the science and this is really terrifying - either way, there should have been a story and when there was no story at all, a complete media blackout, I listen to Andy\u2019s story, and your told you cannot talk about something, especially as a journalist, that just lit the fire in me.\n\nI said there is something really big here. This is even bigger than a scientist coming forward and saying ,\u201cVaccines may cause autism\u201d. None of the media\u2019s allowed to talk about it. Who\u2019s controlling the media? What is going on? That was when I knew I had to get to the bottom of the story and then, of course, I researched and through some amazing contacts and fairly serendipitous events, I met Andy Wakefield and the rest is history. I think Andy saw in me, I think, the passion that I had and wanted to know about the subject and then it was just an amazing year working with Andy, who I think is one of the great scientific minds of our time. We, together, made a documentary that even transcends any of our abilities. It\u2019s a very powerful piece and I\u2019m very proud of it.\n\nFoster: One of the most profound pieces of information for me in your film was when Stephanie Seneff, from MIT, says that if the emergence of autism continues to grow just the way it is now, much less faster, that by 2032 (and that\u2019s only16 years from now), 50% of children and 80% of the boys will be on the autism spectrum. And then she goes on, you all do, to make the case very clearly, that over and beyond just the sheer human suffering of all that, to imagine the time and the money cost to the human species. So, could you talk a little bit more about some of the key pieces of data that you\u2019re revealing in this film that most people simply aren\u2019t familiar with?\n\nAndrew: Certainly. Firstly, the data on the rising numbers of cases comes from the CDC itself. That\u2019s to the extent that you can trust the CDC\u2019s data and I\u2019ll mention that. This is no doubt mirrored in the experience statewide. You can look at individual states like Utah or New Jersey, then the rate of autism is absolutely huge and the risk for a child born today - because one has to remember that those data are based upon 8 year-olds 8 years ago - so the risk for a child born today is 1 in 25. When I was in medical school, we weren\u2019t even taught about it, it was so rare. If it does continue in the way it is, then that prediction will come to pass. People say, that if only a certain number of people are susceptible, then surely it will plateau out at some stage, but it\u2019s showing no signs of doing that.\n\nBut, moreover, they are accelerating the program, increasing the number of vaccines, increasing the toxicity, that children are suffering all the time to the extent now mother\u2019s are being given three doses of thimerosal containing flu vaccines while pregnant. Thompson himself, the whistleblower, says this is the last group of people you would ever want to inject with mercury. It is not that the toxic load has stabilized. It continues to increase and it impacts children, infants and the fetus, at increasingly sensitive times.\n\nThe problem perhaps isn\u2019t underestimating. The numbers aren\u2019t underestimated and the reason I say that is the same guilty parties, the same people who took part in the fraud that we documented in our documentary who have now been indicted in another fraud in Utah, which is one of the centers where the CDC collect their autism data, for miscounting the autism numbers, another whistleblower case against the same fraudsters who took part in this study. We really are in a mire of ignorance, but what is absolutely clear at this street level is that this disorder is everywhere and lesser degrees of this disorder are even more pervasive. This is not just autism. It\u2019s something far, far more sinister and far wider.\n\nDel: I can say as a journalist in investigating this and working with Andy, living with Polly Tommey (one of the mothers that has a vaccine-injured child that appears in our film), I knew this was an issue and we hear the numbers. We hear the 1 in 68, 1 in 45, 1 in 25, but it\u2019s really hard to put perspective on that and nothing prepared me for this tour we\u2019ve been on in a different city almost every night representing the film. Hundreds and hundreds of parents every night standing up in the audience and then coming forward afterwards and sharing their version of this same story, this vaccine injury, the loss of their child, and many of them deaths. Many deaths that don\u2019t even relate to autism. Or paralysis. Or just issues that aren\u2019t even in this autism issue.\n\nYou start thinking, jeez, if we\u2019re at 1 in 25 children with autism, but there\u2019s all of these other ailments that are possibly coming from vaccines that these parents are reporting to, what is the statistic of vaccine injury itself? If you think about it now, we\u2019re at a place in America where 50% of all children in classrooms have a chronic issue, have a chronic disease of one sort or another. We are accepting a new level of health that we should not be. This is the new normal to have. I remember asthma. There was one kid in my school that had the little inhaler. Now, there\u2019s 10 or 20 in a classroom that have inhalers. Deadly peanut allergies where no one can bring peanut butter to school. Eczema is just running rampant. Children with skin diseases, autoimmune diseases, childhood leukemia (and very specific types) everywhere. It goes on and on and on \u201cThe Doctors\u201d television show we would even say this, that the medical perspective is that this is going to be the first generation of children that do not live to be as old as their parents.\n\nThen you ask yourself, with the great hospital system we have and all of these great vaccines, if they work, why would that be the case? Why are we so unhealthy? Why are our children so unhealthy? Just about 10 days ago, CBS reported we have more infants die on the first day of life in the United States of America than every other industrialized nation combined. You have to ask yourself, why would that be? We have the best doctors. We have the best pediatricians., hospital care, incubators, you name it. How can you explain that? Then you look at the fact that we\u2019re one of the only nations that will inject a vaccine into a baby on day one. We are mandated a HEP-B vaccine, a sexually-transmitted disease the child will never come in contact with until they\u2019re either sexually active or sharing needles, unfortunately. So then you think it\u2019s filled with aluminum, neurotoxins and things like that into a baby. The insanity of that. \u201cHello. Welcome to the world. You\u2019re gasping for your first breath and while you\u2019re at it, we\u2019re going to inject you with your first sexually-transmitted disease. Welcome to the United States of America.\u201d From that space right there, I question the intelligence of every pediatrician doing it and every doctor. It makes absolutely no sense.\n\nFoster: One of the things you guys have done so well in the film is you not only laid out the data very solidly and scientifically, but you tell the human story. Kimberly and I are deeply familiar with this story, but I was just moved to tears repeatedly during the film hearing that, first of all, just the stories from the parents, what they went through. And then, secondly, seeing some actual video of these kids going through these seizures and so forth and I\u2019ll never forget when it\u2019s like this case and this case, and then you pan back to an entire screen full of these images and it hits me, oh my god, this is a fraction of the millions of families that this is affecting, so I appreciate your courage to go ahead and lay it out that powerfully.\n\nDel, I wanted to ask you to talk a little bit about the William Thompson story because this took it to a whole new level and I know that one of the quotes from him, one of the things he\u2019s recorded in saying, is \u201cwe did unethical vile things\u201d. Could you talk a little bit about what those things were and how it came out?\n\nDel: The truth is that Andy was directly involved with this story from the beginning. Brian Hooker contacted him right away when Dr. William Thompson had reached out to Brian Hooker, but I\u2019ll touch on the parts that I can because as a medical journalist, the things that really grabbed me and I want people to know is what we hear a lot is this whistleblower\u2019s come forward and a lot of people try and say he\u2019s a liar. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d do that until you\u2019ve had him in a court of law, which in this case is the Congress of the United States. We\u2019re still trying to get this man subpoenaed. He\u2019s been waiting for two years. The statements he\u2019s made are absolutely incredible. He\u2019s provided 10,000 documents to back these statements up, including internal emails. You will see in our film interactions between he and the other scientists he\u2019s complaining to: \u201cWe cannot do this. We\u2019ve got to tell the truth.\u201d It\u2019s an amazing amount of testimony and fact-based data that you will find in our film.\n\nBut for me, what you really have to think about is people say, \u201cwell, what about all the other studies done?\u201d I hear that a lot. But there\u2019s something about this study that\u2019s extremely important. In fact, I was just two days ago in Jason Chaffetz\u2019s office. We had an incredible meeting with the head of the committee that has to call Dr. William Thompson and subpoena him and I said, \u201cLook, if this had been one of many studies, thousands of studies, and somewhere in the middle, there was some manipulation of data and things were thrown out when the study was done, well we would just throw that study out. Maybe you\u2019d certainly try and get rid of those scientists that are doing it. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal. I don\u2019t know. But this isn\u2019t just any study. This is the study that was used to stop all investigations of the connection between vaccines and autism. This study, which we now know is a fraud, based on what William Thompson has not only said, but the data he\u2019s provided \u2013 he shows us the data, shows us how it was thrown away, shows us a larger group of 3,000 kids that was supposed to be the heart of the study and how they threw out half of those kids to change the numbers.\n\nThis is all scientific fraud at the most egregious level, but the point being that when I worked on \u201cThe Doctors\u201d television show, this is the study we pointed to when we said, \u201cVaccines are safe and effective. It\u2019s been proven.\u201d This study. Not all the other ones. This specific study because 10 years ago in 2004, when this study came out, the United States government said, that\u2019s it. Because of this study, we are not going to fund any more research on the connection between vaccines and autism and that has left us now 12 years behind the curve in doing the studies that, now when you hear what William Thompson is saying, that they knew there was a connection, we are 12 years behind on important research. Millions of children are being put in harms way and that it\u2019s a government agency that\u2019s done it is the greatest scientific fraud of our lifetime. I\u2019ll have Andy speak a little bit more about directly working with Thompson because he knew what was happening while it was happening.\n\nAndrew: Yes. Interacting with William Thompson, beginning with a number of whistleblowers over the years, they come forward for a variety of reasons. Thompson, his conscience had troubled him from the very beginning. As Del said, he had been fundamental to the design of the study, to the conduct of the study, and to the analysis of the information so, had this been a money-laundering ring, he would have been the accountant, the last person you would want plea bargaining with the Feds. This was William Thompson.\n\nFrom the outset, he said, \u201cwe have got a problem\u201d and he said it initially to his colleagues who were co-authors of the paper. He then, when he didn\u2019t get satisfaction at that point, he took it to his immediate manager and then took it to the head of the National Immunization Program, Walter Orenstein, and he took it to the director of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding, all of whom seemed to have dismissed him out-of-hand. In other words, they were aware of the fraud, they were aware of the data linking MMR to autism and they chose to bury it, to ignore it.\n\nThe authors then went about actually destroying the documents that they felt incriminated the MMR and, by extension, themselves. They selected those documents out and then in late 2002, they destroyed those documents. William Thompson, realizing that this was a felony, they were now setting about destroying material evidence that was government property, that this was, in fact, a felony. These documents were under FOIA requests. They were being requested by the Department of Justice and they should have been preserved for all time. Thompson, realizing that, kept the documents. This was a crucial thing because without those documents, without him being able to provide those to us, then it would have been a case of incompetence rather than fraud. We could never have proven the fraud.\n\nBut with those documents in hand, we were absolutely confident with the interviews with Thompson, with the recorded phone calls, with all of those documents, we came forward and said this is fraud. The documentary states that quite clearly with the proviso that, of course, if it\u2019s not, then they can sue us. Well, that\u2019s not going to happen. They know that what we have here is true. So, we were completely confident in going forward that what we had here was the truth and for the first time ever in the history of the world an insider coming forward and saying this, and, of course, what we realized was that so many of these other studies that they\u2019ve done exonerating the vaccines, which the vast majority have been under the control of the CDC, the ones to which Del refers, studies with thousands of children, that we have to treat those studies with a great deal of skepticism now. They\u2019re fraud until proven otherwise. The difference about those studies, of course, is that we did not have a whistleblower on those. For this one, we do and we hope that now exposing this and getting safety research a chance outside the CDC will give access to all of those studies so that people can scrutinize the data and come to the correct conclusion.\n\nFoster: Last I heard, this whistleblower, William Thompson, was still working at the CDC. Is that correct? I wonder how things are on a daily basis for him.\n\nDel: He\u2019s still is it employed by the CDC. He\u2019s protected by whistleblower status so that they can\u2019t fire him. We have left him there for too long. There\u2019s concern that for two years now, he\u2019s been sitting amongst the people he\u2019s accused - and with himself. He said, \u201dWe all were a part of it\u201d. He doesn\u2019t exonerate himself - of this great scientific fraud. That\u2019s what\u2019s so alarming. That\u2019s why we worked so hard to get this film out as fast as we could. This is a film we could have spent two or three more years on it. Luckily, it has the quality it does due to some real help from some great Hollywood people that were involved, too. But, we were in a rush. We\u2019ve got to get Dr. William Thompson subpoenaed before the Congress before somehow there\u2019s too much pressure put on him for his health declines. There are so many issues. This is a guy that\u2019s won awards almost every year in his career. No one\u2019s saying that he\u2019s incapable. No one\u2019s saying he has an ax to grind. So why aren\u2019t we hearing this before the Congress?\n\nFoster: We\u2019ve been following and sharing with our network the story of over 30, now I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s over 40, suspicious death amongst holistic doctors, particularly doctors who either have alternative treatments for cancer or, in the case of Jeff Bradstreet, are working on solid data on the autism/vaccine connection. I hope that he\u2019s getting the security that he needs and I really am so grateful to him for having brought this much information out. I think it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s kept him alive; it\u2019s because the information is already out.\n\nAndrew: I would say that one of the reasons, which we state in the film is why we outed him, is that very reason. When you watch \u201cThe Insider\u201d, the movie, the tobacco expos\u00e9, then you realize if you\u2019re a whistleblower, then when you\u2019re a secret from the world, then you are in great danger\u2026\n\nAndrew: \u2026make sure that your enemies know who you are, so get out there. William Thompson was initially resentful about this, but I think he\u2019s come to realize that this was actually the safest position for him to be in. Now, he\u2019s a public figure and it\u2019s going to be very, very difficult to deal with him in the way that they might otherwise have done.\n\nKimberly: I just wanted to say that I really appreciated what a strong case you made. It was really done like a legal case. And also naming names. I know that one of the things that this whole issue brings up for me is the issue of personal accountability on the part of the perpetrators, but also on the part of all of us. As we get informed, what do we do about that? Personally, I think with this issue, everything is at stake. Nuclear is the other issue that everything is at stake and I see this in the same way for all kinds of reasons we can get into, but I just wanted to acknowledge the value and importance of you naming the names because it comes down to personal decisions. Like what\u2019s the difference between someone seeing that data and saying we\u2019ve got to do something and say this or lets hide this and get rid of it? Those are personal choices and we need to be held accountable for our personal choices.\n\nI personally feel that every parent who vaccinated their child did so with the best of intentions. So, clearly, the case for education is important because we need to be educated about those decisions and not just take it for granted that if the uninformed or misguided doctor says something that we need to just go with that and not think for ourselves. We, with THRIVE, some people resisted naming the names, but the point was that these were people. These were people making decisions that impact all of our lives and they need to be held accountable just like we do and so I think you\u2019ve done a real service and I honestly believe that this film and your work are what is going to make a difference in stopping this dangerous use of vaccines on the human population.\n\nWe know from our research that this has been going on. As we did with THRIVE, we sort of did this in every sector and came up with \u201cWhoa!\u201d You start pulling on these threads and it\u2019s not a pretty picture and it\u2019s one that we need to get out there because, like you, Del, it\u2019s like you talking about having a debate between people who disagree. That\u2019s how we learn the best. Get people who disagree. Let\u2019s hear the experts talk about it and then make our own decision about it and that\u2019s why I knew back in the 70s, that my questions were met with shaming, just like you\u2019re talking about, this disinterest regarding safety. That\u2019s not the normal response. If things were on the up and up, you don\u2019t respond to an intelligent inquiry or naming a concern about safety with disregard, so I encourage everybody to see this movie and to share this movie, and to bring the information forward and the whole these people accountable, because I think personal accountability and not being able to hide behind the roles, either in corporations or government agencies, is how these things will change.\n\nDel: Absolutely right. I want to point out that in vaccine research, if you bring up the topic, obviously, you are shamed. When you think about it, we all hear the statement, \u201cThe science is settled.\u201d It\u2019s settled on vaccines. Vaccines are safe. If you\u2019ve ever taken a science class, 101, day one in that science class, what we know about science is it is never settled. By definition, science cannot be settled. You must always be an open question taking place. That\u2019s how science moves forward. That\u2019s how we get the Galileo\u2019s and the Einstein\u2019s. They get outside the box and dare to question the orthodox belief system.\n\nSo, when you hear this statement \u201cthe science is settled\u201d coming from people he thought were scientists, like Sanjay Gupta on CNN, or these people we respect, you have to then really become concerned. I want Americans to get back to asking questions. We must never let go of that. I say just interject the slightest bit of skepticism in this topic, please. Is it just possible that the most powerful lobby in this country, the pharmaceutical industry, is not telling us all of the truth and as they buy politicians and inject their own government officials, is it possible there\u2019s some corruption taking place? Is it possible that the same scientists that go through the same university process, funded by the pharmaceutical industries - all of these medical departments are being funded by this industry that are telling them that vaccines are safe - and then they only have two choices for jobs: they either work for the vaccine pharmaceutical industry makers or they work for the CDC in testing this. And when they\u2019re done at the CDC, they go over to the pharmaceutical industry and vice versa. Is it possible that in this revolving door with the amount of money going on and the government interests and the corporate interests, is there a possible chance that there\u2019s corruption taking place? Is it that hard to fathom? And then add to the fact that you\u2019re not being allowed to talk about it, Clearly we have an issue.\n\nSo, you\u2019re right. We do help the scientists. We do name their names because these people must be arrested. They must go to jail. This is one of the greatest human tragedies. It\u2019s a holocaust. Over a million children have lost their lives, their minds, to autism since this study came out and said that vaccines are safe. I\u2019m not saying all cases of autism are being caused by vaccines. I think that there are toxins in our food and many different reasons. But, when you look at the size of what\u2019s taking place and people like Coleen Boyle, who was a part of the study, has sat before the Congress time and time again knowing full well that she was involved in this fraud and said, under oath, in front of the Congress that vaccines do not cause autism, we have to do the same thing that they\u2019ve attempted to do by creating this fraud around Andy Wakefield. They\u2019ve scared every doctor from ever even looking at the safety of vaccines. We need to scare every scientist and let them know that you will never get away with this in the United States of America and we do this by naming their names and letting them stand trial for the greatest medical fraud the world has ever seen.\n\nFoster: And not only stand trial, but Kimberly and I have been enjoying sort of imagining what would follow a successful trial, not only potentially incarceration, but restitution, where the restitution of funds would go not to the government. A Big Pharma case was just settled for $70 million against Genentech and one other company recently and $63.2 million of the fines went to the government themselves. Most of the rest to the lawyers. But, we\u2019ve been imagining that these people would not only have to be working while they\u2019re in prison and the money goes to the victims, but also that they should need to, on a daily basis, actually need to talk with some of the parents and actually spend time changing the diapers of incapacitated young people and actually have to experience what they have caused through their selfishness, through their lack of compassion for the results of their actions.\n\nAnd if there are people listening to this who are thinking this is probably just still some sort of conspiracy theory or something like that, here\u2019s a few questions that I\u2019ve found myself asking\u2026 Why, if there\u2019s no corruption going on here, why do they actually change the numbers in the study in this one and many others? Why did they destroy the records? Why did they not test proactively for safety and in comparison to the non-vaccinated? Why did they lie about Vioxx and then threaten doctors who disagreed? Why is no one willing to debate Andy publicly? And why are those named in the film, why were they unwilling to come forward with you and do an interview to represent their side of the story if they feel that it was fine?\n\nBefore leaving that point, I want to say one other thing. If you feel this is just a bunch of conspiracy wackos who think like this, Gandhi wrote an entire book warning about the dangers of vaccines, particularly mandatory ones, and I found a quote from Thomas Jefferson from 1778 saying, \u201cIf people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as the souls who live under tyranny.\u201d\n\nDel: It\u2019s been prophesied by the great minds of our time. It\u2019s been thought about. We know the dangers of this and it\u2019s an incredibly dangerous moment. This next election is so important.\n\nYou have to see the film. Literally, almost every review of our film is a lie just on what it\u2019s about. You\u2019re not even being told what it\u2019s about. If you read a review and it doesn\u2019t mention the name Dr. William Thompson, the review is a lie. Our entire film is about a very specific scientist at the CDC and if you don\u2019t talk about that fact, then you\u2019re not reading a review. You\u2019re reading propaganda. That\u2019s what\u2019s really taking place here and I hope that my career as an Emmy-winning producer on a medical talk show for six years at least allows you to say, \u201cYou know what, this guy left his career. He left everything to go work with this guy, Andy Wakefield, and make this documentary. Why would he do that?\u201d Clearly, this isn\u2019t a lucrative operation.\n\nThe truth is so important and this election right now, I believe, is going to decide our fate. This is more than just childhood vaccines. I live in California where they\u2019ve just taken away all of our ability to exempt our children from a bloated vaccine schedule of roughly 72 vaccines, up from when we were kids to just getting 10, maybe 12. That\u2019s a whole other story, why we\u2019ve expanded that, but that\u2019s going to be spreading nationwide. And right behind mandatory vaccines for children is mandatory vaccines for adults. They\u2019re testing it with the VA insurance, saying they\u2019re not going to be insured as veterans until they get up on all of their vaccines and that will be the pilot program for a national adult vaccination program. I assure you this is in the works. There\u2019s 270 vaccines that are in the pipeline that you\u2019ve never heard of and you have an industry that\u2019s about to put a sitting president into place. And congressmen. And senators; all talking about the importance of mandating vaccines, taking away our choice.\n\nIn California, the government, now, realistically owns my baby. I do not. I\u2019m not allowed to raise that baby. They can inject that child with whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want and there\u2019s nothing I can say about it. In Oklahoma, they just tried to pass a law simply saying a parent should be allowed to see what\u2019s in the vaccine, list the ingredients, and that got vetoed. Why are we not allowed to see what\u2019s in the vaccines?\n\nWhether or not this is about microchips injected right now, if you give up that control over your skin, your body, it can be penetrated by the government. There is nothing that stops them from injecting whatever they want into you and your child. You\u2019re on the verge of becoming human ATM machines for the pharmaceutical industry. Hundreds of vaccines we are living just fine without, mandated by a government you are about to put into place, please, look into everyone you\u2019re about to elect and say how much pharmaceutical money are they taking because I believe this is the end of freedom and democracy as we know it on this one subject.\n\nKimberly: I really appreciate that and I appreciate your clarity and your passion and your articulation of it. And I know that given that the candidates, certainly Bernie and Clinton, are both for mandatory vaccines (and they have stated that they are), suggest that notion right there of whether or not it\u2019s voluntary participation is a huge one.\n\nI want to say that my hope has to do with something that I think every single person can do because to me organized people are the only thing more powerful than government or the money or the pharmaceuticals - the only thing. In the same way that it\u2019s like this pattern recognition that you describe. That\u2019s was absolutely what happened for us in our education and researching in what ended up becoming THRIVE. It was the pattern recognition. I used to say, \u201dWe should send this to some statistical analysis and see what are the chances that this could be happening randomly\u201d until finally I was just like again and again and again and then, I got it.\n\nBut, the one thing that every single person can do, whether you vote, whoever you are, is to listen differently when someone tells you something that shakes your worldview because one of the things that, you know, I cried listening to Polly in the movie say that a friend of hers had mentioned that there might be problems with vaccines the morning that she was going in to get it. And her initial response was \u201cthat\u2019s nuts\u201d. That has happened to everybody. In the course of our awakening, there\u2019s that first thing that somebody says that sounds outrageous, like that the CDC could be manipulating this data or these people who we\u2019ve entrusted our entire lives to we\u2019ve been born and raised with a certain belief about that they\u2019re here for us, and the earth shakes as our worldviews change.\n\nAnd they don\u2019t change overnight. They require that we are able to hold conflicting ideas in our minds and in our hearts at the same time. It may be maybe I\u2019m going into this appointment and doing what I\u2019m told, but maybe I need to look into this. I don\u2019t know yet. I am in a state of not knowing as I investigate this and choose for myself. The thing we can do is to greet each other differently because it\u2019s not just with vaccines. It\u2019s with money. It\u2019s with media. It\u2019s with education. The government. You name it. When you pull on the thread, it\u2019s a heart-wrenching and earth-shaking experience and I think that this notion of a hassle free zone, that we need to learn how to break out of this place, where if we stay right here, we think that it will be comfortable, but as every parent with an autistic child who just did what they thought they were supposed to be doing can say, this is not a trouble-free zone. This is the zone that either sacrifices our human experience as we\u2019ve known it and cherished it or not.\n\nSo, however we relate to the presidential candidates, which is one of the hottest topics, I am still a big believer in people, individuals, and it\u2019s because I think we can change this. The next time somebody says something that seems outlandish, wait a minute. Don\u2019t shut them up. Ask them how did they come to that? What makes you think that?\n\nI think one of the most challenging things about my experience in making THRIVE, I never expected the head of the Illuminati or the CDC to feel good about what I was doing. I didn\u2019t, however, worry about what an old friend would worry about thinking about me or my kids\u2019 friends\u2019 parents, what they were saying behind my back that ended up landing on my children. That\u2019s where the pain of all of this lives and that\u2019s what makes having courage harder to come by. I think more people would make courageous choices if our friends and family didn\u2019t make it so difficult for us. I really encourage individuals to just wait a minute and consider something different because everything is at stake in that and that is something that spans every religious, political, and other affiliation and just becomes part of what we need to do now in becoming responsible citizens and human beings.\n\nAndrew: I\u2019ll just say, very briefly, you\u2019re absolutely right. I used to say to my medical students when I was teaching, I\u2019d say, \u201cHalf of what I am telling you is right and half is wrong. The problem is I don\u2019t know which half is which. So, it\u2019s up to you to tell me.\u201d You can\u2019t be frightened. Doctors have to learn to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and they don\u2019t do that anymore and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nOn the film, you\u2019re quite right: organizing people, and this film acts as a rallying point for people. It\u2019s, in the 20 years I\u2019ve been in it, like nothing else I\u2019ve ever seen. People who were crossing the road to avoid each other within the movement are now coming together in a big, big way. (And a shout out to Polly and Brian Burrows, who were on the production team, but are not here today. They\u2019ve done a wonderful job.) It is a very powerful catalyst for change and it is a measure of how frightened the other side is of this film that they\u2019ve done everything they can to stop it getting out there, which has backfired in a huge way. But, they are terrified, believe me. Right now, they are terrified of this film because of the truth that it brings and the rallying point that it creates for a previously disjointed and disparate community, which is huge, which is absolutely huge.\n\nOne of the things that Del mentioned, which has really struck me on this tour as we finish going around with this film and doing exit interviews and talking to parents and filming their stories, is the number of deaths. I never imagined in my lifetime that there were so many deaths. The reason we didn\u2019t see this is because, of course, if your child dies, you don\u2019t come back to the doctor. There\u2019s no one to bring back to the doctor. If you\u2019re part of an autism community, then you have a community. You search for ways together to treat your children and to interact with each other about the diet or this or that or the other, but if your child dies, then you melt away and grieve and isolation. So it was never obvious. And then we said, and Polly in particular said, \u201cCome and tell me your stories\u201d. And for the first time in 5, 10,20 years, parents came forward and said this is what happened to my child and the doctor dismissed it as coincidence, or the doctor admitted it was the vaccine, but said they would never tell anyone that in public, or just the sheer number of deaths. A compelling reason to do what we do and really, just personally for me in all my experience, a terrible tragedy.\n\nFoster: On that note, I want to continue a little bit with what Kimberly was saying given a larger context from the THRIVE perspective and I want to make it very clear that I\u2019m representing my view and not Del\u2019s view or Andy\u2019s view on this. But, for people who are waking up to the larger picture, when you focus down the way this film does on a particular pattern of corruption in particular, in this case health, the results are so stunning. How can this possibly be? But, I\u2019ve spent the last 25 years looking at all of 12 major sectors of human endeavor and I was shocked to find not only is this true in every sector with the level of corruption and the violence and the suffering and so forth, but when you follow the money, as Kimberly taught me to do from her journalism background, it continues to lead to back to the same people and the same institutions. We\u2019ve seen this looking at food, looking at education, looking at finance, especially, because that\u2019s the one that allows them the power to do it in all the others. But also, in media. Also, in energy. Whistleblowers try to come out and they get slandered. Often times, they get killed.\n\nThe key point here is if you keep going back those streams into the headwaters you find, actually, that it\u2019s a relatively small number of people\u2026that this is a very old agenda, which sounds like a bad James Bond film. I can\u2019t not say that it has to do with a simple agenda to control the world and they do it through the media. They do it through propaganda and education. They do it through toxins in your food and water and your air. And they do it through controlling your bodies through a corrupt health system. And, that it\u2019s not just about money. That\u2019s how you manipulate the people who are actually imposing the agenda, But, the ones designing and funding the agenda are much higher on the ladder. They don\u2019t need money. They\u2019re the ones actually printing money.\n\nSo, what\u2019s their agenda? We lay it out in THRIVE that there is an agenda for control in the hands of real psychopaths and sociopaths who have risen to the tops of these various silos of power because of their willingness to sell out their integrity and they end up then just working for the agenda, what we call the Global Domination Agenda, not out of a sense of what\u2019s good for the patient. What\u2019s good for the students. What\u2019s good for the person needing the food. They\u2019re operating from this agenda of how can we take over peoples bodies, take over their property, take over their lives and then depopulate to a certain extent so they\u2019re easier to control.\n\nI\u2019m kind of stunned once again (though I would have anticipated in what you\u2019re saying, Andy) about not only is it the suffering and the sickness and the debilitation, but that there\u2019s this surfacing information about the number test. Well, I claim that is not unintentional. That\u2019s part of the same program with the wars, and the radiation, and the chemtrails, and the GMO\u2019s. Look at the effect that it\u2019s having and look who are the ones funding these and that will help us not only wake up to it in every sector, but to be willing to stand for the truth, join together effectively, and turn this around.\n\nI put you guys in the category of Manning, Asange, Snowden, Drake, Rife, and the other people who have really changed life for human beings by being willing to come forward and have your fidelity to reality and be willing to risk whatever it takes to actually stand for the truth.\n\nI know Kimberly wanted to ask you about what that\u2019s been like for you and then we\u2019ll go onto what can we all do about this.\n\nDel: I just sort of want to jump on a couple things you said and I think that\u2026I was just watching THRIVE again to remind myself of the work you\u2019ve done, because it had been some time, and I just thought we get this question a lot. Is there an agenda? Is there eugenics going on? What is the reason these vaccines would be so problematic? We sort of shy away from getting into that because, I say, what difference does it really make? You\u2019re being poisoned. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about and the reasoning, you know. But I have to say, watching THRIVE again, I thought I better turn this off or I\u2019m going to start this interview so angry.\n\nBut, you look at the future. The future of the pharmaceutical industry is vaccines and one of the things that Andy and I have been talking about is this HPV Gardasil vaccine. This is really sort of brand new. This is one of the first new vaccines on the market and you look at the problem of it \u2013 the shutdown of women\u2019s ovaries. We\u2019re destroying women\u2019s ovaries with this paralysis in women and you do have to wonder, if your agenda is to sort of bring population down, what a convenient side effect that one of the things these women are suffering is, really, the loss of their ovaries. It certainly is in my mind.\n\nI want to ask you a question though very quick because, in THRIVE, you\u2019ve covered sort of every sector. I say publicly that this film is another one of the stories we\u2019ve seen of the banking industry taking our houses and destroying the middle-class, energy, corporations that don\u2019t pay taxes, pollute, get away with it\u2026 this whole thing, and you\u2019ve covered it all. I\u2019m just curious, is there another topic, because I feel like, you know, I was a progressive liberal most of my life. They will talk about banking. You\u2019ve got the 1%. We\u2019re all willing to have that discussion. We\u2019ll talk about the environmental effects of the oil and gas industry and what seems to be sort of the of squashing of new energy systems. We\u2019ll talk about Monsanto and GMO foods and herbicides. But we cannot talk about vaccines. In your experience of discussing this, is there another topic that they\u2019ve so completely managed to make us terrified talk about?\n\nKimberly: I would say the hottest other topic has been the notion of true liberty to control our lives. That these issues, all of them, have to do with are we voluntarily able to make a choice about what we participate in, whether it\u2019s education, whether it\u2019s this kind of healthcare, whether it\u2019s this kind of vaccine? On any issue, what is our agency to determine our lives? We have what we call the zero-aggression or Non-Aggression Principle that guides all of the solutions that we see that transcend the political system and all the rest and come down to principles and the core principle, the one thing that every single person on the planet agrees to, is that they don\u2019t want to be violated against their will. Right? Some want to be violated, but not against their will. Some think that they should be able to violate others. But, the one bottom line and If you think about what that means, that there\u2019s actually something that everybody agrees to, that\u2019s huge.\n\nThat\u2019s the only thing that I know of that all people agree to and yet, when you actually carry that out and say if we could abide by that, everything would change. Right? So let\u2019s talk about that. Let's look at this because if we keep on doing this thing where we\u2019ve got one group in power that keeps dominating the rests and then that and then this, it\u2019s like this thing is so far down the wrong path that we actually need to unearth a completely different conversation the way we do with vaccines. This is not something to dabble in.\n\nSo, I think that you\u2019re onto, I mean, to me, I\u2019ll do anything for this movie and this message to get out because I think it is the critical issue that gives somebody a way to take this concept of liberty and put it down into a day-to-day action that affects the human population right now. It\u2019s whether or not we own our bodies. Do you have the right not to be violated against your will? And the fact that you can\u2019t even know what\u2019s in something that\u2019s now mandated to go into you, I mean, if you\u2019re for it, have it. That\u2019s not the point. The point isn\u2019t if you\u2019re for or against it. Are you able to make these choices for yourself?\n\nAnd that\u2019s the conversation that we\u2019re really exploring most deeply and it\u2019s the one that runs into the oversimplification of issues. This whole thing about pro or anti-vaccine. I remember when Clear Channel introduced this little three minute news synopsis in the classroom when my kids were in school and I said this is really dangerous. These issues can\u2019t be discussed in three minutes and I don\u2019t want my kids thinking they\u2019re informed because they got some propaganda blasted at them in three minutes. We need critical thinking.\n\nOne thing relates to another and critical thinking is the heart of it and my hope comes from people like you in the film that you made because it gives concrete actions that people can take any points out that there\u2019re things that each one of us can do, whatever your inclination, whatever your passion, whether you think vaccines are great, you want it, you want your kids to have it, you can still agree that it should be anybody\u2019s choice because sooner or later there will be an issue you don\u2019t want mandated, Whether this is it or not, that\u2019s guaranteed. These things only propel further, like with the chipping or whatever it is. My answer is it\u2019s whatever shakes your worldview and that you don\u2019t have the experience of critical thinking or the network of support.\n\nOne thing I just want to make sure to include is acknowledgment of your families and the people who have stood by you as you\u2019ve made these choices because those people are critical. I honestly don\u2019t know\u2026I couldn\u2019t have done what I\u2019ve done without Foster. I don\u2019t think he could have done what he\u2019s done without me. Just to be able to have that sanity and moral check that this is the right thing to do even though it means a lot of pain and hardship and risk.\n\nFoster: I totally agree with Kimberly is saying and I would just add one point before we go on to what we can do about it, which is in addition to this liberty principle which we\u2019ve found underlies all of the constructive solutions, it needs to be accompanied by personal liability. It\u2019s not that everybody can do whatever they want. They can do whatever they want as long as it doesn\u2019t harm anyone else\u2019s person or property. For instance, if you\u2019re free to choose the education of your choice, then you can walk away from a propagandized school and you don\u2019t have your money stolen to propagandize other children. In finance, if you have a true free market, you don\u2019t have to do anything that doesn\u2019t feel like a win-win situation to you and, if you do, if you commit counterfeit or fraud or something like that, you\u2019re personally liable. You\u2019re not protected by government or cronyism or for corporate limited liability or something like that. Obviously, it comes back to this vaccine issue, that if somebody wants to inject this kind of stuff into their own body, that\u2019s fine, but everyone should have truely, deeply informed consent. It simply comes back to the key word, is it voluntary or not?\n\nWith the time we have left, I\u2019d like to move in to \u2018what we can do about it?\u2019 I was thrilled to see how proactive you are being about that. It wasn\u2019t just during the credits, call your congressman, or something like that. You actually laid out the beginnings of a useful agenda and I saw, Del, in one of the interviews that you did when you were talking with the UC regents and then the interview that you did with ABC, it looks like that a bunch of these things are starting to happen already.\n\nAndy, I would really appreciate if you would start and lay out what you think would be the most effective steps, strategically, and then we\u2019ll move into, tactically, what can each one of us doing our own lives to help.\n\nAndrew: I\u2019ll be very brief, given the time we have left, but here are the action points on the film:\n\nWilliam Thompson must be called before Congress with his colleagues who committed the fraud, right up to the hierarchy of the CDC at the time, to tell the truth under oath. That\u2019s absolutely essential. That does not get beyond of the series of hearings though without the need for legislative action. So what needs to happen then is laws need to be enacted and laws need to be demolished. The 1986 Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, that needs to be demolished because it is iniquitous and extremely dangerous, giving indemnity to the pharmaceutical industry for the products that they make. The bill that needs to be enacted is, at the very least, a modification of the Weldon-Maloney bill to get vaccine safety science completely out of the CDC, completely out of the Health and Human Services, into an independent agency. Beyond that, vaccines must all be voluntary and their administration must be based on fully informed consent and that consent goes a lot, a lot further than what is given now.\n\nIn terms of the movie, there are two things that caused the success of this movie beyond it\u2019s withdrawal from Tribeca and thenDe Niro\u2019s endorsement of the film. It\u2019s the grassroots organizations, getting a grassroots mobilized to get to the theater, to get their friends and relatives to the theater. We now find a ratio of about 2/3, with about 2/3 of the audience to whom this is a new story and that is exactly the target audience.\n\nSo, the grassroots organizations being mobilized and the movie makers being there. One, two, three of us, all of us, being there to represent the movie and show not only do we care, but we want to go on answering questions on this. This is on a national stage at the moment. Del goes across the border to Calgary to take it into Canada in the next few days and then, it must move beyond that. I\u2019m writing up a template for India at the moment where there are 10.4 million children with autism with no infrastructure whatsoever and to take not only the film there, mobilize the grassroots organizations, get the team there, but to offer solutions for how they might deal with the autism problem going forward. So, not only to present the problem, but solutions to how to deal with that problem in a way that is manageable and tangible for people living in the circumstances that they live in and to use that template for going elsewhere in the world in a series of ambassadors to Vaxxed to coordinate these efforts with local distributors so that it actually is meaningful beyond just the film. It has to be meaningful to these people beyond the film so that those are where we really, really need help.\n\nFoster: I think you had also suggested, I remember from the film, that one easy step-not from the vaccine industries point of view, but a very concrete step - is just to make the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella separate vaccinations so that people aren\u2019t getting this triple threat and in such large doses. And then I think you also mentioned classifying vaccines as pharmaceutical drugs so that they would be tested accordingly rather than this kind of slippery slide in that the vaccine companies have now.\n\nDel: That\u2019s the most shocking discovery for me. I did not realize that vaccines are not been tested the same way drugs are. They aren\u2019t going through long-term safety tests with placebo-based studies. We are asking for one very simple study to be done and that\u2019s the vaccine versus unvaccinated population study. This is the easiest study you can do. Anytime someone tells me the studies prove vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, I say I want to see ones study. It\u2019s the study almost every drug we take goes through and that is what happens to the group that doesn\u2019t take the drug? That\u2019s just your basic scientific study. Half the group takes it, half doesn\u2019t. We know that every chiropractor in this country didn\u2019t vaccinate their child. Every one of them, I think, would put their children forward for a study to say, is the rate of autism among the unvaccinated 1 in 45. Is the rate of asthma up to 20, 30, 40%? Are there deadly food allergies? What is your rate of multiple sclerosis? What is your rate of ADD/ADHD? All of these questions, we could get that study done inside of a month and you have to ask yourself why isn\u2019t this CDC doing the most obvious, easy study known to man?\n\nI would say there\u2019s a lot to do here, but, for now, what were really asking people is go to our website, vaxxedthemovie.com. Be aware of where it\u2019s screening because every time we fill a theater, we open up in another city. Right now, what is giving us the power is the people, the people understanding this is an issue, and being in theaters gets what is spreading this message right now. It\u2019s so important that we continue to spread that message because that\u2019s why I got an hour and a half meeting with Jason Chaffetz in Washington DC. They are afraid of this film. They are afraid of the visibility and, as you know, once we\u2019re done with the theatrical run, that sort of sets your foundation, then when we drop online and make it available to every body, it\u2019s that many more people that knew to look for it. Right now, the protest is this film. And, bring your friends. See it. It\u2019s very clear. It\u2019s not what you\u2019re been told.\n\nI really want to speak to what Kimberly said that I think we get too caught up in who\u2019s the problem? Who\u2019s doing it? This is what the news has used against us. This is how they\u2019re manipulating us. They\u2019re making us argue each other over who\u2019s the problem instead of having conversation at our dinner tables, at the Thanksgiving tables, at our family gatherings, \u2018What are the issues?\u2019 I think, if you take away who\u2019s doing it, you start realizing, wait a minute, we are all actually in alignment on 90% of the problems in this country. We want liberty. We want control of our bodies and our lives. If we stop getting caught up in Fox telling me it\u2019s this guy and MSNBC telling me it\u2019s that guy and screaming about who\u2019s causing the problem, we realize we are the ones in power. We are the people of United States. We are the citizens that build this country, that make this country. We are the ones in control, but we have to talk. We have to open our minds. We have to be able to listen to the other side and what you\u2019re going to be surprised to find is that you actually agree more than you disagree. It\u2019s this idea that we\u2019re so opposed to each other that we shouldn\u2019t even bridge the conversation, that\u2019s where the media has won. That\u2019s where our government has won. That\u2019s where the corporations and the power systems are winning. They are teaching us to not talk to each other. Stop it! Talk! Communicate. That is the power of the people\n\nFoster: Thank you. In terms of what people can do to assist you with this, let me ask a few specific questions. First of all, if people want to send their friends to see the movie, where do they send them now? What\u2019s the status of that?\n\nDel: we are in 55 or, I think, 60 cities. We are opening up in six more we found out about yesterday. We are trying to get every market in the country, but the best way to follow that, because we are on the road, I can\u2019t even tell you the list is so long, but if you go to our website, you can see every theater we are opening in, where were going to be, and that\u2019s the best way to track where the film is coming and see where we\u2019re going to be doing Q and A\u2019s. Although I\u2019d caution people We really want to fill the theaters. Go opening night. Go to the second night. And then come back to see the Q and A, because it\u2019s the film. We worked for a year on every Word of this film. You don\u2019t need to hear us talk about it to get the power of it. So that\u2019s it. Go to the website. Check it out. And join our mailing list because we are using that to focus tactical approaches towards congress people that we know are wavering or that we are having influence on. I want you writing your politician and jumping in, but we can focus that if we can get to you and say, look it, \u201cright now contact this congressman right now\u201d, and we can only do that if you join our newsletter.\n\nKimberly: It\u2019s vaxxedthemovie.com and we will put a link to that below this blog and we\u2019ll also keep on posting about it and your work and your schedule through thrivemovement.com so anyone who signed up for us can stay connected to you also.\n\nFoster: And we\u2019ll put links to some of the other interviews that I had talked about. They\u2019re very powerful. Particularly, Del did an interview with ABC a night or two before the opening of the Tribeca Film Festival when he thought the film was still going to be in the festival, so it\u2019s particularly poignant. He\u2019s thanking them for their courage and so forth and then they totally chicken out on the whole thing, much to Robert De Niro\u2019s embarrassment and chagrin. But then, someone was recording his side of the interview so it\u2019s a fantastic talk that he gives of which ABC ended up using five seconds, but you can actually see behind the curtains to the rest of the picture, So we\u2019ll link to that and the UC Regents testimony and to our THRIVE blog on this topic, which gives a lot of the history back through Merck and I .G. Farbin and the Nazis and the Rockefellers to lay out a little more of the understanding of yes, people do this kind of thing and it can happen here. It already is happening here.\n\nMy last question before we wrap up is one of the things that\u2019s helped THRIVE spread around the world is we brought it out in 10 languages, dubbed, and then 17 other countries asked permission to translate it themselves and we gave them permission as long as they let us review the final product with an expert in that language to make sure that it still said what we wanted to say. Do you have any plans for translation because, obviously, vaccines are an issue all over the world?\n\nAndrew: Yes, we do and, in fact, it\u2019s being translated into Italian as we speak and into Spanish as we speak, so we\u2019re looking for help with translation elsewhere. We have a translator for Hindi in India, but if there are other people who are fluent and capable of doing this, that would be enormously helpful. Clearly, given the precise nature of the film and the importance of the language used, it has to be done to a very high degree of accuracy, but that notwithstanding, help on that would be gratefully received.\n\nFoster: After your theatrical screenings and film festivals and so forth, will the DVD be available then?\n\nDel: Yes, that\u2019s in development right now. We are just doing the finishing touches on the DVD. We are very soon going to be releasing it streaming online first and then the DVD will be behind it and then of course your usual suspects, the sort of on-demand approaches towards it. Absolutely, we plan on getting this into every household in this country and then around the world and that\u2019s going to be coming very soon. We want people in the theaters, but we also want to get it to the people, so we are working around the clock to make that happen at the right moment and the right time.\n\nFoster: Fantastic and, as Kimberly said earlier, we will do everything in our power to help you do exactly that.\n\nKimberly: I just have to say, Andrew, I am so grateful that in the face of the personal attacks and the pain of dealing with that, that your response has been this: to mobilize such an intelligent, effective, engaging way for people to recognize not only the validity of what you\u2019ve been doing all along, but the absolute critical nature of this issue. When you see people sometimes, they don\u2019t have what it takes to get through the level of onslaught that you\u2019ve experienced and they end up depressed and quiet and that you\u2019ve been able to respond in this way, the best imaginable response, and I\u2019m so grateful to it and I have thought many times about the people who are called out in this and I\u2019m really, really grateful that it will be that people will recognize that they will be held accountable for the decisions that they\u2019re making, including the slandering of people who are devoting their lives and expertise to unpacking these important issues. So, thank you for whatever it is in you allowed you to stay with it and come back in such a constructive way. And also, Del, to you for your passion and competence.\n\nAs producer and director of THRIVE, I also just want to say I know what goes into producing and directing movies and I think you did a fantastic job. I\u2019ll be in touch outside of this to see ways in which we might help with promotion and everything else that we can do to help spread this most important film that you\u2019ve made.\n\nFoster: I echo all of that and I\u2019d just like to close by giving you each, starting with Del, an opportunity to just offer a succinct, core message to our network and all of the people beyond that this recording will go to.\n\nDel: I would just say that the time is now. This nation needs every one of us. It\u2019s we, the people, of the United States of America. We are looking at the corporate takeover of our country, of our government, and we have got to stand together now. We have got to see the similarities in all of these issues, that not one of them stands free of corporate influence. This is just another story like the others, but it is a very powerful story because we have an insider. We really have an inside voice showing how the government is colluding with corporate interests and this time they\u2019re poisoning our children. They\u2019re destroying the lives of families across this country and across the world. So, please see the movie. See it for yourself. Take the information and then stand with us. Tell your story. Tell the truth. We need to use social media because our media is leaving us in the dark. And, I would just say, know that you are a powerful, incredible being designed by evolution or God (owever you want to look at it), but we are perfectly created beings with incredible minds and incredible understanding. We just need to stand together and realize our power and nothing can stop us.\n\nFoster: Well said. Thank you.\n\nAndrew: I have two comments in addition to that. I think Kimberly captured it in her opening statement about the voice inside her when she went to the doctor and said, \u201cDo not do this. There is something wrong.\u201d Mothers need to trust that instinct. It is the most powerful force on earth. It is the reason that we are here now - not medicine, not public-health, but the maternal instinct. The innate knowledge of when your child is ill and when they\u2019re well and that, please, trust that voice.\n\nThe other is for the medical profession because they don\u2019t get off scot-free at all. I\u2019ve heard so many stories about the appalling ethical violations committed by my colleagues during the course of the screening of this film. Doctors need to understand that we don\u2019t understand, that we don\u2019t know, that it\u2019s okay to say \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 and it\u2019s certainly important to say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and not only \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, but \u2018I won\u2019t do that again\u2019. We need to go back to trusting in parents. The art of medicine, and that\u2019s where it begins, the art of medicine is taking a history and examining the patient, listening to the story. What happened to this child? That is the beginning.\n\nThose are my two messages. Beyond that we are enormously grateful for you having us on the show and for your offers of help going forward and, as Del said, \u201cnow is the time\u201d. We may never get another time like this in our history, so we seize it or we do not at our peril.\n\nFoster: So well said. Thank you so much. My message to our network would be, \u2018see this film\u2019. It\u2019s not an easy film to watch, but it\u2019s a wonderful and profound and life-changing film to watch. And then have the courage to tell your friends about it. And as all of this is happening, eventually this will be on DVD and you can hold the home screenings and invite your friends in, watch it, and then, discuss it together. And then, organize in your communities, in your parent associations, at your schools. And talk to your politicians, but don\u2019t expect that they\u2019re going to handle it on their own. Keep going no matter what. Just include them in the conversation. And then, this will be available on iTunes and Hulu and on the Internet, streaming, and so forth. Just keep spreading the word because this kind of transformation is critical and starts with the truth and these guys have been willing to seek it, to find it, and to tell it so beautifully.\n\nThank you all. I really appreciate it. Good luck with your tour.\n\nKimberly: Yes. Thank you so much. We\u2019ll be in touch for sure.", "opengraph": {"type": "cause", "site_name": "Who Owns Your Body? | Thrive", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/thrivemovementassets/resources/images/000/001/613/original/Screen_Shot_2016-07-01_at_9.40.47_PM.png", "title": "Who Owns Your Body?", "url": "http://www.thrivemovement.com/who-owns-your-body.blog", "description": "Do you own your body?
