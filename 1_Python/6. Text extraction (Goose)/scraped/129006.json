Researchers are now pushing wildlife officials to actively manage forests rather than just identify threatened areas.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada region stretches across 27 million acres of land that is abundant with wildlife and various kinds of trees.\n\nThe region, which spreads from Lake Tahoe in the north to the Sequoia National Forest in the south, has been hit by constant drought, leaving pines more exposed to wildfires and bark beetle invasions.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2020, 30 percent of conifer forests in the southern Sierra Nevada have died due to these threats. During the same time, 85 percent of the region\u2019s dense mature forests have either died or substantially thinned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a wakeup call, even to those of us that are kind of steeped in this field. We\u2019re moving from knowing this is a problem to quantifying the problem,\u201d Zackary Steel, a postdoctoral researcher at UCB and lead author of the study, told the Sacramento Bee. (Related: Human intervention has made forests less resistant to drought, pests, wildfire.)\n\nSierra Nevada wildfires becoming bigger and more severe\n\nThe Sierra Nevada Conservancy mentioned that wildfires are becoming bigger and more severe now than before.\n\nSuch destructive fires include the 2021 Caldron Fire that burned 221,835 acres in the Eldorado National Forest and other areas of the Sierra Nevada in El Dorado, Amador and Alpine County.\n\nThese areas once displayed abundant evergreens growing from the ground, but after the Caldron fire the only thing apparent is a desolate landscape.\n\n\u201cFires like the Dixie, Caldor, Creek and North Complex have devastated communities and caused significant damage to the resources the region provides, including water, wildlife habitat, recreational access and carbon storage,\u201d Sierra Nevada Conservancy said in a statement.\n\n\u201cImpacts from large, damaging wildfires in the Sierra are felt across the state as they degrade air quality, jeopardize the state water system, and offset progress towards California\u2019s air quality and climate goals.\u201d\n\nThe freshly pruned conifer forests rose from 25 percent in 2011 to 33 percent in 2020, while recently burned mature forests grew from seven percent to 20 percent over the same time.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada region plays a crucial role in California\u2019s water system, with more than 75 percent of the state\u2019s residents getting their drinking water from the area.\n\nSnowpack is critical for water storage, with the Sierra forests and meadows playing significant roles in assuring water quality and dependability.\n\nBut the quantity and quality of water from the Sierra Nevada headwaters are endangered by congested forests, deteriorated meadows and a changing climate.\n\nCongested forests also endanger the water supply infrastructure. They are also less flexible to drought, beetle invasion and wildfire. The result is unparalleled tree mortality in the Sierra Nevada with 129 million killed by beetles and drought alone since 2010.\n\nForests of dead trees present many challenges for water management \u2013 from a rise in flooding and landslides to a decrease in water quality and reservoir capacity.\n\nFollow Environ.news for more news about natural disasters.\n\nWatch the video below about the California wildfire allegedly started by a pyrotechnic device.\n\nThis video is from the ZGoldenReport channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMega forest fires found to be worsened by incompetent government regulation and mismanagement of forests.\n\nLos Angeles desperately trying to meet water demand as drought continues to threaten future supplies.\n\nStudy: Demand for biodiesel in Europe has caused huge areas of forest land to disappear.", "opengraph": {"title": "Nearly a third of Sierra Nevada\u2019s conifer forests destroyed by drought, wildfires", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2022-11-07-third-of-sierra-nevada-conifer-forests-destroyed.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "Natural disasters such as drought and wildfires that plagued California for more than a decade have destroyed 30 percent of the Sierra\u00a0Nevada\u00a0conifer forests.
