In other words, myocarditis could not be associated with abnormal autoantibodies, viral infections other than SARS-CoV-2, or excessive production of antibodies elicited by the mRNA vaccine. \n\n \n\n In vaccinated patients, infection with the virus was not likely to be a cause or contributing factor for myocarditis since anti-Nucleoprotein IgG was not found in these patients. \n\n \n\n In contrast to controls, the finding of high levels of unbound full-length spike protein in myocarditis patients may point to the mechanism by which this condition arises. Similarly, MIS-C patients had circulating SARS-CoV-2 antigens. \n\n \n\n The spike protein appears to evade immune antibodies found at normal levels in these patients, with adequate functional and neutralization capacity. The spike may damage the cardiac pericytes or endothelium, perhaps by reducing the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), reducing nitric oxide production in the endothelium, or activating inflammation via integrins, causing the endothelium to become abnormally permeable\n\nedit on 27-2-2023 by Asmodeus3 because: (no reason given)\n\n\n\nTaipei, Feb 26Another sad story of a young girl in Taiwan in the age group 5-11 who has died due to vaccine-induced myocarditis caused by the Pfizer vaccine. A very well known severe adverse reaction from the mRNA products of Pfizer and Moderna and an unnecessary risk taken to vaccinate a child who belongs to an age group that has miniscule risks from SARS-CoV-2 and much more to loose from injecting untested, experimental, and as proven potentially hazardous and lethal products.The family of the girl is to receive the highest compensation paid for the death of a child which was caused by the mRNA product by Pfizer and amounts to about $114K US Dollars. Of course life doesn't have a price but at least the State has recognised that this is the most likely cause of her death.Note that in the article there are attempts by the author to cast doubt on what has caused the death of the girl. The usual vaccine apologetics and denialism of reality but it's rather desperate at this point to try to defend the vaccines and the pharmaceuticals.It is well known that almost in every case of myocarditis post vaccination the reason behind the development of the condition is the free spike protein from the vaccine and not any viral infection, including infection with SARS-COV-2. Something that vaccine apologists don't really know or don't want to know...Here is the peer-reviewed publication from another thread I made sometime agoIn a few words, one of the major differences between those adolescents and young adults who developed myocarditis post vaccination and those who didn't develop the condition, was the presence or the absence of free spike antigens respectively in the blood of those individuals.The above study is a bombshell and puts an end to the attempts made to blame everything else in the world but not these hazardous products.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats17.jpg", "title": " Family of girl who died due to the Pfizer vaccine to receive the highest compensation so far, page 1", "description": " Family of girl who died due to the Pfizer vaccine to receive the highest compensation so far, page 1", "site_name": "AboveTopSecret.com"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202302260005", "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
