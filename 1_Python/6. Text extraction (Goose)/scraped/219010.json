Our previous dog had 13 years of bliss, and we felt we wanted to give Molly a good end of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer skin was tough and rough like elephant skin, she stank, and there were chunks of fur coming off all over the house,\u201d he said.\n\nThey had to wash her every day and give her special medication.\n\n\u201cThere were times when we thought: \u2018What have we done?\u2019 But then we remember what someone had done to her and how she deserved a happy and healthy life,\u201d added John.\n\nBut today, Molly-Moo is a happy dog with a loving home.\n\nHer fur has now healed and grown back.\n\n\u201cWe can let her off the lead, and she toddles around the park socializing with other dogs,\u201d the owner said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really turned a corner and is very happy, sweet-natured, and well-behaved.\"\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an older girl, but it doesn\u2019t stop her bounding around through the grass; it\u2019s an absolute joy to see. She never goes far, though; she won\u2019t leave my side. I\u2019ve definitely found a best friend for life, and she has too!\u201d\n\n[READ MORE] Dogs Can Recognize a 'Bad Person' By Facial Expressions, Study Says", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://neonnettle.com/features/1951-elderly-abandoned-dog-finds-loving-home-just-in-time-for-christmas", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/features/images/dog-abandonded-finds-home.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Elderly Abandoned Dog Finds Loving Home Just in Time for Christmas", "description": "The dog, named Molly-Moo was found by West Midlands Police - An elderly German shepherd-mastiff mix was found abandoned on the streets of Birmingham, UK, just... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Dogs", "Animals"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["../../features/1604-dogs-can-recognize-a-bad-person-by-facial-expressions-study-says"], "authors": ["Neon Nettle"], "publish_date": "2021-12-26"}
