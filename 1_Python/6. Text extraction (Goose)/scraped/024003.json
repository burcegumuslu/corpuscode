Mond, Privy Counsellor, founder of the Pilgrims Society, organizer of the First Imperial Press Conference, 1909, co-founder of MI6, MI5, GC&CS now GCHQ, Pres. Of British Zionist Foundation, Institute and Marks & Spencer founders Chaim Weizmann and Sir Israel Sieff, Minister of Health (1916-1921)\n\nHere are several Parliamentary photos at the National Portrait Gallery identifying Alfred Mond: Photo One, hover your mouse over the last man in the back on the right here, it identifies Mond. Here is written evidence of Alfred Mond at the First Imperial Press Conference, 1909\u2014where global FAKE NEWS, PROPAGANDA & FALSE INTELLIGENCE was CREATED. See also two-page scan of Parliament of the Press, 1909 document (p. 44) immediately following.\n\nSee mentions of Mond at Thomas H. Hardman, ed. pub. (Jun. 05-26, 1909).

UK Parliamentary Archives.\n\nOther AstraZeneca directors have included HOLDERS OF THE MONARCH\u2019S GOLDEN CONTROL SHARES like Sir Richard Greenbury, Sir Denys Hartley Henderson, Jean-Philippe Courtois.\n\nThese men are all closely tied to Rothschild biotechnology companies, QinetiQ space wars (Monarch\u2019s Golden Share controlled \u2013 director Denys Henderson, also a director in MORI opinion firm), Bill Gates Foundation / Microsoft, World Economic Forum (Davos), Rio Tinto (Monarch\u2019s Golden Share controlled), Carlyle Group (C.I.A.\u2014first QinetiQ funder), SERCO (Monarch\u2019s Golden Share controlled), The Weizmann Institute (Pirbright clone, Marks & Spencers), Zionists Chaim Weizmann and Israel M. Sieff.\n\nLord Victor Rothschild heavily funded the start of modern biotechnology after his self-serving Rothschild Report UK (1971). His company Biotechnology Investments Limited (BIL) invested in numerous companies involved with AstraZenca. Among them were Amgen and Genzyme. This is an Excel spreadsheet on BIL. Check your downloads folder.\n\nThe relationships are convoluted (like everything globalist lawyers and bankers touch) to discourage investigations into the Rothschild involvement in AstraZeneca.\n\nAstraZeneca is a dangerous, globalist company established by Pilgrims Society co-founder Sir Alfred Mond as Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) to develop a monopoly for the British Empire in the chemical business, then expand into pharmaceuticals, just like Wellcome Fund then and now.\n\nThe founder of the ICI spin out of AstraZeneca, Sir Denys Hartley Henderson, is most definitely a keeper of the Crown\u2019s Golden Shares of control over key industries. After founding AstraZeneca, he went on to partner with the C.I.A. in 2003 to found QinetiQ that today has over $8 billion in U.S. military and civilian contracts, not counting another $9 billion to SERCO, its parallel, Queen-controlled company.\n\nThe facts tell us that AstraZeneca is a Pilgrims Society corporation under the British Monarch. It cannot be trusted to respect the sovereignty of countries, including the United States, and therefore, this AstraZeneca rush for a vaccine and global distribution deals should be terminated in all countries, including the United States.\n\nWe believe we are observing in the selection of British-controlled AstraZeneca a plan to poison the planet to fulfill the Pilgrims Society\u2019s long-time plan for 90%+ population reduction.\n\nThis article triggered our research into AstraZeneca::", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "British Plan to Poison Humanity", "url": "https://aim4truth.org/2020/06/15/british-plan-to-poison-humanity/", "description": "GLOBAL HEALTH THREAT: We believe we are observing in the selection of British-controlled AstraZeneca a plan to poison the planet to fulfill the Pilgrims Society\u2019s long-term plan for 90%+ population\u2026", "article:published_time": "2020-06-15T20:06:55+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-06-20T11:42:22+00:00", "site_name": "American Intelligence Media", "image": "https://aim4truth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rothschild-nm-victor.jpg", "image:width": "250", "image:height": "325", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1993-06-17-ASTRAZENECA-GROUP-PLC-Co-No-02723534-List-of-particulars-initial-public-offering-underwritten-by-Warburg-Barclays-Goldman-Sachs-Companies-House-(UK)-May-17-1993.pdf", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Mond,_1st_Baron_Melchett", "https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw212340/Imperial-Press-Conference-Luncheon-Party-at-the-House-of-Commons?LinkID=mp03047&search=sas&sText=alfred+mond&role=sit&rNo=2", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1909-06-07-Luncheon-Party-at-the-House-of-Commons-Benjamin-Stone-photog-Imperial-Press-Conference-1909-HC-LB-1-111-20-69-UK-Parliamentary-Archives-Jun-07-1909.pdf", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1909-06-05-A-PARLIAMENT-OF-THE-PRESS-THE-FIRST-IMPERIAL-PRESS-CONFERENCE-1909-with-Pref-by-Earl-of-Rosebery-Thomas-H-Hardman-London-Horace-Marshall-and-Son-Jun-05-26-1909.pdf#page=44", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1909-06-05-A-PARLIAMENT-OF-THE-PRESS-THE-FIRST-IMPERIAL-PRESS-CONFERENCE-1909-by-Thomas-H-Hardman-Horace-Marshall-248-pgs-Jun-05-1909.pdf", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1909-06-05-A-PARLIAMENT-OF-THE-PRESS-THE-FIRST-IMPERIAL-PRESS-CONFERENCE-1909-by-Thomas-H-Hardman-Horace-Marshall-248-pgs-Jun-05-1909.pdf#page=55", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1909-06-07-Luncheon-Party-at-the-House-of-Commons-Benjamin-Stone-photog-Imperial-Press-Conference-1909-HC-LB-1-111-20-69-UK-Parliamentary-Archives-Jun-07-1909.pdf", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Greenbury", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denys_Henderson", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Courtois", "https://americans4innovation.blogspot.com/2020/02/coronavirus-uncovers-rothschild-lord.html", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/2003-05-29-Denys-Hartley-Henderson-QINETIQ-HOLDINGS-LIMITED-Co-No-4586941-Appointment-of-director-Form-288a-Companies-House-(UK)-May-29-2003.pdf", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos_MORI", "https://americans4innovation.blogspot.com/2018/04/the-shadow-government-uses-ses-serco.html", "https://americans4innovation.blogspot.com/2020/04/part-1-rca-nbc-founder-pilgrim-david.html", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/2020-06-15-AstraZeneca-plc-Overview-Wikipedia-accessed-Jun-15-2020.pdf", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1983-09-09-BIOTECHNOLOGY-(Victor-Rothschild)-INVESTMENTS-LIMITED-BIL-UNQUOTED-BIOTECH-STOCKS-p-12-Financial-Times-Sep-09-1983.xlsx", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1993-06-17-ASTRAZENECA-GROUP-PLC-Co-No-02723534-List-of-particulars-initial-public-offering-underwritten-by-Warburg-Barclays-Goldman-Sachs-Companies-House-(UK)-May-17-1993.pdf#page=5", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1993-06-17-ASTRAZENECA-GROUP-PLC-Co-No-02723534-List-of-particulars-initial-public-offering-underwritten-by-Warburg-Barclays-Goldman-Sachs-Companies-House-(UK)-May-17-1993.pdf#page=138", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1993-06-17-ASTRAZENECA-GROUP-PLC-Co-No-02723534-List-of-particulars-initial-public-offering-underwritten-by-Warburg-Barclays-Goldman-Sachs-Companies-House-(UK)-May-17-1993.pdf#page=62", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1993-06-17-ASTRAZENECA-GROUP-PLC-Co-No-02723534-List-of-particulars-initial-public-offering-underwritten-by-Warburg-Barclays-Goldman-Sachs-Companies-House-(UK)-May-17-1993.pdf#page=40", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denys_Henderson", "https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/2020-06-13-AstraZeneca-agrees-to-make-COVID-19-vaccine-for-Europe-by-Danica-Kirka-Medical-press-Jun-13-2020.pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-06-15T20:06:55+00:00"}
