A lot more than we usually do. There\u2019s an apocalypse of sorts going on there, if the popular media is to be believed. But as is often the case, these reports are devoid of any context or perspective.\n\nWhile the world\u2019s media can\u2019t get enough of India today, in its rush to support a narrative of terror about Covid-19, twelve years ago when there was a real story going on there, the world\u2019s media was nowhere to be seen.\n\nIn 2009, a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) funded NGO carried out unauthorised clinical trials of a vaccine on some of the poorest, most vulnerable children in the world. It did so without providing information about the risks involved, without the informed consent of the children or their parents and without even declaring that it was conducting a clinical trial.\n\nAfter vaccination, many of the participating children became ill and seven of them died. Such were the findings of a parliamentary committee charged with investigating this wretched affair. The committee accused the NGO of \u201cchild abuse\u201d and produced a raft of evidence to back up its claim. This entire incident barely registered on the radar of Western media.\n\nPATH (formerly the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) is a Seattle based NGO, heavily funded by BMGF but which also receives significant grants from the US government. Between 1995 and the time of writing (May 2021), PATH had received more than $2.5bn from BMGF.\n\nIn 2009, PATH carried out a project to administer the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The project\u2019s aim was, in PATH\u2019s own words, \u201cto generate and disseminate evidence for informed public sector introduction of HPV vaccines\u201d. It was conducted in four countries: India, Uganda, Peru and Vietnam. Another Gates-funded organization, Gavi, had originally been considered to run the project, but responsibility was ultimately delegated to PATH. The project was directly funded by BMGF.\n\nSignificantly, each of the countries selected for the project had a different ethnic population and each had a state-funded national immunisation program. The use of different ethnic groups in the trial allowed for comparison of the effects of the vaccine across diverse population groups (ethnicity being a factor in the safety and efficacy of certain drugs).\n\nThe immunisation programs of the countries involved provided a potentially lucrative market for the companies whose drugs were to be studied: should the drugs prove successful and be included on these countries\u2019 state-funded national immunisation schedules, this would represent an annual windfall of profits for the companies involved.\n\nTwo types of HPV vaccine were used in the trial: Gardasil by Merck and Cervarix by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). In this article, we are going to examine PATH\u2019s trial of Gardasil in India.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here the relationship between BMGF and one of the companies whose drugs were being tested. In 2002, BMGF had, controversially, bought $205m worth of stocks in the pharmaceutical sector, a purchase which included shares in Merck & Co. The move had raised eyebrows because of the obvious conflict of interest between the foundation\u2019s role as a medical charity and its role as an owner of businesses in the same sector.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported, in August 2009, that the foundation had sold its shares in Merck between 31st March and 30th June of that year, which would have been around the same time that the field trials of the HPV vaccine were starting in India. So for the entirety of this project (which was already in operation by October 2006), right up to its final field trials, BMGF had a dual role: as both a charity with a responsibility for care, and as a business owner with a responsibility for profit.\n\nSuch conflicts of interest have been a hallmark of BMGF since 2002. When Gates was making regular TV appearances last year to promote Covid-19 vaccination, giving especially ringing endorsements of the Pfizer-BioNTech effort, his objectivity was never brought into question. Yet his foundation is the part-owner of several vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer, BioNTech and CureVac.\n\nHPV vaccine aims to prevent cervical cancer. Gardasil had been launched successfully by Merck in the US in 2006, but its sales suffered after a series of articles in American medical journals had judged that its risks outweighed its benefits. Especially damaging was an analysis of reports made to the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) about adverse reactions to Gardasil.\n\nThis analysis was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on August 19th 2009. The 12,424 adverse reactions which had been reported included 772 which were considered serious, 32 of which were deaths. Other reported serious side effects included autoimmune disorders, venous thromboembolic events (blood clots) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\nIn the same edition of JAMA, Dr. Charlotte Haug, then editor-in-chief of the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association, wrote,\n\nDr. Haug also noted, \u201cWhen weighing evidence about risks and benefits, it is also appropriate to ask who takes the risk, and who gets the benefit\u201d, in a clear dig at Gardasil manufacturer Merck.\n\nMerck\u2019s attempts to promote Gardasil had been controversial. Dr. Angela Raffle, one the UK\u2019s leading experts on cervical cancer screening, described Merck\u2019s marketing strategy as \u201ca battering ram at the Department of Health and carpet bombing on the peripheries.\u201d\n\nDr. Raffle was concerned that the push to mass vaccination would harm the successful screening programme which had operated in the UK since the 1960s.\n\nProfessor Diane Harper, then of Dartmouth Medical School in New Hampshire, had led 2 trials of the vaccine and was adamant that Gardasil could not protect against all strains of HPV.\n\nWhen Merck launched a huge public relations campaign in 2007 to persuade European governments to use the product to vaccinate all the continent\u2019s young girls against cervical cancer, she said:\n\nSo at the time that PATH was carrying out its trials in India, Uganda, Peru and Vietnam, Gardasil was a controversial vaccine: its safety, efficacy and Merck\u2019s attempts to promote it were being questioned, not by \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d, but by the international medical establishment and the respected mainstream media.\n\nKhammam district, in 2009, was a part of the eastern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (boundary changes made in 2014 mean that today Khammam district belongs to the state of Telangana). The region is predominantly rural and is considered to be one of the poorest and least developed parts of India.\n\nKhammam is home to several ethnic tribal groups,with some estimates putting its tribal population at about 21.5% (approximately 600,000 people). As is common for indiginous people throughout the world, the tribal groups of Khammam suffer from a lack of access to education. Consequently, their level of literacy is of a standard considerably lower than that of the region as a whole.\n\nSome 14,000 girls were injected with Gardasil in Khammam district during 2009. The girls recruited for PATH\u2019s project were between 10 and 14 years of age and all came from low-income, predominantly tribal backgrounds. Many of the girls did not reside with their families; instead they lived in ashram pathshalas (government-run hostels), which were situated close to the schools the children attended.\n\nProfessor Linsey McGoey, of the University of Essex, later stated she believed girls at ashram pathshalas had been targeted for the project as this was a way of:\n\nAlthough we have seen a lot of India in the news recently, coverage of this country and its affairs is usually low-key. Despite being home to almost one fifth of the world\u2019s population, reporting on India is sparse.\n\nFew of us are aware, for example, of its abysmal history of health and safety or its long-standing tradition of corruption in government.\n\nSuch failings have been taken advantage of by unscrupulous profit-seekers for decades. Western media only reports on the consequences of these actions when their magnitude is too great to ignore.\n\nWe learned that up to 7,000 people were killed and more than half a million were injured after being exposed to deadly methyl isocyanate gas, following a gas leak at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal. But we learned nothing in the years leading up to it of the culture of poor standards and disregard for regulation which was ultimately responsible for the disaster.\n\nSo it was typical that PATH\u2019s project to administer and study the effects of the HPV vaccine went unheralded in the West. Typical, too, that the same was true in India itself: the Indian media is no more renowned for its reporting on tribal groups than the Western media is for its coverage of Indians. Despite concerns expressed about the project in October 2009 by Sama, a Delhi-based NGO that advocates for women\u2019s health, the matter remained absent from India\u2019s news.\n\nThis project, then, couldn\u2019t have been more off-the-map had it taken place on the moon, and it remained so for several months until, early in 2010, stories began to filter out from Khammam that something had gone terribly wrong: many of the girls who had been involved in the trials had subsequently fallen ill and four of them had died.\n\nIn March 2010, members of Sama visited Khammam to find out more about the emerging stories. They were told that up to 120 girls had experienced adverse reactions, including epileptic seizures, severe stomach ache, headaches and mood swings. The Sama representatives remained in Khammam to investigate the situation further.\n\nThe involvement of Sama finally brought the matter to the attention of the Indian media and, amid a barrage of negative publicity, the Indian Council of Medical Research (IMCR) suspended the PATH project.\n\nAt this point the Indian Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Health began an investigation into the affair.\n\nOn May 17th, Sama produced a damning report highlighting, among other things: that the trials had been promoted as a government immunisation programme and not a research project, that the girls had not been made aware that they could choose not to participate in the trials, and that parental consent had neither been asked for nor given in many cases.\n\nSama also disputed the Andhra Pradesh State Government\u2019s claim that the deaths of four of the girls who had participated in the trials had nothing to do with vaccination.\n\nThe wheels of bureaucracy are slow to turn. It was more than three years later, on 30th August 2013, when the report of the Indian Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Health was finally published. Although many had expected the report to be a whitewash, it was anything but: it made for shocking reading.\n\nThe report excoriated both PATH and the IMCR, concluding that the \u201csafety and rights of children were highly compromised and violated.\u201d The committee found that PATH, despite operating in India since 1999, had no legal permission to do so. It noted that although the organisation had finally received a certificate from India\u2019s Registrar of Companies in September 2009, this certificate itself was in breach of the law.\n\nThe committee charged that PATH had lied to it and had attempted to mislead it during the course of its investigation and recommended that the Indian Government report PATH\u2019s violations of human rights to the WHO, UNICEF and the US Government.\n\nThe report declared that PATH\u2019s whole scheme was a cynical attempt to ensure ongoing profits for Merck and GSK.\n\nIt went on:\n\nThese charges were echoed by leading voices in India\u2019s medical community. \u201cIt is shocking to see how an American organization used surreptitious methods to establish itself in India,\u201d said Chandra M.Gulhati, editor of India\u2019s influential Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, \u201c(this) was not philanthropy\u201d.\n\nSamiran Nundy, editor emeritus of the National Medical Journal of India and a long-standing critic of corrupt practices in health, did not mince his words:\n\nThe standing committee\u2019s report was also highly critical of the relationship between PATH and members of several of India\u2019s health agencies, highlighting multiple conflicts of interest.\n\nOn the issue of informed consent, the committee confirmed the allegations made by Sama to be true, finding that the majority of consent forms weren\u2019t signed by either the children or their parents, that many consent forms were postdated or not dated at all, that multiple forms had been signed by the same people (often the caretakers of the hostels the girls lived in) and that many signatures didn\u2019t match the name on the form. It found that parents had not been given information on the necessity of vaccination, its pros and cons or its potential side effects.\n\nNo insurance was provided for any of the children in the event of injury and \u201cPATH did not provide for urgent expert medical attention in case of serious adverse events.\u201d\n\nFurther, PATH seriously contravened Indian health regulations by carrying out a clinical trial of a drug on children before first conducting a trial of the drug with adults as subjects.\n\nRegarding the girls who had died, the committee criticized PATH, Indian medical authorities and the Andhra Pradesh State Government for summarily dismissing the link between their deaths and vaccination without conducting thorough investigations. By 2016, some 1,200 of the girls who had been subjects in the two HPV vaccine trials in India were reporting serious long-term side effects, more than 5% of the total cohort of 23,500. By then, the total number of deaths had risen to seven.\n\nThis appalling breach of medical ethics and human rights went almost completely unmentioned outside India. The Indian Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Health had literally accused an American NGO of child abuse, providing extensive evidence to support their charge, yet practically no mention of this was to be found anywhere in the Western media.\n\nPopular science publications Nature and Science each contained a brief article about the debacle, but neither goes into any detail about PATH\u2019s legal and ethical breaches. While the Science article is at least slightly critical, the Nature piece gives more space to a rebuttal of the charges by PATH director Vivien Tsu.\n\nThe way in which media around the world is funded by BMGF, and how this affects reporting about BMGF and the organisations it sponsors, deserves its own article. But it\u2019s worth mentioning here that the BBC has received a total of $51.7m from BMGF, as of May 2021, and The Guardian has received $12.8m.\n\nThe Guardian, for all its claims to give a voice to the most vulnerable in the world, stayed curiously silent about the young girls of Khammam. That is, except for one article, published in October 2013, about six weeks after the release of the standing committee\u2019s report.\n\nThe article was written not by one of the girls or one of their parents, not by one of the women from Sama who had advocated on the girls\u2019 behalf, not even by one of the Indian parliamentarians who had been charged with investigating the affair.\n\nNo. It was written by an American man called Seth Berkely. Berkely is the CEO of Gavi, another BMGF funded health behemoth.\n\nBerkely used his forum in The Guardian to claim that the girls who had died after being vaccinated in Khammam had committed suicide. Speaking about the 14,000 subjects involved in the trials, he said, \u201cit would have been unusual if none of them went on to kill themselves.\u201d\n\nCompassion wasn\u2019t the only element missing from his article. Not once did Berkley address the multiple breaches of law and ethics which had occurred or the role of PATH and that of his employers, the Gates Foundation, in his dismissal of this iniquity.\n\nThe Guardian began receiving funding from BMGF in August 2010. Prior to that arrangement, in 2007, the newspaper had published two separate articles which were critical of the lobbying tactics used by Merck to promote Gardasil and which questioned the efficacy of its use in mass vaccination programs.\n\nSubsequent to their arrangement with Gates, all coverage by the Guardian of this drug (and of HPV vaccination in general) has been positive.\n\nThe Indian government was reluctant to take any of the measures recommended by the committee. After all, there were huge amounts of money being made available to the state, institutions and individuals from organisations like PATH.\n\nSo no official reports of human rights violations were ever made by the Indian government to the WHO, to Unicef or to the American government, as had been recommended by the standing committee.\n\nHowever, in 2017, it announced it would no longer accept grants from BMGF for its Immunisation Technical Support Unit, an organisation which provides \u201cvaccination strategy advice\u201d in relation to an estimated 27 million infants. Nevertheless, the Indian government continues to accept the foundation\u2019s grants in other areas.\n\nMerck, and their HPV vaccine Gardasil, have done very well since the dismal events recounted in this article. The Khammam scandal never really affected the company, due to a lack of awareness about it outside India. In 2018 alone, Gardasil sales amounted to more than $3bn, thanks to its inclusion on immunisation schedules around the world, and its launch that year in China.\n\nPATH has never been better. Just like Merck, the lack of reporting about what happened in Khammam meant the organisation didn\u2019t suffer. Since 2010, it has continued to receive huge funding from BMGF and, to a lesser extent, the US Government. During this period, BMGF has provided PATH with more than $1.2bn in funding.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has continued expanding its web of influence. Describing the organisation\u2019s practices around the time of the events outlined here, Jacob Levich said:\n\nThe foundation has since moved on to even more lucrative pastures. The Covid-19 pandemic has really pushed BMGF to centre stage. Gates himself has seen his public profile and political influence grow to an extent that would have been unimaginable even in 2019.\n\nDespite his lack of either scientific qualifications or an electoral mandate, he regularly presses the need for mass global vaccination with products made by the companies he owns, using platforms given to him by the media outlets he funds.\n\nAnd the girls of Khammam?\n\nWell, those poor children and their plight wasn\u2019t even widely known outside of India back in 2010. To say they had been forgotten would be to imply that anybody knew about them or cared about them in the first place.\n\nBernard Marx is the pseudonym used by a writer and teacher based in Ireland.
