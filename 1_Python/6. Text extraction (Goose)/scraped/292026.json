It compared 46,035 Maccabi members who caught the coronavirus at some point during the pandemic and the same number of double-vaccinated people.\n\nPeople who had two vaccine shots had a six-fold higher chance of getting infected with Delta than patients who hadn\u2019t been vaccinated but previously contracted the coronavirus, according to the research. The study, published online but not yet peer reviewed, is the largest of its kind. It doesn\u2019t take booster shots \u2014 now widely given in Israel \u2014 into account, but given that most of the world is still giving a two-dose regimen, has international relevance.\n\nBut experts are stressing that the results shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as discouragement from vaccinating. Immunologist Prof. Cyrille Cohen of Bar Ilan University, who was not involved in the study, told The Times of Israel: \u201cCertain people who are not inclined to get vaccinated might be mistaken and think that this means you\u2019d better get sick a priori and not get a vaccine. Such a thinking is medically wrong, and the results of the study do not mean that people should expose themselves on purpose and get sick.\n\n\u201cAs with other disease, it is much safer to get the vaccine and prevent COVID-19, a disease that puts one at risk of hospitalization, death and long-running after-effects.\u201d\n\nIn the two groups, there were 748 cases of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections, 640 of which were in the vaccinated group and 108 in the previously infected group, which was relying on natural immunity alone. The vaccine-dependent people had a seven-fold higher chance of symptomatic infection, and a 6.7-fold higher chance of being hospitalized.\n\nIn addition, a sample of 16,215 who were infected during Israel\u2019s third wave in January-February 2021 was compared to an equal number of people vaccinated during that period. The contrast for these two groups was even starker: It showed that Delta had a 27-fold higher chance of breaking through vaccine protection from January and February and causing symptoms than breaking through natural immunity acquired in the same period and causing symptoms.\n\nThe study also found that when recovered patients boosted their natural protection with a single vaccine shot \u2014 as recommended by Israeli health officials \u2014 their protection reached new highs, and they had approximately half the infection risk of other recovered patients. \u201cIndividuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant,\u201d the study suggested. \u201cThe long-term protection provided by a third dose, recently administered in Israel, is still unknown.\u201d\n\nThe authors, led by Dr. Sivan Gazit, deputy head of Maccabi\u2019s research arm, noted that their study is significant for taking a wide time-frame and using a large data sample. They wrote: \u201cOur large cohort, enabled by Israel\u2019s rapid rollout of the mass-vaccination campaign, allowed us to investigate the risk for additional infection \u2014 either a breakthrough infection in vaccinated individuals or reinfection in previously infected ones \u2014 over a longer period than thus far described.\u201d\n\nCohen said of the study: \u201cThe data presented is important and can draw a kind of immune hierarchy. From the most protected to the less, there are vaccinated convalescent, convalescent, then vaccinated and then people who choose not to vaccinate, who are the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these \u201cexperts\u201d are telling us to ignore the obvious conclusions from this study and still go out and dutifully get vaccinated even though the unvaccinated with natural immunity are far more likely to fight \u2014 and survive the \u201cvirus\u201d.\n\nWe reported on a study over a year ago that concluded everyone who had been exposed to coronavirus has developed long-term T-cell immunity \u2014 and that basically means everybody.\n\nInstead of testing everyone for \u201cCOVID-19\u201d using their bogus PCR \u201ctests,\u201d they should be testing everyone for natural immunity to coronavirus, but they won\u2019t do that because it would show too many people already have natural immunity and who therefore wouldn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d their bogus \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 vaccines.\n\nCoronavirus is one of the most common viruses in the world \u2014 everybody has been exposed to it \u2014 which is good for them \u2014 and that\u2019s why everybody has some level of long-term natural immunity to it.\n\nOnly immuno-compromised people \u2014 in their 80s who have already exceeded the average life expectancy \u2014 with multiple co-morbidities are the people who \u201cdie of\u201d \u2014 or better yet \u201cdie with\u201d \u2014 coronavirus.\n\nIn other words, ironically, the people who \u201cdie of\u201d coronavirus actually live longer than people who die without it.\n\nAnd it is very common for people with advanced cancers and heart disease to ultimately die of pneumonia or the \u201cflu\u201d \u2014 which is why doctors used to call pneumonia \u201cthe old man\u2019s friend\u201d \u2014 because it put them out of their misery at the end.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why since the advent of the \u201ccoronavirus pandemic\u201d health authorities stopped tracking pneumonia and the seasonal flu \u2014 those people had the symptoms of \u201cCOVID\u201d so they magically became COVID patients.\n\nBut it is very misleading for authors of this new study to claim that people with natural immunity who were given the vaccine \u201cboosted their natural protection with a single shot\u201d \u2014 vaccines do not boost natural immunity \u2014 they boost artificially-induced, short-term immunity that rapidly fades, as many studies on this vaccine show.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t tell you is how long this artificial \u201cboost\u201d of immunity lasts \u2014 when naturally immune people are given the vaccine \u2014 but given how short this artificially-induced immunity has lasted, we would assume it doesn\u2019t last very long at all \u2014 and therefore it\u2019s disingenuous to push the vaccine on anyone who already has long-term natural immunity.\n\nEven the inventor of mRNA \u201cgene therapy\u201d vaccines, Dr. Robert Malone, confirmed that natural immunity to the coronavirus is 20 times more protective than the artificial immunity induced by COVID vaccines.\n\nIn fact, it is medically reckless to do so \u2014 you are medicating people unnecessarily and exposing them to serious vaccine side effects \u2014 like death and permanent disabilities, which include progressive heart failure and delayed strokes.\n\nIf unvaccinated people with natural immunity are 27 times less likely to contract symptoms \u2014 and presumably \u201cspread\u201d the \u201cvirus\u201d \u2014 why vaccinate them at all \u2014 when it is vaccinated people are clearly the vast majority of people getting sick?\n\nAnd these \u201cbooster\u201d shots won\u2019t last any longer than the \u201cstandard\u201d COVID vaccines \u2014 like many cars, all these vaccines have \u201cbuilt-in obsolescence\u201d \u2014 which guarantees customers for life\u2026\n\nAnd a way to cull the herd with \u2018plausible deniability\u2018 whenever it gets either too big or too unruly.\n\u2022 Ghana Becomes first Country in Africa that Approves Oxford's new Malaria Vaccine\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDid you like this information?
