Truncale\u2019s Beaumont, Texas, courtroom on March 1, 2023, to hear Pfizer\u2019s motion to dismiss the False Claims Act case Jackson filed against the pharmaceutical giant on behalf of the United States. Depending on Truncale\u2019s ruling, the case could further expose the enormous fraud and deception between Pfizer and the U.S. government as the billionaire company cut corners and wasted taxpayer money to get its experimental COVID-19 gene therapy jabs into the arms of society. While the world awaits Truncale\u2019s ruling on whether the case will move forward with discovery or be dismissed altogether, as Pfizer hopes, Jackson\u2019s attorney Robert Barnes summed up what is undoubtedly the belief held by any American paying attention, tweeting:\n\n\u201cPfizer promised to deliver a safe, effective vaccine for prevention of COVID based on honest clinical data. Instead, they delivered a dangerous, ineffective gene therapy, preventing nothing. Pfizer lied. People died. Time for discovery.\u201d\n\nJudge Truncale, appointed in 2019, allowed nearly four hours of oral arguments last Wednesday in the case, which centers around revelations of shoddy practices at Ventavia, a contract research company hired to carry out Pfizer\u2019s pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial before the FDA\u2019s issued its Emergency Use Authorization. Truncale noted that he would not issue a ruling from the bench. As of March 6, a decision has yet to be handed down, and according to Barnes, Truncale\u2019s written opinion could take weeks or even months, depending on how long it takes the court to review the case. Barnes explained that the court expressed concern that the net effect of Pfizer\u2019s argument could be \u201cthat there\u2019s no role for the judiciary in overseeing what takes place if the FDA simply continues along with the Pfizer fraud.\u201d\n\nTrying to shift responsibility for any wrongdoing, Defense attorneys argued that even if protocol violations occurred, the case should not move forward because the federal government was aware \u201cbut still granted emergency authorization to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\u201d Racing to beat Moderna as the first pharmaceutical company to unveil an EUA mRNA injection, the billion-dollar company\u2019s attorneys tried to minimize the magnitude of Jackson\u2019s complaints, asserting that \u201ceven if rules were violated, the problems only affected a small number of trial sites.\u201d Astounded by Pfizer\u2019s defense, Barnes explained the company\u2019s extraordinary arrogance and untouchable attitude\u2014remember, they have special immunity thanks to the PREP Act\u2014sharing with Owen Shroyer:\n\n\u201cPfizer\u2019s defense was not that these allegations are false. They challenge whether the allegations are true, but at this stage of the pleadings, they have to assume them to be true legally. Their argument was solely that even if they created a dangerous, ineffective drug that they disguised as a vaccine that they said would be for the prevention of COVID-19, that didn\u2019t prevent COVID at all\u2014in fact, in some cases, it appears the infection rate goes up with COVID depending on how many booster shots that you\u2019ve had\u2014that none of that matters. They argue that as long as the Biden administration, the Justice Department, the FDA, and the Department of Defense go along with this scam, nobody can ever hold them accountable.\n\nThe only way to hold them accountable is the Brook Jackson suit.\u201d\n\nJackson, who has dedicated nearly twenty years to helping get safe and effective therapeutics, vaccines, and devices to consumers, began working for Ventavia on September 8, 2020. Her primary responsibility was overseeing Pfizer\u2019s Phase 3 COVID-19 mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d trial at several locations in Texas. With no reason to initially doubt anything about Pfizer\u2019s drug product or trial, Jackson took her job seriously and was shocked at the poor laboratory management at Ventavia, which calls itself the largest privately owned research company in Texas. Jackson documented several matters of concern, including needles sticking out of bags and vaccine packaging materials with trial participants\u2019 identification numbers written on them left out in the open, potentially unblinding participants. Moreover, with doctored data throughout the trial, participants with severe adverse reactions were ignored, also against protocol. With the agreement for Pfizer to deliver a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, Barnes highlighted the clinical trial atrocities, explaining:\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be a randomized test. It wasn\u2019t. It was supposed to be a placebo-controlled test. It wasn\u2019t. It was supposed to be a blinded clinical trial. It wasn\u2019t. All the data was doctored, and the data, in many ways, was fabricated or falsified.\u201d\n\nPointing out Pfizer\u2019s incredibly well-constructed deception, Barnes explained that certifications were fraudulent, invoices were bogus, and Pfizer further argued that it didn\u2019t have to comply with the FDA rules, which is untrue and was rightly pointed out by Judge Truncale in Wednesday\u2019s hearing. According to Barnes, Pfizer\u2019s contract clearly states that it must follow FDA rules and regulations throughout the entire process. And most importantly, as previously noted, the contract Pfizer signed with the DoD states at least \u201chalf a dozen times\u201d that Pfizer will deliver \u201ca safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.\u201d A task at which the company failed miserably.\n\nWith mounting evidence underlining the extreme measures Pfizer took to deceive the American people as the Biden administration stood by and watched, Barnes hinted that he thinks the next wave of potential litigation against Pfizer and Moderna will be centered around the fact they lied to their shareholders. Barnes pointed out that just as Pfizer and Moderna lied to the Trump Defense Department by stating they would deliver a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, the pharma giants also told their shareholders the same thing. Yet, the vaccine is neither safe nor effective. According to Barnes, that\u2019s fraud on the market, which is one place Pfizer and Moderna have no immunity. Summarizing how perhaps Pfizer is starting to feel the heat, Barnes explained:\n\n\u201cRight now, they\u2019re begging the court not to allow any discovery to occur in this case. They argue that no court process should be allowed and that no jury should be allowed to hear the case. They made this argument explicitly. In fact, what they said is, \u2018once the FDA says something, judge, you judge, have no more power to say a single thing about this. You, the jury has no more power to say a single thing about this.\u2019 [Which is] directly contrary to the False Claims Act.\n\nAnd the key is if this fraud is exposed, that opens the door for them to be held accountable across the board.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Terrified of Discovery: Massive Implications in Pfizer Whistleblower Case", "description": "As America awaits Judge's ruling in the Jackson case, Pfizer fears Discovery, which would open the door to accountability across the board.", "url": "https://thehighwire.com/editorial/terrified-of-discovery-massive-implications-in-pfizer-whistleblower-case/", "site_name": "The HighWire", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-08T16:45:35+00:00", "image": "https://thehighwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PNG-image.jpeg", "image:width": "1920", "image:height": "1082", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSo if the FDA gets it wrong, they just get it wrong and we live with it?\u201d Judge Truncale asked.<br/><br/>\u201cExactly,\u201d said Pfizer attorney Carlton Wessel.</p>\u2014 Brook Jackson \ud83d\udc9c (@IamBrookJackson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IamBrookJackson/status/1631502414170804226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2023</a></blockquote> \n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/barnes_law?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@barnes_law</a>: Pfizer Screwed Trump Twice, Was Supposed to Deliver Vaccine Before 2020 Election<br/><br/>1. \"First, they deliberately sandbagged Trump by not delivering it prior to the election \u2014 so he got no political credit for it.\"<br/><br/>2. \"And then what they turned around and delivered\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/doIpFLnJwa\">https://t.co/doIpFLnJwa</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/pf7fiLZvvD\">pic.twitter.com/pf7fiLZvvD</a></p>\u2014 The Vigilant Fox \ud83e\udd8a (@VigilantFox) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VigilantFox/status/1632894949636157443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2023</a></blockquote> \n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brook Jackson\u2019s court hearing just wrapped at in Beaumont, TX.
