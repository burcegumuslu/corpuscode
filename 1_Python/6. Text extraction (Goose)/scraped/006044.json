They have done irreparable harm to people but now we are stuck. We must continue to take them until we find a safe way to safely come off the vaccination. \n\n \n\n This will explain the deaths and continue the process. Our supply lines will be cut and our rights will be crippled. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n I'm American and I always hear about how great Canada's health care is. I hear that it is free and world class health care. Way better than America's. And I always read that sure there are long waits sometimes but that is only because the problem isn't too serious. This guy's story is awful. Not only was it months waiting, he couldn't even work because of his symptoms but also it wasn't even free! He had to get a loan from his dad in order to even pay and get a doctor's appointment to begin with. What a system! Guess it's not actually \"free universal health care\". a reply to: fernalley I'm American and I always hear about how great Canada's health care is.

However I have created a range of threads with actual cases of people who have been injured or died by the Covid-19 vaccines of all types and have been verified by coroners and medical examiners. \n\n \n\n From all the information around its seems that the Astrazeneca and J&J vaccines are benign in comparison to the mRNA products and given the recorded and suspected cases of injuries from these products the pro-vaccination crowd or commonly known as vaccine apologists have no arguments in favour of either of them. \n\n \n\n If you take a look at my threads through the posting history you will find all the cases covered so far in which Pfizer and Moderna have a special place. I have even created a thread with title: \n\n Pfizer: Six scandals to remember. \n\n \n\n There are numerous of actual and suspected vaccine injuries online caused or allegedly caused by the mRNA products, with cases ranging from myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis, heart failure, heart attacks, blood clots, autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, strokes, etc. \n\n \n\n If you take a look there are several threads on the pathogenesis of the mRNA 'vaccines' and a major factor as one might suspect is free spike protein that can travel everywhere in the body and affect a range of organs. \n\n \n\n If anything the vaccine apologists are not keen in recognising that the Astrazeneca and J&,J vaccines have been quitely but methodically been withdrawn from most countries that have used them. Especially in the case of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the UK which is the country of origin of the vaccine is no longer using it. Most other countries have dropped the roll out. So not safe and effective. \n\n \n\n Next in line are the mRNA products which have caused and are still causing a range of debilitating conditions and deaths.
