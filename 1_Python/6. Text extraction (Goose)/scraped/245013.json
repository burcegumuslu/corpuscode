Moderna\u2019s new Omicron booster contains Moderna\u2019s original vaccine along with a vaccine candidate that targets the Omicron variant.\n\nThe 50-microgram booster\u2014which is a bivalent booster (meaning, it targets two strains)\u2014generated a stronger antibody response against Omicron than the original Moderna vaccine, the company said in a press release.\n\nThe new Omicron booster will be the company\u2019s \u201clead candidate for a fall 2022 booster,\u201d St\u00e9phane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a statement, adding that the company is submitting preliminary data to regulators \u201cwith the hope that the Omicron-containing bivalent booster will be available in the late summer.\u201d\n\nSubvariants of Omicron\u2014BA.2.12.1, BA.2, and more\u2014are currently responsible for the vast majority of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nBut what does it mean to have an Omicron-specific booster? And is this something we\u2019ll all need to get in the fall? Infectious disease experts weigh in.\n\nWhat is Moderna\u2019s new Omicron booster?\n\nCalled mRNA-1273.214, Moderna\u2019s new Omicron booster specifically targets Omicron strains of COVID-19, along with \u201cthe ancestral strain\u201d of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nThe booster was \u201cwell tolerated\u201d during clinical trials with 437 study participants, Moderna said in the press release, adding that the safety profile and side effects were similar to what people had with the first booster dose. Per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), those included:\n\u2022 Redness and swelling at the injection site\n\nWhy is an Omicron booster needed?\n\nDr. Russo points out that, while COVID-19 vaccines have done a good job of keeping most fully vaccinated people from developing severe COVID-19, being hospitalized with the virus, and dying, they\u2019re still \u201cimperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hope is that, if we have variant-specific vaccines, that will do a better job at infection prevention and perhaps a whiff better at preventing hospitalizations and deaths,\u201d Dr. Russo says.\n\nAmesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees that this is needed. \u201cIf the goal is to optimize the vaccine to best protect against circulating variants, updates seem necessary until a universal coronavirus vaccine is developed,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile it seems surprising that we\u2019d need yet another booster, there is precedence for this, says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \u201cThis is analogous to what we do actively with the influenza vaccine,\u201d he says. \u201cWe update it in order to keep up with the changing influenza viruses.\u201d And, he says, it end up being that people will need to get an annual COVID vaccine or booster, similar to what\u2019s currently done with the flu vaccine.\n\nDr. Schaffner calls the booster \u201cCOVID vaccine 2.0,\u201d adding that he and other infectious disease experts \u201chope that this vaccine will provide even broader protection against COVID going forward.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next with Moderna\u2019s new Omicron booster?\n\nFrom here, it goes off to the FDA and, from there, the CDC. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been authorized yet by the FDA or CDC but we anticipate that Moderna and Pfizer\u2014they\u2019re working on the same thing\u2014will have such a vaccine available this fall,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nAnd yes, that means it will likely be recommended that you get another booster come fall. \u201cIt will be right about the same time we\u2019re getting our annual flu vaccine,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. \u201cIf that becomes the case, it will be an interesting challenge for public health and medical experts to persuade people to roll up both their sleeves this fall.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Russo points out that the success of this booster\u2014if it ends up being authorized for use, as expected\u2014depends on whether the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is still circulating in the fall. \u201cNobody knows where we\u2019ll be at,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to have the booster shot available that will best protect everyone, but there\u2019s been a new variant about every six months.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
