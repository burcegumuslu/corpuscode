By studying the language of the body, we can clearly see what Humanae Vitae calls \"biological laws that apply to the human person\" and conclude that the marital act is intrinsically connected with procreation.\n\nYet the Church accords equal value to the unitive aspect of sexual activity. In fact, in their recent document \"Marriage: Life and Love in the Divine Plan,\" the U.S. bishops explain that these two purposes are inseparably connected. In other words, altering or eliminating one distorts the other. The unitive meaning is distorted if the procreative meaning is rejected because love, by its nature, is life-giving. Thus, contraception actually diminishes conjugal love. Likewise, the procreative meaning is tainted if the unitive is not fully present (i.e., if someone were to view his or her spouse as simply a way to produce offspring, such as with artificial reproduction techniques).\n\nCatholics believe that sexual union is the most intimate and profound way of showing love for another person. It involves a mutual giving and receiving of all of one's self, helping a husband and wife become \"one heart and one soul.\" As fertility is an inherent part of the human person, the church opposes contraception because by thus devaluing fertility, contraception devalues the human person and the marital union. One cannot give oneself totally and completely while withholding one's fertility.\n\nTo be fair to Ms. Gibbs, the early Church Fathers of the Patristic Age did indeed teach that the marital act was solely for procreation and that spouses should intend children when they engaged in intercourse. Even St. Augustine taught that marriage and sexual intercourse were for procreation. However, through the centuries Church teaching and theology have developed. It was St. Alphonsus Liguori in the 18th century who united the two purposes of the marital act and taught that both should exist in the intentional order at least implicitly. This teaching has been upheld ever since, and reaffirmed in documents such as Casti Connubii, Humane Vitae, and Theology of the Body.\n\nSign up for a membership at Couple to Couple League International at www.ccli.org, and receive \"Family Foundations.\"\n\nClasses in Natural Family Planning are taught in 17 locations in the Chicago metro area, including southeast Wisconsin and northeast Indiana.
