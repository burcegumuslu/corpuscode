The sound waves enter from the outer ear and from here pass to the ear canal followed by eardrum. This eardrum vibrates from sound waves. This vibration is then carried forward to three little bones present in the ear known as malleus, incus and stapes. The middle ear bones amplify sound vibrations and help to transmit sound from the middle ear to the inner ear. If the stapes bone gets fixed in its place then it hinders normal transmitting of the sound from middle ear to inner ear leading to hearing loss. It is one of the most common causes of hearing loss that arises among young adults. Homeopathic medicines for otosclerosis are highly effective to manage the associated symptoms and bring about recovery.\n\nThe exact reason behind this condition is still not clearly known. But it is thought to arise when extra bony tissue grows around the bone stapes in the middle ear. This abnormal growth of bone decreases the movement of the stapes. It results in a decrease in the amount of sound that is passed to the cochlea in the inner ear. The abnormal bone grows slowly and eventually it gets fixed in its place.\n\nGenetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in its development. Persons having family history of otosclerosis are at high risk to suffer from the same condition. If we consider age then it mainly tends to affect people between the age of 10 to 40 years. Though both men and women can develop this condition but it has been found that women are at higher risk to get otosclerosis as compared to men. People who have suffered from measles at any time in the past are at risk. Measles can lead to development of this condition is evident from the detection of measles virus in stapes footplates in persons having otosclerosis found in various studies. It has also been found that a reduction in cases of otosclerosis has followed in the population who have been vaccinated against this viral infection supporting role of measles virus in otosclerosis.\n\nPeople who have stress fractures to the bones in the middle ear or have / had some of the autoimmune disorder are at risk to suffer from this condition. It is also known that pregnancy can make this condition worse though it doesn\u2019t cause it. A possibility of low levels of fluoride with the development of otosclerosis is also related. It has been evidenced by the fact of reduction of the number of cases of otosclerosis in the UK after adding fluoride in drinking water on a routine basis. Though this possibility is under controversy.\n\nThe major symptom that a person gets in this condition is hearing loss. Initially there arise difficulty in hearing low \u2013 pitched sounds or there is inability to hear a whisper. This tend to gets worse gradually with passing time. Many people having it often narrate that their hearing ability is somewhat better when they are in environment with lot of noise. Mainly conductive type of hearing loss occurs. In this sound waves are able to reach the eardrum but are not carried properly from bones in the middle ear and hence to the inner ear. Sensorineural hearing loss can also occur but it usually appears late with the progression of the disease. The person having it may speak softly because this condition can make him hear his voice sound very loud. Next symptom that appears along with hearing loss is tinnitus (hearing noises in the ear in the absence of any external sound.) It arises from irritation of the nerve endings in the inner ear. It tend to worsen from exhaustion, fatigue, nervousness and in a quiet environment. The intensity of tinnitus doesn\u2019t depend on the intensity or type of hearing loss. Other symptoms that can arise include dizziness / vertigo (a sensation where a person feels as if he is spinning or surrounding objects are moving) and issues with maintaining normal body balance. In this condition one or both of the ears can be affected.\n\nHomeopathic medicines offer much help to manage its symptoms that includes noises in ear (tinnitus), vertigo (spinning sensation and hearing difficulty.
