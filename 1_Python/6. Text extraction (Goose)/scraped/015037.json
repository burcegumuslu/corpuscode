Action Alerts!\n\n Last month, the Academy, in a report titled \u201cCountering Vaccine Hesitancy,\u201d called for the elimination of all non-medical exemptions to vaccinations, including religious exemptions, on the model of California.\n\n Released alongside this report was another report, also from the AAP, bemoaning the increase in vaccine refusals. The report also endorsed doctors\u2019 \u201cfiring\u201d patients who refuse to follow the government\u2019s precise vaccination schedule, and found the number of physicians who have adopted such a policy to have nearly doubled between 2006 and 2013.\n\n This is a serious threat. When organizations like the American Medical Association (AMA) and the AAP call for the elimination of non-medical exemptions, lawmakers are \u201ccovered\u201d and can do whatever the vaccine company campaign donors tell them to do. We\u2019ve already seen an aggressive attempt in Virginia earlier this year, which was fortunately rebuffed with lots of grassroots help. At least ten other states introduced similar legislation as well.\n\n The AAP does not make it easy to follow its deep ties with the vaccine industry. But some of the facts are available. Corporate members of the AAP\u2019s Friends of Children Fund reads like a Who\u2019s Who of the vaccine business: Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur (the largest company in the world devoted entirely to vaccines), AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Meda Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, and others. In the program for the AAP\u2019s October 2016 conference, more than 300 companies are listed as exhibitors, including familiar names like GlaxoSmithKline, Proctor & Gamble, Gerber, most of the above drug companies, and many more besides.\n\n If that weren\u2019t enough, a news report from 2011 concluded that \u201cthe vaccine industry gives millions to [the AAP] for conferences, grants, medical education classes and even helped build their headquarters. The totals are kept secret, but public documents reveal bits and pieces\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n Those \u201cbits and pieces\u201d include a $342,000 payment from Wyeth, maker of the pneumococcal vaccine, and a $433,000 contribution from Merck the same year the Academy endorsed Merck\u2019s HPV vaccine Gardasil\u2014which went on to earn Merck $1.9 billion in sales last year.\n\n The AAP also receives money from the federal government, which has vested financial interests in selling vaccines. It\u2019s no surprise that taxpayer money is being used to fund an organization calling for complete government control of what goes into our children\u2019s bodies\u2014and no doubt, in time, everyone\u2019s body.\n\n The stench of corruption here is unmistakable. In our view, the AAP is completely compromised by its conflicts of interest and has become a front group for Big Pharma. We do not believe that the drug industry is donating such large sums of money out of the goodness of its heart. Our children are paying the price. Just consider the HPV vaccine. More and more data shows how dangerous this particular vaccine can be\u2014yet HPV vaccine advertising is in high gear.\n\n Many Americans are rightly concerned about the how the payments doctors receive from pharmaceutical companies are influencing the types of medication the doctors prescribe. Yet when the discussion turns to vaccines, few critics acknowledge or seem concerned about the extent to which the vaccine industry influences vaccine defenders like the AAP, the AMA, and \u201cexperts\u201d like Dr. Paul Offit, who famously said that babies could tolerate \u201c10,000 vaccines at once.\u201d Offit happens to hold a patent on a vaccine he developed with Merck, and holds a $1.5 million research chair position at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2014a position funded by Merck.\n\n Given these facts\u2014and, of course, legitimate scientific concerns about the safety of vaccinations, along with questions about why they cannot be made safer\u2014it is imperative that parents\u2019 right to make an informed decision regarding their children\u2019s health is preserved.
