(Related: COVID-19 vaccines are killing shocking numbers of doctors in Canada.)\n\nHis comment predictably received massive backlash. The Alberta New Democratic Party (NDP), the province\u2019s leading left-wing opposition group, called on Premier Jason Kenney to remove Madu from his cabinet.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a new low for this minister,\u201d claimed provincial lawmaker Irfan Sabir, a member of the Alberta NDP. \u201cThese comments are way over the line. They\u2019re disrespectful to many, many Albertans who fell sick, who lost loved ones, who lost jobs and businesses.\u201d\n\nMadu thanked people who stood up to \u201ctyrannical\u201d COVID policies\n\nIn addition to criticizing COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine mandates, Madu also thanked Freedom Convoy protesters and other demonstrators \u201cwho had the courage to mobilize against these tyrannical policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey endured a lot of hate, name-calling, suffered and vilified on behalf of all of us,\u201d wrote Madu. \u201cI thank them!\u201d\n\nThese comments in support of the health freedom protests similarly received strong criticisms. Duane Bratt, a political scientist from Mount Royal University, claimed that Madu\u2019s comments are hypocritical because he served in the cabinet of Kenney, who imposed vaccine mandates and lengthy lockdowns on Albertans.\n\n\u201cDid he support provincial COVID restrictions? Or were provincial COVID restrictions about science and not political control? After all, he was a member of that cabinet. He\u2019s still a member of that cabinet,\u201d said Bratt.\n\nBratt went further to suggest that Madu, who he called a \u201clightning rod\u201d for controversy since his election in 2019, could lose his seat in the next election. He even suggested that Madu could cost the UCP other seats in Edmonton, the major urban center of Alberta and where 27 of the provincial Legislative assembly\u2019s 87 seats are elected. The UCP currently holds seven of the 27 seats in Edmonton.\n\n\u201cHe is not going to win his seat in Edmonton. The UCP is not going to win a seat in Edmonton,\u201d claimed Bratt.\n\nLori Williams, another Mount Royal political scientist, agrees with Bratt. \u201cThis is a very extreme position for Kaycee Madu to be taking and one that could jeopardize the future electoral fortunes of the UCP,\u201d she claimed.\n\nKenney has so far declined to comment on Madu\u2019s criticism of COVID-19 policies and gratitude to health freedom protesters, telling local media that he doesn\u2019t monitor the lawmaker\u2019s Twitter account.\n\n\u201cIf you want to hear Minister Madu\u2019s views, or clarification from him, I suggest you talk to him,\u201d he said.\n\nLearn more about how nations like Canada handled the COVID-19 pandemic at Pandemic.news.\n\nWatch this clip and learn how the leading cause of death in Alberta is listed as \u201cunknown.\u201d\n\nThis is from the Alex Hammer channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nIT\u2019S THE VACCINE: \u201cUnknown causes\u201d are now the leading cause of death in Alberta, Canada.\n\nTop killer in Alberta: Deaths from \u201cill-defined and unknown causes\u201d (aka covid vaccines) are skyrocketing.\n\nANOTHER Canadian doctor, 26, dies from covid injections \u2013 that makes SEVEN in just two weeks.\n\nCanadian legal group blasts Alberta magistrate who ruled that doctors can require COVID vaccination before organ transplants.\n\nCanadian doctors: Government data clearly show spike in COVID cases after vaccinations.", "opengraph": {"title": "Alberta cabinet minister admits COVID-19 policies were about \u201cpolitical control and power\u201d and not based on science", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2022-09-26-covid-policies-about-control-not-science-based.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "A cabinet minister for the Canadian province of Alberta has admitted that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates were never based on science, but rather were focused on centralizing \u201cpolitical control and power.\u201d \u201cIt was never about science but about political control and power,\u201d tweeted Alberta\u2019s Minister of Labor and Immigration Kelechi [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.treason.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2022/09/covid-lockdown-chains.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "big government", "deception", "honest", "covid-19", "vaccine mandate", "Alberta", "medical martial law", "health freedom", "Kaycee Madu", "Jason Kenney", "politics", "Canada", "Medical Tyranny", "medical fascism", "government control", "vaccines", "traitors", "freedom", "lockdowns"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/alberta-govt-minister-admits-covid-restrictions-were-all-about-political-control-and-power/", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-29-covid-vaccines-killing-doctors-in-canada.html", "https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/alta-minister-thanks-convoys-says-covid-19-restrictions-were-about-political-control-and-power-1.6076854", "https://www.mtroyal.ca/", "https://pandemic.news/", "https://www.brighteon.com/cb0f4af6-ed4e-44db-ae23-05cc3cb1cddc", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/alexhammer", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/alexhammer", "https://vaccines.news/2022-09-02-unknown-causes-leading-cause-of-death-canada.html", "https://vaccinedeaths.com/2022-08-23-top-killer-alberta-deaths-unknown-covid-vaccines.html", "https://vaccines.news/2022-08-17-7th-canadian-doctor-dies-covid-vaccines-2weeks.html", "https://pandemic.news/2022-07-20-jccf-blasts-alberta-magistrate-covid-vaccine-transplants.html", "https://pandemic.news/2021-11-24-data-shows-spike-in-covid-cases-after-vaccinations.html", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/alberta-govt-minister-admits-covid-restrictions-were-all-about-political-control-and-power/", "https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/alta-minister-thanks-convoys-says-covid-19-restrictions-were-about-political-control-and-power-1.6076854", "https://www.brighteon.com/cb0f4af6-ed4e-44db-ae23-05cc3cb1cddc", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftreason%2F2022-09-26-covid-policies-about-control-not-science-based&linkname=Alberta%20cabinet%20minister%20admits%20COVID-19%20policies%20were%20about%20%E2%80%9Cpolitical%20control%20and%20power%E2%80%9D%20and%20not%20based%20on%20science", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
