Their review was published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements.\n\u2022 Despite giving mixed results in clinical trials against osteoarthritis, glucosamine\u2019s ability to prevent joint destruction and inflammation is well-documented in studies involving rodent models of arthritis and spontaneous osteoarthritis.\n\u2022 Research suggests that oral glucosamine\u2019s effect is markedly dose-dependent, likely reflecting a regulation of tissue levels of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.\n\u2022 This regulation, in turn, influences mucopolysaccharide synthesis and the extent of protein O-GlcNAcylation.\n\u2022 The minimal oral dose of glucosamine that works against arthritis elevates plasma glucosamine to the same levels achieved when the standard clinical dose (1.5 grams daily) is administered as a bolus.\n\u2022 The response of plasma glucosamine levels to an increase in glucosamine intake is nearly linear.\n\u2022 Interestingly, every published clinical trial has used the same 1.5 g dose recommended by Rottapharm for its proprietary glucosamine sulfate product decades ago, despite there being no evidence that the dose is optimal with respect to efficacy and side effects.\n\u2022 According to the researchers, if this dose is clinically efficient, then variations in patient populations targeted, the assessment vehicles employed and the potency of glucosamine preparations tested would yield some null results.\n\u2022 They also suspect that failure to employ bolus dosing is a factor in the null results observed in the Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) study and in other trials.\n\nThe researchers believe that clinical studies should instead focus on the dose-dependency of glucosamine\u2019s influence on osteoarthritis to determine its efficacy.\n\nMccarty MF, O\u2019keefe JH, Dinicolantonio JJ.
