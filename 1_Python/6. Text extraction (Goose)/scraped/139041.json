She spends a lot of her time interpreting research\u2014established and emerging. And our wellness routines thank her for this. (Yours will, too. Send us your own questions for Gerda: [email protected].) Dear goop, I want to do everything I can to support my immune system. Are there nutrients and herbs that can support a healthy immune response in a balanced way? \u2014Katie C. Hi, Katie. Great question, because we want a strong, healthy immune response, but we don\u2019t want it to go overboard. We want to support our innate immunity: the physical barriers and white blood cells that are always guarding us. We want to support our acquired immunity: the antibodies and T cells that are generated in response to an infection or a vaccine. And the topic here: We want to support a balanced inflammatory response. In order to do their job, white blood cells become activated, exit blood vessels, and enter tissues. When white blood cells are activated and found in tissues, this is called inflammation. It is a natural part of a healthy immune response. We want just the right amount of inflammation, not too little and not too much. Our bodies up- and downregulate this response as needed by making more or less of the white-blood-cell-activating cytokines. Here are three ways to be supportive. But please note: This information is not intended to treat excessive inflammation or any disease. Always consult your doctor about any medical condition.\n\nTurmeric and ginger are the botanicals most associated with a healthy inflammatory response. Buy fresh turmeric and ginger roots and try this goop recipe for an unusually delicious spiced latte. Or use dried, powdered turmeric root as a spice in savory dishes. It adds a pretty golden color in this goop recipe for turmeric cashews. Turmeric contains many bioactive compounds, and the one we know the most about is curcumin. Curcumin is an antioxidant that has multiple desirable effects on immune activation. In extensive cell culture research and some clinical studies, curcumin has been shown to help reduce the production of cytokines, like TNF-\u03b1 and interleukins. Turmeric and curcumin are available in multiple kinds of supplements, including special curcumin formulations, turmeric extracts, and turmeric root products. Here\u2019s something a little different: a latte mix with turmeric, coconut, ginger, and activating black pepper. Mix the powder with hot oat milk for a delicious golden latte.\n\nProbiotic bacteria, in many cases various species of Lactobacillus, have been shown to reduce levels of CRP (a marker of inflammation), TNF-\u03b1, and interleukins in preclinical research, and even in people. Many different species, strains, and amounts of probiotics have been used in this research, and we aren\u2019t yet sure which formulations are best. Seed makes a probiotic supplement with over 50 billion live cells from twenty-four strains to cover a lot of bases\u2014including benefits for gut immunity, skin, and the cardiovascular system. The probiotics are surrounded by an outer capsule containing prebiotics\u2014food for bacteria\u2014from pomegranate, one of my favorite beneficial plants. If the bacteria share this with my gut cells, so much the better.*", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tips For Healthy Immunity And Inflammation | goop", "description": "Dear goop, I want to do everything I can to support my immune system.
