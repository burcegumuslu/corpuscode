An adverse event caused by any medical intervention just sucks, especially if the direct benefit of such internvetion is propably miniscule in young patients.\n\n \n\n You have to realize that you are an outlier in this case, since close to 100% of vacc-recipients do not encounter any long term side effects after getting the jab. How would I know? Well, I have personally vaccinated myriads of patients in the last year, none of which reported any crazy adverse events besides the usual stuff (pain, fever, headaches..). The hospital I work at is also one of the main centres who work with long covid/vaccine-injury patients. We just dont see our clinic getting overrun by vaccinated zombies. The only unit that struggles is our critical care unit because of the 90% unvaccinated patients that rely on intensive medical procedures to survive. This goes hand in hand with the available data and is consistent with the anecdotal evidence of first line heatlh workers around the globe.\n\n \n\n Every medical intervention is at its core a risk/benefit calculation. Any intervention that is enforced on a global level will reveal even the slightest signal. So far, we have adminstered more than 8 billion doses of the vaccine - so any side effect that can happen will happen. Neither Leo, nor your body or your favorite vaccination-conspiracy can tell how you are gointo react to it beforehand. Its basically Schr\u00f6dingers-vaccination where the subject survives 99,999% of the time. The same goes for the covid-19 disease. You could be a healthy, 20 year old with zero medical conditions and the virus could still fuck up your lungs irreversibly. Its rare, but it happens and I have seen it happening. I have witnessed a healthy 29 year old dying from Covid - unvaccinated. See, there is no certainty in anything - especially when it comes to complex and chaotic systems. Our minds of course, try to to cling onto every piece of illusory certainty there is - and thats where all the anti-vaxx nonsense comes in. All we have is propability and the informed decisions we could base on that proxy.\n\nMyocarditis/Pericarditis is a well known side effect of the mRNA-Vaccines and depending on what statistic you look like, its incidence is about 1 in 10.000-20.000 (with Moderna). Pfizer comes with a significantly lower chance of developing such events. The reason behind that is propably the lower dose of actual mRNA in the drug. Each shot of Pfizer contains 30 micrograms of mRNA, while each one of Moderna contains 100. Moderna comes with a slightly better outcome regarding hospitalization and death. \n\n \n\n I would not recommend any person below the age of 30 to get the Moderna shot. The risk/reward equation is tilted into the wrong direction in my opinion. If you are below 30, have comorbidities or risk factors and the Moderna shot is the only one available - take it. Otherwise, everyone between 15 & 30 should get Pfizer and thats propably better than not getting it at all. Everyone above 30 should get any shot available + boosters, regardless of comorbidities or risk factors. I do not necessarily recommend the vaccination below the age of 15. There is a new preprint regarding Covid-risk in children, which is pretty clear on that issue IMO: 38669115 (medrxiv.org)\n\nIts not true that Sweden banned mRNA-Vaccines in general, they stopped vaccinating the young (<30) with Moderna and thats a completely rational decision (as mentioned above). Pfizer (which is a mRNA vacc. as well) is still the go-to option for everyone. As you can see, there are systems in place that look at global events regarding vaccination and their adverse effects. We saw the smoking pistol in the vector-based agents (Astrazeneca, J&J..) with the thrombogenic effects and we did see it again with in Moderna. Suppressing such data on a worldwide scale is impossible. \n\n \n\n Regarding your pericarditis: Most cases will heal out without any lasting damage to your heart. I dont know your specific condition but you should definitely talk to a local cardiologist about that. I cant raelly help you with the prognosis because I would need to take a look at your test-results. Is there scar tissue in the pericard? Is there a reduced ventricular output etc. There are alternative methods of dealing with this issue but I would wait and trust your local healthcare provider for now. Thats the only rational thing you can do at the moment. As I mentioned, most cases go back to normal, it just takes time. Any premature alternative treatment over the internet is highly amoral and could make matters worse. \n\n \n\n PS:\n\n The Pfizer vaccine seems to come with a high tolerability, even in elite athletes. 2 days ago, The Lancet published a decent paper about this issue:\n\n Tolerability and impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in elite athletes - The Lancet Respiratory Medicine", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Got pericarditis from second Moderna vaccine, encouraged by Leo", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/75455-got-pericarditis-from-second-moderna-vaccine-encouraged-by-leo/", "description": "\n\n\tOk, so I was very hesitant of taking Covid vaccine since I am very young and athletic and have very strong immune system.
