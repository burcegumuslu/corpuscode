Business entities face a fine of up to 150,000 rubles (over $5,300).\n\nPresident Putin said in 2014 that Russia must protect its citizens from overconsumption of products containing genetically modified organisms. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev followed this with a statement that Russia has no intention to import GMOs, however there are still large quantities of GMO foods being imported in to Russia.\n\nRussian Minister of Agriculture Nikolai Fyodorov believes that Russia must remain a GMO-free country. At a meeting of deputies representing rural areas organized by United Russia, he said that the government will not \u201cpoison their citizens.\u201d\n\nIn February, a group of senators from Russia\u2019s Federation Council introduced a bill seeking to prohibit the distribution and import of products containing GMOs in Russia.\n\nAccording to the explanatory note attached to the bill, only 18 lines of GMOs are officially allowed in Russia at the moment. This is a far lower number than in other countries, as the Russian farming industry has long maintained extensive restrictions on the use of technology related to GMOs. The senators say that because of its WTO membership, Russian markets could import numerous genetically modified products from other countries, thereby destabilizing the situation.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Russian President Putin Signs GMO Labeling Liability Law", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the Russian Federation Code of Administrative Offences into law, including a new article establishing", "url": "https://sustainablepulse.com/2015/01/03/russian-president-putin-signs-gmo-labeling-liability-law/", "site_name": "Sustainable Pulse", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/SustainablePulse/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/SustainablePulse/", "article:published_time": "2015-01-03T12:17:31+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2015-01-04T16:42:42+00:00", "image": "https://sustainablepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Putin.jpg", "image:width": "2000", "image:height": "1258"}, "tags": ["Federation Council", "WTO", "United Russia", "genetically modified organisms", "products", "President Putin", "TASS"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://kremlin.ru/acts/47418", "http://tass.ru/obschestvo/1672064", "https://sustainablepulse.com/2014/03/28/vladimir-putin-russia-must-protect-citizens-gmos/", "https://sustainablepulse.com/2014/05/15/russian-lawmakers-want-impose-criminal-liability-gmo-related-activities/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015-01-03T12:17:31+00:00"}
