The social media platform was merely the go-between, functioning as a snitch-and-delete service for other powerful entities to use in their efforts to silence online free speech.\n\nA coalition of machine learning (i.e., artificial intelligence), internal human review, and outside \u201cpartnerships\u201d allowed for the detection of \u201cmisinformation\u201d on the site, which Twitter promptly deleted whenever it was notified about an \u201coffensive\u201d account or tweet.\n\nTaibbi is the one who came up with the term Censorship-Industrial Complex, to describe this censorship monster, which also included a working group comprised of the following \u201cdisinformation\u201d non-governmental organizations (NGOs):\n\nFirst Draft\n\n Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA)\n\n Alliance for Security Democracy (ASD)\n\n International Republican Institute (IRI)\n\n Atlantic Council / DRFLab\n\n Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO)\n\n Brookings\n\n National Endowment for Democracy (NED)\n\n National Democratic Institute (NDI)\n\nAs you might expect, a lot of money exchanged hands within this massive censorship system. Both the public and the private sector were involved, and figuring out which was which is difficult in that the relationships among them were incestuous and indicative of a revolving door between the government and private industry.\n\nConcerning Newmark, his largest donation to the Censorship-Industrial Complex went specifically to the Stanford Internet Observatory, to which he sent $5 million in funding back in 2019.\n\n\u201cAs it turns out, Newmark is not only quietly shaping the future of American journalism and politics, but he is spearheading government-NGO censorship and the misinformation industry with a win-at-all-costs mentality,\u201d Lenihan says.\n\n\u201cThe Censorship-Industrial Complex represents the greatest threat to free speech online in living memory, and Craig Newmark is bankrolling it.\u201d\n\nMore related news coverage about the scourge of censorship can be found at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Craig Newmark of Craigslist helped fund Censorship-Industrial Complex", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2023-03-28-craigslist-helped-fund-censorship-industrial-complex.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "To help Democrats win more elections, Craig Newmark, the billionaire founder of Craigslist, has been funneling cash straight into what has come to be known as the Censorship-Industrial Complex, a public-private partnership between Big Tech and Big Government to stamp out the First Amendment online.
