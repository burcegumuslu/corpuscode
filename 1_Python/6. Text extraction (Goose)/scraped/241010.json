The results found that 346 of the cases were among vaccinated residents with 79% of them presenting with alleged Covid-19 symptoms, and 1.2% being hospitalised.\n\nHowever the remaining 123 cases were among the unvaccinated population with just 1 person being hospitalised (0.8%. No deaths occurred in either group. The study also found that viral loads were found to be very similar among the vaccinated and unvaccinated, meaning they were equally infectious.\n\nThe Oxford University study examined 900 hospital staff members in Vietnam who had been vaccinated with the Oxford / AstraZeneca viral vector injection between March and April 2021. The entire hospital staff tested negative for the Covid-19 virus in mid May 2021 however, the first case among the vaccinated staff members was discovered on June 11th.\n\nAll 900 hospital staff were then retested for the Covid-19 virus and 52 additional cases were identified immediately, forcing the hospital into lockdown. Over the next two weeks, 16 additional cases were identified.\n\nThe study found that 76% of the Covid-19 positive staff developed respiratory symptoms, with 3 staff members developing pneumonia and one staff member requiring three days of oxygen therapy. Peak viral loads among the fully vaccinated infected group were found to be 251 times higher than peak viral loads found among the staff in March \u2013 April 2020 when they were not vaccinated.\n\nThe UK Department of Health & Social Care study is an analysis of ongoing population wide SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in the UK and includes measures of viral load among the population.\n\nThe study found that viral loads among the vaccinated and unvaccinated population are virtually the same, and much higher than had been recorded prior to the Covid-19 injection roll-out. The study also found that the majority of cases among the vaccinated population were presenting with symptoms when they became positive.\n\nThe authors of the study conclude that the Pfizer and Oxford / AstraZeneca injection have lost efficacy against what they claim to be the Delta Covid-19 variant, but they maintain that they are substantially effective at keeping people from becoming infected with the Delta variant in the rang of 67% to 80%.\n\nNine Pierpoint (MD, PhD) rightly asks in her paper how they can conclude this when 82% of the random sample of new positive PCR tests in the study were fully vaccinated people.\n\n\u2018If a vaccine reduces the risk of becoming infected by two-thirds (67%), we would expect the proportion of vaccinated in the positive sample to be less than the proportion of vaccinated in the population.\n\n\n\nSay we start with 1000 people in the country, of whom we will randomly sample 100. The country is 80% vaccinated. This means that in our sample of 100 we have 80 vaccinated and 20 unvaccinated people.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s say that the virus has infected 10% of the people across the sampling period, or 10 total cases. If 8 of the infected are among the vaccinated, and 2 in the unvaccinated (80% and 20% of the positives, matching the ratio of vaccinated and unvaccinated in the population), the vaccine has made no difference in whether one can get infected (0% efficacy). If the vaccine is 67% effective, the cases in the vaccinated group would be reduced by 2/3 to 2.67 cases, and the total cases would be only 4.67 cases (2.67 vaccinated and 2 unvaccinated).\n\n\n\nThis means that only 2.67/4.67 or 57% of the cases would be in the vaccinated group, and 43% in the unvaccinated. (We can go back to 10% overall being positive just using ratios, yielding 5.7 cases among the vaccinated and 4.3 among the unvaccinated.)\n\n\n\nThis is why the proportion vaccinated in the infected sample, very close to the proportions vaccinated in the total population, are incompatible with the efficacy numbers generated by the authors.\n\n\n\nIt appears to me\u2014as in the Massachusetts study\u2014that the vaccine is not decreasing susceptibility to infection at all, and is in reality somewhere between slightly (insignificantly) decreasing susceptibility and slightly increasing susceptibility to the Delta variant.\n\n\n\nThe UK study is clear that viral load (and thus infectiousness to others) is much greater with Delta than with Alpha, and that, with Delta, viral load and infectiousness are equal in vaccinated and unvaccinated infected people.\u2019\n\nThe above three studies lead Nina Pierpoint (MD, PhD) to conclude in her paper that mandating others to take a vaccine is a potentially harmful, damaging act.\n\nShe writes that since the principal reason of a mandate is to protect others from infection, and these studies prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they do not do this, those who mandate the Covid-19 injections may wish to seek legal councel regarding their culpability and liability for potential long-lasting harm to those whom they pressure into vaccination with the threat of exclusion from employment, education or society.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://theexpose.uk/2021/09/12/three-studies-find-the-covid-19-vaccines-do-not-work/", "https://ninapierpont.com/", "https://theexpose.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pierpont-Why-mandated-vaccines-are-pointless-final-1.pdf", "https://theexpose.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pierpont-Why-mandated-vaccines-are-pointless-final-1.pdf", "https://ninapierpont.com/", "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7031e2-H.pdf", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3897733", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.18.21262237v1", "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7031e2-H.pdf", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3897733", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.18.21262237v1", "https://theexpose.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pierpont-Why-mandated-vaccines-are-pointless-final-1.pdf", "https://theexpose.uk/2021/09/12/three-studies-find-the-covid-19-vaccines-do-not-work/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2020/11/30/voices-against-the-locking-and-isolation-of-people/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/29/the-2020-worldwide-corona-crisis-destroying-civil-society-engineered-economic-depression-global-coup-detat-and-the-great-reset/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2021/01/01/developers-of-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-tied-to-uk-eugenics-movement/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2021/09/15/13-reasons-why-you-should-not-allow-your-child-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2022/02/17/pfizergate-scandal-the-worldwide-cover-up-of-data-to-disguise-the-fact-covid-19-vaccines-cause-vaids/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2020/11/05/what-the-evil-bastards-have-planned-compulsory-vaccination-this-is-the-argument-theyll-use/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2021/01/09/excerpt-from-2009-corbett-report-101-study-finds-link-between-h1n1-and-flu-shots/", "http://philosophers-stone.info/2020/11/30/external-peer-review-of-the-rtpcr-test-to-detect-sars-cov-2-reveals-10-major-scientific-flaws-at-the-molecular-and-methodological-level-consequences-for-false-positive-results/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "12 September 2021"}
