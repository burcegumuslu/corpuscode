However, it wasn\u2019t detected until the 1980s. Research suggests that the virus was likely passed on to humans by chimpanzees when they hunted them for their meat and came in contact with their infected blood.\n\nHIV is a virus that harms the body\u2019s immune system. If not caught and treated swiftly, this virus can lead to a more severe infection known as AIDS. Currently, there is no cure for HIV or AIDS, but this condition can be managed with proper medical care. Living a long, healthy life with this infection is now possible.\n\nWhile this may be true, scientists and doctors always look for ways to cure HIV. And the good news is that they are constantly coming up with new treatments and ideas to treat this condition. If you want to learn more about HIV and what the future of HIV therapy looks like, keep reading below:\n\nIt is thought that approximately 1% of the world\u2019s population is naturally immune to HIV. This is because these individuals have a genetic mutation in one of their genes. People with this mutation lack part of the gene needed to catch HIV, meaning it is impossible for HIV to bind to it.\n\nScientists think that using gene editing and cell line engineering technology. We could edit our DNA and introduce the mutated gene into our bodies to stop HIV and AIDS. This is excellent news for people who are suffering from this condition.\n\nResearch suggests that the main reason HIV is so dangerous is that it attacks the immune system. Once our immune system has been damaged, our body can no longer fight off infections. Immunotherapy can be used to increase the ability of immune cells to fight off these viruses.\n\nSeveral trials are currently ongoing that use immunotherapy as a treatment for AIDS. One example of this is the T and B cell vaccine, which is hoped will help people achieve HIV remission.\n\nAnother approach that has become popular in the fight against HIV is the shock-and-kill tactic. This approach uses agents that activate the dormant HIV in our bodies. Once the virus becomes active, retroviral medication is then used to kill the virus for good. While this approach is still in the pilot stages of development, it is hoped that it will be available soon.\n\nStopping HIV from replicating is another hopeful treatment and cure for HIV. If we block the virus\u2019s ability to replicate its genetic material, it will no longer be able to be passed between humans. This will hopefully eradicate the disease completely.\n\nWe have already seen this approach used on other viruses, including the herpes virus. And while it doesn\u2019t completely get rid of the virus, it does help stop its spread.\n\nHIV has been around for hundreds of years now. While this condition is still not curable, we had come a long way from where we were when it was first detected in humans. No longer is HIV a death sentence. Instead, it can be managed so people can live long, healthy lives. And in the future, we expect to see even more treatments becoming available for people living with HIV.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "What Does the Future of HIV Therapy Look Like?", "description": "If you want to learn more about HIV and what the future of HIV therapy looks like, keep reading below.", "url": "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/everyday-solutions/what-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like/", "site_name": "Health and Natural Healing Tips", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HerbalGuide/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/HerbalGuide/", "article:published_time": "2022-12-14T15:47:50+00:00", "image": "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hiv.png", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/everyday-solutions/what-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like/", "#", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/category/everyday-solutions/", "https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/history-of-aids", "#", "#1_Gene_Editing", "#2_Immunotherapy", "#3_Shock_and_Kill", "#4_Stopping_the_Virus_from_Replicating", "https://www.herabiolabs.com/cell-line-engineering/", "https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-does-the-immune-system-work-3232652", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/category/aids/", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/aids/alternative-therapies-for-hiv/", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/everyday-solutions/what-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like/?share=twitter", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/everyday-solutions/what-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like/?share=facebook", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/everyday-solutions/what-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like/", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/everyday-solutions/what-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like/", "https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthecompleteherbalguide.com%2Fentries%2Feveryday-solutions%2Fwhat-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like%2F&title=What%20Does%20the%20Future%20of%20HIV%20Therapy%20Look%20Like%3F", "https://thecompleteherbalguide.com/entries/everyday-solutions/what-does-the-future-of-hiv-therapy-look-like/"], "authors": ["staceyadmin"], "publish_date": "2022-12-14T15:47:50+00:00"}
