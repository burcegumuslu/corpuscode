Shapiro went as far as calling vaccine skeptics \u201cdopes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is 95% effective in preventing you from getting the virus, and also mitigates the severity of the disease\u2026In other words, get the vaccine, dopes,\u201d Shapiro posted to his four million Twitter followers in December 2020.\n\nDespite vouching for the vaccine for 12 months, the double-vaxxed Shapiro said on Tuesday, \u201cIt is now perfectly clear that we were lied to. And we were lied to at a very high level and from very, very early on by both the vaccine companies, in terms of the ability of the vaccine to prevent transmission, and \u2026 by our politicians who apparently knew better.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ben Shapiro Cancels Candace Owens, Artist Formerly Known As Kanye West\n\nShapiro went on to slam experts who \u201clied\u201d about the vaccine, even though he joined in on vaccine support for months.\n\nThe controversial rightwing podcaster\u2019s recent statement comes after a Pfizer executive made headlines earlier this month when she admitted the pharmaceutical company was not confident the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine would truly prevent transmission of the virus.\n\nOn October 10th, Janine Small, the president of international development markets at Pfizer, was asked if Pfizer was positive the vaccine would prevent transmission.\n\n\u201cRegarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market? No,\u201d Small answered.\n\n\u201cThese, um, you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market. And from that point of view, we had to do everything at risk,\u201d Small continued, admitting the company rushed out a vaccine that may not have been effective.\n\nStay tuned to National File for any updates.\n\nRELATED: New Research Reveals Trace Amounts Of COVID Vaccine Found In Breast Milk Despite Reuters Claiming Otherwise in July, 2021", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ben Shapiro Changes Tune On Vaccine Despite Calling Vaccine Skeptics 'Dopes'", "description": "Shapiro criticized experts who \"lied\" about the vaccine, even though his massive media outlet joined in on vaccine support for months.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/ben-shapiro-changes-tune-on-vaccine-despite-calling-vaccine-skeptics-dopes/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-10-26T19:38:46+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/27365343743_c9e48e9b0d_b.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID-19", "Pfizer", "Ben Shapiro", "Daily Wire", "Vaccine"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In other words, get the vaccine, dopes.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1336340877585707009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pfizer has now admitted they did not test whether the COVID vaccines prevented transmission before releasing them.
