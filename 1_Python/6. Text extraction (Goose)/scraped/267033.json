The National Health Service (NHS) confirmed the move Dec. 9 after two healthcare workers suffered allergic reactions, following their immunization with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on the first day of its distribution the day before. Pfizer\u2019s BNT162b2 vaccine made in partnership with German company BioNTech was the first jab against the Wuhan coronavirus approved in the country.\n\nIn line with the adverse reactions, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued \u201cprecautionary advice\u201d discouraging people who have a \u201chistory of significant reaction\u201d to medicines, foods or vaccines from taking the COVID-19 vaccine. An earlier NHS safety warning advised pregnant and lactating women to avoid the vaccine as its effects on fertility are \u201cunknown.\u201d\n\nThe new NHS advice stated: \u201cResuscitation facilities should be available at all times for all vaccinations. Vaccination should only be carried out in facilities where resuscitation measures are available. NHS England and NHS Improvement spokesman Matthew Edwards told Breitbart London Dec. 8 that \u201cvaccination hubs all follow the guidelines set by the MHRA.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the MHRA did not respond to Breitbart London\u2018s request for comment by the time of publication.\n\nThe new rules followed two healthcare workers who received the vaccine experiencing anaphylactic reactions; both recovered after receiving medical treatment. Incidentally, the health workers carried adrenaline autoinjectors to deal with their allergies.\n\nBased on Johns Hopkins University data, the U.K. currently has a 1.7 million COVID-19 caseload with 3,786 recoveries and 63,179 deaths.\n\nProfessors have said that allergic reactions are common with vaccines such as BNT162b2\n\nThe NHS describes anaphylaxis as a \u201csevere and potentially life-threatening reaction to a trigger such as an allergy\u201d caused by certain foods, medicines and chemicals.\n\nPharmacoepidemiology professor Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said allergic reactions are not unexpected as they occur \u201cwith quite a number of vaccines, and perhaps even more frequently with drugs.\u201d The professor continued that hypersensitivity to the vaccine itself or its ingredients is a valid reason to avoid the jab, but some people would not know if they are hypersensitive to some of the vaccine\u2019s ingredients.\n\nThus, Evans advised those who have a history of allergies and those who need to carry an autoinjector to put off taking the vaccine \u201cuntil the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified.\u201d\n\nImperial College London experimental medicine professor Peter Openshaw said: \u201cAs with all food and medications, there is a very small chance of an allergic reaction to any vaccine. However, it is important that we put this risk in perspective.\u201d (Related: Pfizer boss warns against fast-tracking vaccines.)\n\nOpenshaw continued that the MHRA is monitoring the new COVID-19 vaccine and will perform an investigation to understand if the allergic reactions experienced by the two healthcare workers were linked to the vaccine or were incidental. He commented: \u201cThe fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Pfizer: Other coronavirus vaccine candidates have caused adverse reactions\n\nPrior to the U.K. approving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, some volunteers who participated in COVID-19 vaccine trials by other drugmakers experienced adverse reactions.\n\nBritish firm AstraZeneca reported two volunteers experienced spinal inflammation after being injected with its experimental COVID-19 vaccine. The first reaction was documented in July, while another adverse instance was recorded in September. A month later, one Brazilian participant died during phase three trials in the South American nation.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine developed in partnership with the University of Oxford makes use of a harmless adenovirus. This adenovirus \u2013 similar to the one that causes the common cold \u2013 triggers the body to produce antigens that provide immunity to the Wuhan coronavirus. However, further scrutiny found that toxic ingredients in the vaccine candidate such as aborted human fetal tissue had a role in causing the serious reactions in the three victims.\n\nDespite these red flags, the British firm still insisted on publishing that its vaccine candidate demonstrated a 90 percent efficacy rate \u2013 which was caused by a mistakenly administered one-and-a-half doses. (Related: AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine will \u201cnever be licensed in the US,\u201d says analyst.)\n\nStay updated with the latest news about Wuhan coronavirus vaccines at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "UK to deploy \u201cresuscitation facilities\u201d in coronavirus vaccination centers to treat wave of allergic reactions caused by vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.censoredscience.com/2020-12-18-uk-deploy-resuscitation-facilities-coronavirus-vaccination-centers.html", "site_name": "REAL Science News", "description": "The United Kingdom has confirmed that it will deploy \u201cresuscitation facilities\u201d in coronavirus vaccination centers.
