It is possible to bolster your immune system naturally during the time when flu season is in full swing so why would you put yourself in the path of potential health danger?\n\nIf you still need convincing to help you avoid the vaccine, here are 7 critical reasons you should skip the flu shot:\n\nThe Flu vaccines consist of mercury, a substantial metal known to be perilous for human wellbeing. Mercury toxicity can cause memory loss, depression, ADD, oral health problems, digestive imbalances, respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases and many more such serious health ailments.\n\nResearch shows that over-use of the flu-vaccine and drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can actually alter flu viruses and cause them to mutate into a more deadly strain. Couple this with drug resistant strains and you have virtually no benefits with much risk.\n\nA study has shown that those that receive the flu vaccine for 3-5 years were ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nMedical research shows flu shots are associated with an increased risk of vascular inflammation. Symptoms include fever, jaw pain, muscle aches, pain and stiffness in the neck, upper arms, shoulder and hips and headache.\n\nThere have been literally thousands of medical journal articles published that show injecting vaccines can lead to harmful immunological responses and a host of other infections. Moreover, weak immunological responses only decrease a person\u2019s ability to fight the diseases that the vaccine was supposed to protect against in the first place.\n\nNo benefits for infants and children\n\nScientific review of over 50 studies involving 260,000 children ages 6 to 23 months did not uncover any evidence that young children benefit from the flu vaccine. In fact, results showed the flu shot was no more effective than a placebo. Yet, at the same time, research has shown that the injection itself can lead to serious health complications in patients of any age. Problems have included infection, adverse immunological response and even death.\n\nThe flu vaccine has been officially classified as a Class C dry. Category C is for those drugs that have not had enough human or animal studies conducted to establish their safety, OR have shown adverse fetal effects in animals but there is little human data.\n\nSHOULD YOU GET THE FLU SHOT?
