Subscribe to The Defender\u2019s Top News of the Day. It\u2019s free.\n\nMore than two years after Operation Warp Speed began, Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) commissioned John Zogby Strategies to conduct two surveys about attitudes and the overall health of American adults.\n\nThe first survey of 1,038 adults found that 67% of respondents received one or more COVID-19 vaccines, while 33% are unvaccinated. Furthermore, among those vaccinated, 6% received one dose, 28% received two doses, 21% received three doses, and 12% took four or more.\n\nOf those receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, 15% say they\u2019ve been diagnosed by a medical practitioner with a new condition within a matter of weeks to several months after taking the vaccine.\n\nA follow-up question provided a list of medical conditions and asked diagnosed respondents to \u201cselect all that apply.\u201d Among those who were medically diagnosed with a new condition within a matter of weeks to several months after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, the top five cited conditions were:\n\nOverall, 67% reported that getting the vaccine was a good decision, 24% were neutral and 10% regret it.\n\nSurvey participants were then asked if someone they personally know had been medically diagnosed with a new medical condition within the same time frame. Overall, 26% reported yes, while 63% reported no.\n\nIn the second survey of 829 adults ages 18-49 found that 62% of respondents received a COVID-19 vaccine, while 38% are unvaccinated.\n\nAmong those receiving any COVID-19 vaccine, almost one quarter \u2014 22% \u2014 report being medically diagnosed within a matter of weeks to several months after the shot.\n\nThe top five cited new conditions include:\n\nRegarding describing the conditions, 47% report mild, 43% report serious and 10% report severe/still recovering.\n\nDescribing their experience with taking one or more COVID-19 vaccines, 58% report it was a good decision, 28% are neutral and 14% regret it.\n\nFinally, 30% of those ages 18-49 report knowing someone else who has been medically diagnosed within a matter of weeks to several months after taking a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIn other findings, regarding trust in the government to handle future pandemics among the all-adults survey \u2014 23% say it has increased, 34% say it has decreased, 32% say it has remained the same and the rest were unsure.\n\nThe surveys included 1,038 American adults of all ages (MOE +/- 3.1) and 829 18-49-year-olds (MOE +/- 3.5). Both polls were fielded July 22-24, and data sets were pre-stratified and weighted to be representative of their respective populations. Error margins are higher for subgroups.\n\nPublished to The Liberty Beacon from EuropeReloaded.com", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "15% of American Adults Diagnosed With New Condition After COVID Vaccine, Zogby Survey Finds | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "2 surveys by John Zogby Strategies for CHD show that between 15% and 22% of Americans have had a new medical condition diagnosed post Covid vaccination.", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/15-of-american-adults-diagnosed-with-new-condition-after-covid-vaccine-zogby-survey-finds/", "article:published_time": "2022-07-30T06:04:17+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-07-30T06:04:17+00:00"}, "tags": ["Pam Barker", "new medical condition post-vax", "Children\u2019s Health Defense", "COVID vaccines", "Europe Reloaded", "John Zogby Strategies"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/about-us/sign-up/?utm_source=top_of_article&utm_medium=the_defender&utm_campaign=sign_ups", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/", "https://johnzogbystrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/XTABS_ALL-ADULTS-and-COVID-Vaccines-Survey_July-2022.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaccine-injury-cover-up-covid-vaccination/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/deaths-covid-vaccines-cdc-novavax-vaers/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/sandra-jacobs-cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis-johnson-covid-vaccine/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/sharyl-attkisson-steven-gundry-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-heart-attack-risk/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-vaccine-potential-alter-dna-human-liver-cells/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/third-u-s-male-vaccine-induced-blood-clots-johnson-johnson/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/healthy-man-stroke-johnson-johnson-vaccine/", "https://johnzogbystrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/XTABS_18-49-and-COVID-Vaccines-Survey_July-2022.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/american-adults-diagnosed-condition-covid-vaccine-zogby-survey/?utm_source=salsa&eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=ed5206ef-1c2d-4474-8fa3-be08d441b830", "http://www.europereloaded.com/", "http://www.europereloaded.com/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-07-30T06:04:17+00:00"}
