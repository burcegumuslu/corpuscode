Biden started off well enough as he offered that he shared the public\u2019s frustration and loss and commended Americans who have been vaccinated.\n\nThen he turned to vaccination shaming.\n\n\u201cYou have an obligation to yourselves, to your family and, quite frankly \u2014 I know I\u2019ll get criticized for this \u2014 to your country\u201d to get vaccinated, Biden declared.\n\nHe added, \u201cI honest to God believe it\u2019s your patriotic duty.\u201d\n\nCalling the unvaccinated unpatriotic \u2014 that\u2019ll win them over. Too bad Biden didn\u2019t call them stupid, too.\n\nBiden\u2019s remarks were not completely tone-deaf. Aware that red states like Alabama have a much lower rate of vaccination than blue states like California, Biden credited former President Donald Trump for getting vaccinated and a booster shot. \u201cIt may be one of the few things he and I agree on,\u201d the Democrat quipped.\n\nBiden even credited \u201cthe prior administration and our scientific community\u201d for making America one of the earliest countries to develop vaccines.\n\nHe could have done more. There are pockets of the vaccine-resistant who don\u2019t trust the scientific establishment because they\u2019ve seen a tendency to shut down unorthodox opinions.\n\nStanford Medical School epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya tweeted that the Biden address had positives but took issue with Biden \u201cblaming \u2018misinformation\u2019 for vaccine hesitancy without an acknowledgment that the government & some media have caused great harm to trust in science & the vaccines by their propaganda and silencing of scientific dissidents.\u201d\n\nThe American Institute for Economic Research reported that retiring Director of National Institutes of Health Francis Collins asked colleagues to publish \u201ca quick and devastating\u201d takedown of the October 2020 Great Barrington Declaration, which warned of the devastating public-health effects of blanket COVID-19 lockdowns and called for a return to normal.\n\nCollins dismissed the three authors, Bhattacharya, Oxford University epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta and Harvard epidemiologist Martin Kulldorff as \u201cfringe epidemiologists.\u201d\n\nBut they were right, and the numbers suggest that\u2019s exactly what happened. According to The New York Times, 95% of Americans aged 65 and older have had at least one vaccine dose, and 88% are fully vaccinated. So, yaaay.\n\nAnd this Biden statement is just wrong: \u201cAlmost everyone who has died from COVID-19 in the past many months has been unvaccinated.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 16,700 COVID-19 deaths of vaccinated individuals \u2014 compared with nearly 60,000 unvaccinated, from April through November. The CDC now estimates that unvaccinated individuals are 20 times more likely to die than vaccinated people.\n\nAmid mushrooming breakthrough cases, Americans are looking for tests and not finding them on pharmacy shelves. Here, the Biden administration has come up short. The administration promised half a billion tests next month \u2014 too little, too late.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Biden and other Democrats were merciless in their bashing of Trump for being unprepared and not sufficiently forceful in taking on the virus.\n\nTell me how Biden\u2019s better, because I don\u2019t see it. The last year has been a year of drift.\n\nLike Trump, Biden is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for his response to it.\n\n\u201cBlaming people for getting sick is wrong & bad for public health. It will make many vaccine-hesitant individuals distrust the message & further social division,\u201d Bhattacharya warned.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.discovery.org/m/sites/51/2021/05/Biden-with-Mask-On.jpg", "image:width": "560", "image:height": "470", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccine Shaming Is Not a Cure", "description": "Blaming the unvaccinated is the sharpest tool in President Joe Biden's shed, and that is not healthy for America.", "url": "https://www.discovery.org/leadership/blog/vaccine-shaming-is-not-a-cure", "site_name": "Chapman Center for Citizen Leadership", "updated_time": "2022-01-04T20:20+00:00", "article:published_time": "2021-12-26T20:16+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-04T20:20+00:00"}, "tags": ["Democrats", "COVID-19", "Vaccine Mandates", "Biden"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.mgid.com/ghits/11556942/i/123055/0/pp/1/1?h=17RKV9hg0HLIzShy6_vg4qZWhxmUq78JBXRW-WwtJiMjNFn7FozLBOxLskm_CMpq&rid=4c6d24a3-6d9b-11ec-9c64-78ac440ce852&ts=realclearpolitics.com&tt=Referral&att=4&cpm=1&gbpp=1&abd=1&iv=11&ct=1&gdpr=0&muid=k8176_23jbWa"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-12-26T20:16+00:00"}
