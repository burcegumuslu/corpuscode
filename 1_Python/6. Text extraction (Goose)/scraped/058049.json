These tests were taken from 2006 to 2018 to see whether the researchers could find evidence of what is known as the Flynn effect. (Related: Education Department report shows school shutdowns caused HISTORIC learning losses for students nationwide.)\n\nThe Flynn effect is a theory that suggests the IQ of a population generally appears to increase each generation. As the study authors themselves noted, IQ scores have \u201csubstantially increased since 1932 and through the 20th century.\u201d Per decade, average IQ points would increase by three to five points.\n\nThe researchers noted that there have been very few, if any, studies focusing on average IQ in the United States when compared to studies in European countries.\n\nIQ scores declined across the board regardless of age and gender\n\nInstead of proving the validity of the Flynn effect, the researchers found the exact opposite of what they were looking for. Overall, the results suggest that IQ points from 2006 to 2018 have declined.\n\nDeclines were seen widely across the board irrespective of either age or gender, but the steepest decline in IQ was found among people with lower levels of completed education and participants between the ages of 18 and 22.\n\nThe study authors did note that people with higher levels of education, such as four-year degree holders, had less of a decline.\n\nOf the five test categories in the IQ tests the researchers studied, they only saw improvements in one category: 3d spatial reasoning. Scores for the 3d spatial reasoning portion of the tests increased from 2011 to 2018. Other test categories \u2013 verbal reasoning, visual problem solving, inductive reasoning and numerical reasoning \u2013 all dropped.\n\nWhile the researchers didn\u2019t explicitly make any conclusions as to why the IQ of Americans has dropped over the years, they did speculate that it might have to do with changes in education in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt could be the case that our results indicate a change of quality or content of education and test-taking skills within this large United States sample,\u201d the study authors wrote in the conclusion. \u201cAs scores were lower for more recent participants across all levels of education, this might suggest that either the caliber of education has decreased across this study\u2019s sample and/or that there has been a shift in the perceived value of certain cognitive skills.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the latest research in the field of science at Research.news.\n\nWatch this clip from \u201cWar Room: Pandemic\u201d on Real America\u2019s Voice as host Steve Bannon and his guest, Liz Yore, discuss how IQ dropped dramatically during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThis video is from the News Clips channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nPublic schools are collapsing fast as teacher says they are now indoctrination centers, not places of education.\n\nAmerican children are losing millions of IQ points thanks to exposure to toxic chemicals.\n\nBabies born during the pandemic have lower IQs than those born pre-pandemic, studies reveal.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study finds IQ scores in the US have dropped for first time in nearly a century", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2023-03-13-iq-scores-us-dropped-first-time-century.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "New research shows the average intelligence quotient (IQ) of people in the United States has dropped for the first time in nearly 100 years.
