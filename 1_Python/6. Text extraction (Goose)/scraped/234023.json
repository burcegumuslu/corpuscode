Dr. Peter Marks, FDA\u2019s director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research wrote this as justification for the approval to do this in the FDA press release:7\n\n\u201cOur scientific and medical experts conducted an incredibly thorough and thoughtful evaluation of this vaccine. We evaluated scientific data and information included in hundreds of thousands of pages, conducted our own analyses of Comirnaty\u2019s safety and effectiveness, and performed a detailed assessment of the manufacturing processes, including inspections of the manufacturing facilities.\u201d\n\nIt is the FDA\u2019s statutory obligation8 to publish this \u201cincredibly thorough\u201d evaluation of the data and their own analysis within 30 days of a drug approval. Yet, after a Freedom of Information Act request and subsequent lawsuit by a nonprofit group to release the data,9 the FDA proposed to release documentation over many decades.\n\nUltimately, they asked a federal judge to give them 75 years to complete the process,10 but in January 2022 a federal judge ordered the FDA to accelerate this schedule to eight months.11\n\nAccording to Doshi,12 it will take Pfizer at least 24 months after the study completion date listed on ClinicalTrials.gov13 to even consider a request to release the primary data. Doshi calls this an \u201cunacceptable delay,\u201d and yet the lack of access to data is not unique to Pfizer.\n\nModerna and AstraZeneca14 have both indicated they will have similar delays in releasing their data.15 Since only the data from Pfizer can be released by the FDA, it falls to Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca to provide the raw data. Doshi points out that raw data for other therapeutics tied to COVID-19 are also difficult to uncover.\n\nFor example, the published reports of the monoclonal antibody therapy produced by Regeneron state that any raw data will not be released to others.16 Only the methods and findings will be released, and the raw data will only be considered once the drug has been approved and if there\u2019s legal authority to share it.\n\nLikewise, Doshi notes the raw data from the National Institutes of Health for the drug promoted to treat COVID-19 \u2014 remdesivir \u2014 is limited, with the accompanying explanation: \u201cThe longitudinal data set only contains a small subset of the protocol and statistical analysis plan objectives.\u201d17 Doshi argues the point, writing:\n\n\u201cWe are left with publications but no access to the underlying data on reasonable request. This is worrying for trial participants, researchers, clinicians, journal editors, policy makers, and the public. The journals that have published these primary studies may argue that they faced an awkward dilemma, caught between making the summary findings available quickly and upholding the best ethical values that support timely access to underlying data.\n\nIn our view, there is no dilemma; the anonymized individual participant data from clinical trials must be made available for independent scrutiny.\u201d\n\nAccess to the underlying data is necessary for transparent decision-making. Each of these are essential steps for public health safety. Doshi notes18 that had information been revealed as to why the vaccine trials were not used to test efficacy against the infection, countries would have learned earlier about how the vaccine allowed transmission in the pandemic and would have been able to plan public health strategies accordingly.\n\nPfizer has been a habitual offender in shady dealings, having been sued in multiple venues over unethical drug testing, illegal marketing practices,19 bribery in multiple countries,20 environmental violations,21 labor and worker safety violations and more.22,23\n\nDoshi cites documentation24 that three of the companies have had past criminal and civil settlements costing them billions of dollars, one pleaded guilty to fraud and other drug companies have jumped into developing a genetic injection with no track record before the pandemic. These actions create doubt that the raw data will adequately support the manufacturers claims.\n\nLack of Raw Data After Drug Release Reminiscent of Tamiflu\n\nDoshi recalls that 12 years ago the scientific community called for the release of raw data from clinical trials from another drug that was stockpiled by governments around the world in the middle of a different pandemic.25\n\nIn this case, most of the trials that formed the foundation of the government approval and stockpiling of Tamiflu were sponsored by the manufacturer and ghost written by writers paid by the manufacturer. Ironically, those who were listed as principal authors did not have access to the raw data.\n\nThe history of Tamiflu also parallels remdesivir, a drug that has little or no positive effect on treatment of COVID.26 Dr. Tom Jefferson is an epidemiologist who works for the Cochrane Collaboration, an organization that collects and reviews medical research findings.\n\nIn his presentation at the Symposium about Scientific Freedom in Copenhagen,27 Jefferson described the intricate and complex journey he and his team took to publish the only Cochrane review that was based solely on raw unpublished regulatory data for Tamiflu.\n\nUltimately, his review demonstrated that the drug shortened the duration of symptoms from flu by less than one day. However, the struggle to obtain the data was nearly as eye-opening as the results.\n\nIt took four years for Roche to deliver 150,000 pages of clinical data to Jefferson\u2019s team.28 After getting the data, Jefferson found that although the drug was used worldwide, the WHO had never vetted the raw data, nor had the European Medicines Agency, nor had the CDC.\n\nThe FDA had seen the data, however, which prompted them to request a published statement on the label \u201csaying serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or without complications \u2026 but Tamiflu has not been shown to prevent such complications.\u201d29 Jefferson commented: \u201cThe FDA was saying, this business about complications, no evidence of that.\u201d\n\nJefferson also notes that even a decade after the Tamiflu Phase 3 trials were completed, they remained unpublished. From an analysis the team determined \u201cthere was no convincing trial evidence that Tamiflu affected influenza complications and treatment or influenza infections in prophylaxis.\u201d30\n\nAt Least One Pizer Shot Testing Facility Had Poor Practices\n\nPaul Thacker, investigative journalist from the BMJ, reported on evidence presented by researchers in a Texas privately-owned clinical research lab that the data integrity in Pfizer\u2019s vaccine trial was suspect.31 While this should have been front-page news in 2021, the mainstream media completely ignored it.\n\nAccording to Brook Jackson, a veteran clinical research coordinator with 20 years of experience, the Pfizer Phase 3 COVID jab trial included data that were falsified, patients who were unblinded and poorly trained people hired to administer the injections. Additionally, follow up on any adverse side effects reported by the participants lagged significantly.\n\nThacker led the article with the statement: \u201cRevelations of poor practices at a contract research company helping to carry out Pfizer\u2019s pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial raise questions about data integrity and regulatory oversight.\u201d32\n\nJackson attempted to inform her superiors multiple times. When her concerns were ignored, she called the FDA and filed an email complaint. Hours later she was fired after working just two weeks. According to her separation letter the management had decided she was \u201cnot a good fit\u201d for the company. According to Jackson, this was the first time she\u2019d ever been fired in her 20-year career as a clinical research coordinator.\n\nWhile the briefing document that Pfizer submitted to the FDA in the application for an emergency use authorization contained no indication of any problems at the lab, Jackson has since provided The BMJ with \u201cdozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings and emails\u201d33 proving her concerns were valid.\n\nThe BMJ also learned that Jackson\u2019s allegations were supported by others. Months later, Jackson reconnected with employees who were either fired from the lab or who left. One official sent a text message to Jackson saying, \u201ceverything that you complained about was spot on.\u201d34\n\nTwo other former employees spoke to The BMJ anonymously confirming the broad allegations made in Jackson\u2019s complaint, with one person saying she had worked on more than four dozen trials during her career, but had never experienced the type of work environment at Ventavia on the Pfizer trial.\n\nFor example, in several cases there weren\u2019t enough employees to swab the trial participants who were reporting symptom, even though the trial required lab confirmation of symptomatic COVID-19 as a primary endpoint. The employee called the data produced by the Ventavia lab for the Pfizer trial \u201ca crazy mess.\u201d35\n\nDoshi also addressed the need for adequate and controlled studies with long-term follow-up before granting approval for vaccinations, most notably the COVID-19 genetic therapy injection.36 In an opinion piece published August 23, 2021, he discussed the updated results that Pfizer had posted for their ongoing Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial.37\n\nMonths before, the company had announced the vaccine efficacy was estimated to be \u201cup to six months\u201d after injection.38 While updated results were published one year after the trial began,39 there were not 10 months of data in the follow-up. The paper appeared to be based on the same data included in the April 1, 2021, news release from Pfizer.40\n\nThe efficacy results were identical, claiming 91.3% efficacy against symptomatic disease \u201cup to six months of follow-up.\u201d Doshi points out that this matters because it is thus far the most information Pfizer had offered to the public as they were pursuing full approval from the FDA. Both Pfizer41 and the CDC42 have claimed the shot is 95% effective.\n\nWithout addressing whether that 95% is absolute or relative risk reduction, or how Pfizer arrived at those claims, it\u2019s also important to note that little can be said about how long vaccine-induced immunity could last when researchers had only measured two months of data.\n\n\u201cWaning immunity\u201d is a known issue for some vaccines, such as the influenza shot.43 Doshi notes44 there have been some studies that found near zero effectiveness only three months after the flu vaccine was administered. The crucial question is the level of effectiveness of the vaccine after an individual is exposed to the virus.\n\nIn early July 2021, Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health reported that efficacy against asymptomatic disease fell dramatically in the months following vaccinations. Israel exclusively uses the Pfizer vaccine, which Pfizer\u2019s chief scientific officer, Philip Dormitzer, told a Zoom meeting:45\n\nOnly 7% of Trial Participants Reached 6 Months of Data\n\nData released from Israel show the efficacy fell to 64% over one month from June 6, 2021, to July 5, 2021.46 By late July, the efficacy had dropped dramatically again to 39%.47 While these numbers are low, the FDA\u2019s expectation is that any approved vaccine should be at least 50% effective.48\n\nStarting in December 2020, Pfizer unblinded the majority of the participants in the trial and allowed the placebo group to get vaccinated. By March 13, 2021, 93% of those participating in the Pfizer trial had been unblinded. This means the reference to six months of safety and efficacy in the preprint paper reports on only the 7% of trial participants that reached six months of the blinded follow up.\n\nWhile the paper was published one year after the trial began, the data reported do not go past the first six months, which is the time period in which Israel reports efficacy dropped to 39%. Doshi goes on to say:49\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine that the <10% of trial participants who remained blinded at six months (which presumably further dwindled after 13 March 2021) could constitute a reliable or valid sample to produce further findings. And the preprint does not report any demographic comparisons to justify future analyses.\u201d\n\nAlthough claims have been made that the vaccine prevents severe disease, the trials were not designed to study severe disease, which Doshi details in another paper published in The BMJ.50 In the opinion piece published in The BMJ, Doshi writes:51\n\n\u201cBut here we are, with FDA reportedly on the verge of granting a marketing license 13 months into the still ongoing, two-year pivotal trial, with no reported data past 13 March 2021, unclear efficacy after six months due to unblinding, evidence of waning protection irrespective of the Delta variant, and limited reporting of safety data.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, the very day Doshi\u2019s paper was published in The BMJ, the FDA announced approval for the Pfizer COVID-19 shot being marketed as Comirnaty.52\n\nYet, without adequate data analysis, and with mounting numbers of adverse events reported to VAERS,53 the FDA still expanded eligibility for the jab to include children 12 years and older to receive a single booster dose and approved emergency use authorization for children 5 years old and older.54 Doshi ends with a reasoned and logical call to action to the FDA:55\n\n\u201cFDA should be demanding that the companies complete the two-year follow- up, as originally planned (even without a placebo group, much can still be learned about safety). They should demand adequate, controlled studies using patient outcomes in the now substantial population of people who have recovered from covid. And regulators should bolster public trust by helping ensure that everyone can access the underlying data.\u201d\n\n1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, January 21, 2022\n\n2, 12, 15 The BMJ; 2022;376:o102\n\n3 Council on Foreign Relations, December 27, 2021, What are the leading COVID vaccines?\n\n4 Open VAERS, January 14, 2022\n\n5, 7, 52 FDA, August 23, 2021\n\n6 Anthraxvaccine.blogspot.com January 10, 2022\n\n8 SOPP 8401.7: Action Package for Posting December 11, 2020, page 1, III.
