I\u2019m pretty sure Sunday dinner was the only day she drank, and she lived to 90.\n\nI can see now that her weekly drink was related to a scientific process discovered in 1941, called hormesis, translated as \u201cthat which excites.\u201d Akin to philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s adage that \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill me makes me stronger,\u201d hormesis suggests that when you ingest something in a small dose that is otherwise bad for you at a higher dose, your body responds to the stressor with a healing response that is more potent than the ingested toxic substance.1\n\nMy grandmother was right, moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a longer life, especially when it comes to reducing the risk of death from stroke and heart disease. She was supporting the theory of hormesis!1-3 A drink a week may help us stay healthy, while excess alcohol consumption is associated with heart disease, liver cirrhosis, neurological disorders, and cancers. So if a little is good, that does not than more is better!3\n\nAs crazy as it may sound, according to scientific research, even the nicotine in cigarette smoke has a hormetic, or protective, effect against Parkinson\u2019s disease, but is clearly a major health concern in other areas.4\n\nThe theory of hormesis also has its own system of medicine: Homeopathy is a proven medical system that that introduces small amounts of harmful substances into the body to elicit a predictable and reproducible therapeutic effect.\n\nHomeopathy takes many of its cues from examples of hormesis in nature.\n\u2022 Bacteria tend to flourish in the presence of tiny amounts of antibiotics.\n\u2022 Worms that are exposed to environmental stressors, such as heat, hypoxia, and excess free radicals, exhibit longer lifespan.\n\u2022 Insects treated with very small amounts of pesticides live longer and make more eggs.\n\u2022 Humans who experience an ischemic event (stroke) become more resistant to further ischemic events.\n\u2022 Exposure to small amounts of toxins like dioxin enhances an organism\u2019s response to other stressors.\n\u2022 Low-dose radiation has been shown to have a hormetic therapeutic effect.\n\u2022 A small amount of neurotoxin, such as beta amyloid plaque, has been shown to have a protective effect on neurons.\n\u2022 Acquired immunity through vaccinations can also be termed hormesis.\n\nHave We Become Soft as We Become Farther Removed From Nature?\n\nIn a powerful New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study, researchers compared the asthma rates of kids from two genetically-similar farming communities. They compared the kids from an Amish farming community in Indiana to the kids from a Hutterite farming community in South Dakota.8\n\nThe unique difference in these two communities is that the Amish still farm in the traditional way: with horse-drawn carriages, and with kids running barefoot in dusty barns and interacting regularly with livestock. The Hutterite community has modernized their farming methods. Their farms are industrialized, sterile, and the farmers and kids have little access to farm animals.\n\nThe researchers examined 30 kids from each group and found that none of the Amish kids had asthma, while six of the Hutterite kids did. The study concluded that the dust in barns acted as a respiratory irritant that triggered a hormetic effect that made them essentially immune to breathing difficulties like asthma.\n\nIn the U.S., on average, only 10 percent of children are diagnosed with asthma, meaning the Amish kids who run barefoot in barns and have cows as pets are less likely to have asthma than the average American child.8\n\nThe researchers then exposed mice to both Amish and Hutterite dust . The mice that were exposed to the Hutterite dust had breathing troubles and inflamed airways, and the mice that were exposed to the Amish dust did not.8\n\nIn the NEJM study, researchers also found that the Amish kids had far more white blood cells, which are important for fighting infections. And that Amish white blood cells were less reactive than the Hutterite\u2019s, suggesting that hormesis, in this case the regular exposure to allergens, dust, microbes, livestock, and dirt, may be responsible for boosting immunity.\n\nAnother study of more than 10,000 children in 14 countries in Europe, Scandinavia, and Australia compared those who grew up on farms to those who grew up in suburbia or the city. They found that children who grew up on farms were:18\n\u2022 54% less likely to have hay fever\n\u2022 57% less likely to have nasal allergies\n\u2022 50% less likely to have asthma\n\nResearchers found that farm kids were exposed to more dust, mites, and respiratory irritants. Rural kids had more white blood cells (WBCs) than urban kids, suggesting the immune system does indeed respond to stimulation.\n\nMaybe we have become too comfortable. Most of us are intolerant to heat and cold, and unable to digest foods like wheat and dairy. Have we become allergic to our world? One of the best examples of our environmental intolerance is from research done on a Dutchman named Wim Hof, who teaches breathing techniques and cold exposure. Studies on him and others he has taught have found that cold exposure can boost immunity, energy, and stamina. Wim is famous for climbing Mt. Everest in shorts and running a marathon in the Arctic Circle with bare feet. He also holds the world record for the longest ice bath (during which his core temperature actually rose).5,6\n\nHe contends that our ancestors all survived in the cold without heated or air-conditioned caves or tents. They endured long winters and hunted in freezing temperatures that modern humans simply don\u2019t tolerate. Wim Hof is teaching how to re-enliven abilities that we all have by using hormesis\u2014by re-introducing small amounts of cold back into the human physiology.5,6\n\nIn another example of how exposure therapy works, Hormesis suggests that our immune system developed over millions of years from eating hard-to-digest foods that may irritate the intestinal lining. That irritation, from the anti-nutrients that protect the seed, nut, grain, and bean of fruit (such as nightshades and lectins like gluten and phytic acids), provides the gut stimulation we need to build gut immunity, which makes up 70% of the body\u2019s total immune response. Emerging science shows that removing these gut irritants may severely compromise our immune systems.\n\nJust taking wheat, dairy, nuts, seeds, grains, legumes, or fruits out of your diet without addressing the underlying imbalance in digestion that has created the food intolerance is like sweeping the real problem under the rug. The symptoms could return aggressively in the months or years to come.\n\n5 Reasons Gluten is Good For You\n\nWhen you cut wheat out of your diet, you are forgoing gluten, which has been shown to support a healthy microbiome, immunity, and more. Here, five reasons to keep wheat, and gluten, on the menu:\n\nIn one study from the British Medical Journal, or BMJ, 10 healthy 30-year-olds were put on a gluten-free diet for one month. Analysis of their food intake and stool indicated their numbers of healthy gut bacteria decreased. More surprisingly, the numbers of unhealthy bacteria increased.\n\nBased on these findings, researchers concluded that a gluten-free diet, even for just one month, could alter microbes and compromise the immune system.14\n\nIn another study, from the American Heart Association, involving nine healthy individuals, five were given three grams of concentrated wheat gluten per day for six days, and four followed a gluten-free diet. The gluten group saw a significant increase in natural killer cell activity.\n\nThis is significant, as natural killer (NK) cells are our bodies\u2019 frontline defense system. They are incredibly important in individuals with autoimmune conditions and cancer. The group on a gluten-free diet saw no increase in NK cell activity.15\n\nMany studies link a diet rich in whole wheat to lower cholesterol levels. Wheat fiber, specifically, has always been assumed to be responsible for this health benefit.\n\nHowever, in one study, folks who ate a diet high in fiber and gluten saw lower triglyceride levels than the control group, who ate diets high in fiber.16 This suggests that gluten, not wheat fiber, may be the factor responsible for lowering triglyceride levels.\n\nIn one recent study, mercury levels were compared in three groups of people:\n\u2022 Celiac patients who had not yet started a gluten-free diet\n\nThe group of celiac patients that had been on a gluten-free diet had FOUR TIMES the amount of toxic mercury in their blood than the other groups.17\n\nAs we can see, while removing gluten from one\u2019s diet may seem like a healthy idea, there may be unintended consequences. When we take digestive stimulation out of the diet by removing foods that are somewhat harder to digest (not only wheat, but also nuts, seeds, nightshades, goitrogens, oxalates, and more), we may also remove an immune-boosting stimulus that we have developed to benefit from over millions of years.\n\nThe concept is that our overall health and immunity is determined and boosted by hormetic irritants and small amounts of toxic exposure. The theory that certain harder-to-digest foods, like wheat, may actually turn out to be important immune-boosters, particularly for gut immunity (linked to respiratory immunity), is gaining traction!19,7\n\nInstead of blaming the food or allergens for your health concerns, Ayurveda suggests that you can strengthen your barriers and digestive strength. Your barriers are the linings of your gut, lungs, skin, and the blood brain barrier that protect your body from exposure to pathogens and harmful toxics and toxins.\n\nIt is all about digestion. Digestion issues were deemed to be the cause of 85% of all disease thousands of years ago and today it could not be more true, making hormetic digestion practices an important factor in longevity.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hormesis for Digestion + Longevity: What Doesn\u2019t Kill You Makes You Stronger", "description": "How a small amount of an irritating substance, or anti-nutrient, can help you heal digestive woes, boost immunity, and more.", "url": "https://lifespa.com/health-topics/digestion/hormesis-digestion-longevity/", "site_name": "John Douillard's LifeSpa", "article:published_time": "2020-12-10T11:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-28T17:17:32+00:00", "image": "https://lifespa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/drinking-wine-Photo-by-Ales-Me-on-Unsplash-crop-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "2120", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["video"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#Hormesis-The_Good_Stress_That_Supports_Longevity", "#Examples_of_Hormesis_in_Nature1", "#Have_We_Become_Soft_as_We_Become_Farther_Removed_From_Nature", "#The_Wim_Hof_Method_Hormetic_Cold_Exposure", "#Eat_Wheat_or_Die", "#5_Reasons_Gluten_is_Good_For_You", "#The_Benefits_of_Hormetic_Irritants", "https://youtu.be/yT0qchQCjxs", "https://youtu.be/yT0qchQCjxs", "https://www.wimhofmethod.com/", "https://lifespa.com/benefits-naturally-occurring-food-toxins/", "https://digestive.lifespa.com/", "https://lifespa.com/gut-lung-skin-blood/", "https://store.lifespa.com/product/eat-wheat/"], "authors": ["Dr. John Douillard, DC, CAP"], "publish_date": "2020-12-10T11:00:00+00:00"}
