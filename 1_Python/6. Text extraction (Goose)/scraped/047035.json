Both Pfizer and the FDA were fully aware the two-shot regimen was never going to work.\n\nThey also knew that thousands of people have died from the Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine just three months into the vaccination program, the proof of which was included in the first batch of Pfizer documents released by the FDA. That would have been enough to stop the vaccine rollout.\n\nInstead, boosters were introduced and Pfizer\u2019s six-shot regimen now seems like a given. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not over yet, \u201d Wolf warned during her appearance in a podcast hosted by former BlackRock fund manager Edward Down.\n\n\u201cInevitably, there will be many more deaths and injuries, and people are still being denied informed consent,\u201d Brannon Howse noted in the May 16 episode of his Brighteon.TV program \u201cWorldview Report,\u201d which featured Dowd\u2019s interview of Wolf.\n\nWolf and her team had been tasked to review the documents made public about the Pfizer vaccine. These are the documents that the FDA wanted to keep hidden from the public. The agency was forced to release the documents by a federal judge.\n\nAccording to Wolf, the documents revealed that there are ingredients in the Pfizer vaccine that can do horrible things to the human body, such as propylene glycol and spiked protein. Propylene glycol is used in topical preparations and has not been used in injections.\n\nThe documents also hinted that nanoparticles were supposed to stay at the injection site within 48 hours. Pfizer and Moderna, whose vaccine also uses the mRNA technology, are aware that the nanoparticles and spiked protein go right into the bloodstream and end up in the liver, spleen, adrenals and ovaries.

The latest tranche of documents was released on April 1.\n\nPfizer CEO wants people to take annual COVID shot\n\nThe FDA seems convinced that Pfizer\u2019s original six-shot plan is the best way to protect the population. In late March, the agency gave emergency use authorization for a second booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines for older and immunocompromised individuals.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla wants to push his luck, suggesting that an annual shot of the COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to go. \u201cA vaccine that will be taken once a year is way easier to administer and we should have the population be compliant with it. We are working on that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe made this suggestion during a press conference set up by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) where he talked about the creation of a new COVID vaccine. The Big Pharma executive said that what the world really needs is a vaccine that can last a year. He pointed out that COVID-19 is \u201cvery difficult to eradicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most likely scenario is that the virus will continue being with us for the years to come,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nMore related stories can be found at BigPharmaNews.com.\n\nWatch the full May 16 episode of \u201cWorldview Report With Brannon Howse\u201d below.
