That plume sent dioxins all around the region, including on food crops consumed by both animals and humans.\n\nThe threat of dioxin contamination in Ohio and Western Pennsylvania agriculture is nothing to scoff at, based on what has transpired. The following 10 food crops have the most acreage in Ohio, and could be the most at-risk in terms of dioxin contamination:\n\u2022 Soybeans \u2013 In 2021, Ohio farmers harvested nearly 4.9 million acres of it.\n\u2022 Corn \u2013 In 2021, Ohio farmers harvested around 3.3 million acres of corn for grain, and 160,000 acres of corn for silage.\n\u2022 Dairy products \u2013 As of Jan. 1, 2022, there were around 248,000 heads of dairy cattle in Ohio, with more than 5.6 billion pounds of milk being generated in 2021.\n\u2022 Hogs \u2013 As of December 2021, Ohio had an inventory of 2.8 million hogs, having produced nearly 1.4 billion pounds of pork that same year.\n\u2022 Cattle and calves \u2013 In 2021, Ohio boasted around 1.3 million heads of cattle, including 312,000 beef cows.\n\u2022 Chicken eggs \u2013 Out of all 50 states, Ohio ranks No. 3 for egg production, having produced more than 10.4 billion chicken eggs in 2021.\n\u2022 Broilers \u2013 Ohio currently ranks 16th in the nation for broiler production, producing more than 126 million heads of broiler chickens raised for meat every year.\n\u2022 Floriculture \u2013 Ohio currently ranks No. 6 in the nation for floriculture operations, of which there are 512 throughout the state, generating an estimated $269 million in sales in 2021 \u2013 Ohio ranks No. 5 nationally for floriculture sales.\n\u2022 Turkeys \u2013 In 2021, Ohio produced nearly 268 million pounds of turkey, ranking eighth in the nation for turkey production.\n\u2022 Wheat \u2013 Ohio harvested some 515,000 acres of wheat in 2021, which produced nearly 43.8 million bushels of winter wheat that same year.\n\nIs food grown in northeastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania still safe to consume?\n\nAll of these items and more, if they were grown in the path of the East Palestine dioxin plume, could be contaminated with dioxins and other noxious chemicals that landed on them over the past several weeks.\n\nSince dioxins are persistent and do not easily dissipate or biodegrade, they tend to build up wherever they land, including in soils, on plant leaves, and even in the consumed portions of crops (i.e., soybeans, wheat kernels, eggs, milk and chicken meat).\n\n\u201cBurning vinyl is the most serious source of dioxin in the environment \u2013 whether from trash incinerators, house fires or chemical spills,\u201d warned Eric Coppolino, writing for Planet Waves FM \u2013 Chiron Return.\n\n\u201cWhile vinyl chloride is a precursor chemical to making PVC, any time chlorinated compounds burn there will be dioxins created. And dioxin is a manufacturing byproduct of any manufacturing process involving chlorine, from \u2018disinfectants\u2019 to the bleaching of paper. There was plenty of dioxin in those tanker cars before they caught fire.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, government authorities \u201cnuked\u201d the town of East Palestine with dioxins. They also nuked everywhere that dioxin plume spread, rendering everything in its path contaminated with a cancer-causing poison that will now quietly make its way through the food chain.\n\n\u201cI am guessing southern Ontario in Canada will be affected,\u201d one commenter wrote, mentioning another area where the dioxin plume was predicted to have spread.\n\n\u201cLive by the chemical, die by the chemical,\u201d wrote another. \u201cAnd all so people can wipe their butts with bleached, lily-white toilet paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo who will be held accountable?\u201d asked another. \u201cMy guess is that nobody will be. Not in this lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut God takes this environmental disaster very seriously, it\u2019s His planet, His people and His animals and forests. Why would anyone want to pay for this type of thing, even IF they get a hundred pieces of gold, with their soul, for eternity no less?\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the chemical fallout in East Palestine can be found at Disaster.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Here are the top 10 Ohio agricultural products that might be contaminated with dioxins", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2023-02-22-top-10-ohio-agricultural-products-contaminated-dioxins.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "The \u201ccontrolled explosion\u201d of the derailed Norfolk Southern freight train in East Palestine, Ohio, released what some say is the largest chemical dioxin plume in history.
