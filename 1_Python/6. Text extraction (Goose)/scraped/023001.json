McKean was the granddaughter of former attorney general and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. The circumstances of her death are puzzling. McKean supposedly took off in a canoe, and brought her young son with her, to retrieve a ball that had been kicked into the water. On this day, reports indicated that the water was even more turbulent than usual. Some thought it strange that anyone, let alone someone from such a wealthy family, would take a canoe out in such treacherous conditions in order to save an easily replaceable ball. But she did.\n\nOnline posters were quick to attribute the deaths to a combination of two oft-cited mainstream mythologies: the Kennedy \u201ccurse\u201d and their alleged \u201crecklessness.\u201d What wasn\u2019t noted as often was McKean\u2019s very interesting job, especially given the present worldwide coronavirus crisis. McKean was the executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Global Health Initiative (GHI), connecting her to the man rapidly becoming the arch villain of our times, Bill Gates. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded GHI, a typically globalist endeavor.\n\nMcKean seems to have been steadfastly pro-vaccine and publicly denounced the controversial position of her uncle, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., several times. RFK Jr., however, reacted angrily in the wake of his niece\u2019s death, taking to Instagram and launching a vicious attack on Gates. \u201cVaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201cthat feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft\u2019s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control over global health policy\u2014the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism.\u201d RFK Jr. continued, \u201cGates\u2019s obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.\u201d Kennedy wrote this on April 8, not long after the bodies of his relatives had been found in the Chesapeake Bay. It is difficult not to connect the deaths and Kennedy\u2019s powerful new public criticism of Gates.\n\nRFK Jr.\u2019s April 8 Instagram post has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s as radical a demolition of Gates\u2019s maniacal stance as any \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d could conjure up. \u201cPromising to eradicate polio with $1.2 billion, Gates took control of India\u2019s National Advisory Board (NAB) and mandated 50 polio vaccines (up from five) to every child before age five,\u201d Kennedy lashed out at one of the world\u2019s richest people. \u201cIndian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine-strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children\u2026. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates\u2019s vaccine regimen and evicted Gates and his cronies from the NAB. Polio paralysis rates dropped precipitously. In 2017, the World Health Organization reluctantly admitted that the global polio explosion is predominantly a vaccine strain, meaning it is coming from Gates\u2019s vaccine program.\u201d\n\nKennedy also noted that, \u201cIn 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a trial of a GSK [Glaxo-SmithKline] experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effect\u2026 to 1,048 of the 5,049 children [and] Gates operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis.\u201d Diving fully into conspiratorial waters, Kennedy declared, \u201cIn 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO promising to reduce population, in part, through new vaccines. A month later Gates told a Ted Talk that new vaccines \u2018could reduce population.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRFK Jr. has been consistently attacking Gates ever since. On May 6, he wrote, \u201cBill Gates Wants to Chip Us and Not Only for Vaccines\u2014for Surveillance and Transhumanism Using #5G.\u201d Showing he is opposed to the lockdown, Kennedy continued, \u201cI wrote last week about Malibu police\u2019s ticketing Point Dume surfers $1,000 apiece for using the ocean during the quarantine. Was this merely an appalling police judgment at which we will laugh post-quarantine? Or does anyone else feel that this is the first wave of compliance and obedience training for something more permanent? Are powerful state and corporate entities using the current crisis to remove basic rights and intensify pressures to promote vaccines and surveillance? Does anyone else feel the suffocating darkness of tyranny descending on our nation? And finally, does anyone share my dread that Bill Gates\u2014and his \u2018Mini-Me\u2019\u2014Tony Fauci\u2014will some how be running our Brave New World?\u201d\n\nDonald Jeffries is a highly respected author and researcher whose work on the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations and other high crimes of the Deep State has been read by millions of people across the world.
