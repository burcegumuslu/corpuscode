Other partners include FDA, Kaiser Permanente, Rockefeller, and Humana, as per the Tennessee Department of Health, which cites these as part of the bio of the PGP CEO, Dr. Joe Smyser.\n\nAnd the Public Goods Project in the past received funding not from lobbyists for just any corporate players but those strongly interested in stomping out any vaccine hesitancy \u2013 namely, vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nTo add another \u201cingredient\u201d into this \u201cdish\u201d that will appear unsavory to many, the New York City\u2019s Health Department Misinformation Response Unit was also among those the PGP has in its portfolio of collaborations.\n\nBut things get more granular from there. The PGP operates an initiative called Shots Heard, while another one with a similar mission is called Team Halo and is the brainchild of the United Nations Verified initiative and the Vaccine Confidence Project.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CDC 'behavior change' project targeted vaccine critics, funded by Pfizer and NY Misinformation Response Unit - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "Public Good Project describes itself as a public health nonprofit with focus on \u201clarge-scale media monitoring programs", "url": "https://usahitman.com/cdc-behavior-change-project-targeted-vaccine-critics-funded-by-pfizer-and-ny-misinformation-response-unit/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-04-08T13:50:09+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-16T16:11:26+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gkg.png", "image:width": "224", "image:height": "225", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["Covid", "Medical Misinformation", "Public Good Projects", "Misinformation", "Social media", "Vaccines", "United Nations", "CDC"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://reclaimthenet.org/new-york-misinformation-response-unit", "https://reclaimthenet.org/topics/united-nations", "https://reclaimthenet.org/cdc-behavior-change-project-targeted-vaccine-critics"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-04-08T13:50:09+00:00"}
