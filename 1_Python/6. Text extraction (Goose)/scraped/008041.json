Yet, we review studies that could be relevant for those concerned with neurological conditions. Everyone is biologically different, and people need to be able to make educated decisions on vaccines for themselves and loved ones.\n\nStudies have not been completed on specific vaccines and tics, with or without thimerosal, which has now been phased out of most, but not all, vaccines in the USA. See ingredients in vaccines here and CDC info on vaccines and thimerosal here.\n\nThis article summarizes four studies on the use of thimerosal in vaccines and its effect on neurodevelopmental delays.\n\nThe research was published between 2004 and 2008.\n\nIt is striking that the development of tics was the most common consequence of thimerosal exposure based on the study of select conditions. We should point out that there is some controversy regarding the statistical approaches used in the different studies, particularly because some studies do not show a link to autism while others do.\n\nTo read the abstracts for each study, click on the links below. Our short summary is provided to show the consistent tic connection. As you will see, other neurological conditions were also found to be negatively affected by the thimerosal.\n\nThis discovery on the relationship between the toxin methylmercury and the development of tics is hugely important. First, it highlights the relationship between tics and neurotoxins. This should put families on alert that they should not only avoid all exposures to toxins but should also consider evaluation for toxic overload, with follow-up treatment plans developed as needed. Second, given the results of this research, thimerosal exposure should be avoided by those with tics and Tourette syndrome as well as pregnant women. It is currently standard in flu vaccines, but you can request to have the vaccine without the preservative thimerosal.\n\nDon\u2019t believe it?

Results: In phase I at HMO A, cumulative exposure at 3 months resulted in a significant positive association with tics.

With the possible exception of tics, there was no evidence that thimerosal exposure via DTP/DT vaccines causes neurodevelopmental disorders.
