Today\u2026For The World You\u2019ll Live In Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nProtest Rocked West Nears War Against \u201cLeader Of Free World\u201d To Hide \u201cMysterious Covid Truth\u201d\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nA forewarning new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today first noting leftist fake news American mainstream media outlet CBS News citing the customary unnamed US intelligence \u201csources\u201d yesterday to warn that Russia is set to launch a winter invasion of Ukraine, with them stating: \u201cAn incursion is weather-dependent, but could happen in a matter of weeks, barring intervention from the West\u201d, says quick to join this absurd war propaganda was new Ukrainian Defense Minster Alexey Reznikov, who warned that President Putin is \u201cplaying chess\u201d with the West, and stated: \u201cHe is testing the unity of the European Union, he is testing the unity of NATO allies, he is testing our society, Ukrainians, he is testing Poland, the Baltic countries\u201d\u2014a sudden ratcheting up of Western war propaganda causing defense historians like Professor Glenn Diesen at the University of South-Eastern Norway to warn: \u201cA Russia-NATO war over Ukraine is becoming increasingly unavoidable\u201d\u2014sees none of these Western war propagandists explaining why anyone would be so insane to launch a war during a brutal Russian Winter that has defeated every enemy throughout history\u2014and in response to these Western lunatics, this morning Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov most accurately observed: \u201cUkraine is most likely seeking to make another attempt at resolving its own problem through military means; create another disaster for themselves and for everyone in Europe\u2026This is what Ukraine is striving for\u2026And it is trying to achieve this, most likely, under the cover of those very NATO exercises near Russia's borders, NATO ships in the Black Sea, US and British soldiers in the region, of which there are more and more\u201d.\n\nAs these \u201cWinds Of War\u201d continue blowing over Europe like they did last century fanning the flames for World War II, this report notes, unlike those past times when the United States was looked upon as the savior of the free world, its rapid plunge into demonic evil led by Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden today sees it being feared and reviled the world over\u2014a fact noted yesterday by His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, who in commenting on the flood of Orthodox Christians that have fled to Russia for freedom from the United States declared: \u201cI can imagine the types of reaction to my words from different corners, but I can prove that Russia today is the true leader of the free world...We\u2019re free from the most powerful influences from abroad...We\u2019re developing in accordance with our own path and, by God\u2019s will, our path shall be successful...Russia can serve as an example for others\u201d.\n\nAdding to his declaration that \u201cRussia today is the true leader of the free world\u201d, this report continues, His Holiness said: \u201cWe currently don\u2019t have a hot-button issue that would make societal interests collide and produce deep, irreconcilable contradictions\u201d, with him adding that Russia \u201cbenefited from a healthy diversity of opinion that doesn\u2019t destroy the foundations of human and spiritual life\u201d.\n\nUnlike in Russia where the \u201cfoundations of human and spiritual life\u201d are enshrined in constitutional law and respected above all else, this report notes, peoples living under socialist siege in Western nations watched in horror as their tyrannical leaders used scamdemic fears of Covid to strip them of all their rights\u2014the consequence of which saw tens-of-thousands of Australians marching for freedom yesterday\u2014saw hundreds-of-thousands of Europeans rising up in every country for freedom\u2014that includes the tens-of-thousands of freedom protesters taking over every city in Italy and the over 100,000 freedom protesters that took over in Zagreb-Croatia\u2014and in Rotterdam-Netherlands this weekend, it shockingly saw police firing live rounds into massive crowds of rampaging freedom protesters.\n\nFueling the rage of these Western freedom protesters fighting back against their despotic elite socialist leaders, this report explains, was the European Medicines Agency (EMA) releasing data this past week showing that experimental Covid vaccines have injured 1,163,356 and killed a staggering 30,551 innocent European citizens\u2014a shocking death toll caused by experimental Covid vaccines revelation that was joined by British health authorities grimly reporting that vaccinated English adults under 60 are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people the same age.\n\nIn the United States yesterday, this report continues, the CDC grimly reported that under socialist leader Biden twice as many people have died of Covid in 2021 than under President Trump in 2020\u2014sees the CDC reporting \u201cCOVID-19 was the third leading underlying cause of death in 2020, replacing suicide as one of the top 10 leading causes of death\u201d and revealing \u201cOverall age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates were lowest among Asian and Hispanic persons and highest among Black and American Indian and Alaska Native persons\u201d\u2014sees the CDC further revealing \u201cAbout 59% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, and some 17% have received booster shots\u201d, and them further reporting that \u201c81% of COVID-19 deaths hit people ages 65 and up last year, that group represents about 69% of this year\u2019s deaths\u201d.\n\nIn stark contrast to the European Medicines Agency, this report details, the CDC continues obfuscate the true number of those injured and killed by experimental Covid vaccines\u2014but when looking at the US government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), as of 12 November, it documents that 1,742,488 innocent Americans have been injured by experimental Covid vaccines\u2014sees it documenting \u201c94,537 Total COVID Vaccine Reported Hospitalizations And 174,987 Total Reported Hospitalizations\u201d\u2014and most grimly documents \u201c18,853 COVID Vaccine Reported Deaths\u201d\u2014all of which comes at the same time it bears noticing that the highest rates for Covid-related hospitalizations and deaths are occurring in highly-vaccinated socialist Democrat Party iron grip controlled Blue States.\n\nAs of 1 November, this report notes, the CDC would only confirm that 9,367 innocent Americans died because of experimental Covid vaccines\u2014a number most critical to notice because it\u2019s three-times higher than the 3,000 people total that have died from Covid since the pandemic began in Africa\u2019s largest country Nigeria, that has a population of over 200-million\u2014is a \u201cMysterious Covid Truth\u201d being kept from the American people as to why the entire African continent has only 6% of its 1.2-billion population vaccinated, but has the lowest death Covid rate in the entire world\u2014but whose mystery about that today has \u201cscientists mystified\u201d, becomes more than explainable if these Americans were told the truth about their Amish peoples, who like hundreds-of-millions of Africans, infected themselves with the Covid virus last year when the pandemic first began, then went about living their normal lives without masks, experimental vaccines, hospitalizations or deaths.\n\nThe conclusion section of this transcript sees Security Council Members wondering how the American people would react if they were allowed to know the truth that more of their loved ones have died from experimental Covid vaccines than have died of this disease in Africa\u2019s largest country\u2014though they note that these Americans still haven\u2019t heeded the warning from a brave Chinese citizen pleading to them \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop advocating, because if you don\u2019t speak out, maybe it\u2019s your furry babies that will die next\u201d as Biden and his demonic socialist forces continue their plot to kill every pet puppy, kitten, dog and cat in American on their alter of Covid madness.
