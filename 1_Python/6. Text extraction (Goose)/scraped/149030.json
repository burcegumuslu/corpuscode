Loved ones say he was wasn\u2019t depressed nor was he showing signs of depression. The only thing different in his life was the addition of the drug Tamiflu, which had been in his system for less than 24 hours, prescribed to lessen the symptoms of influenza.\n\u2022 ABC: 6-year-old girl hallucinates, tries to jump out window after taking Tamiflu\n\nHis family is speaking out because they don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else.\n\nJackie Ray, Charlie\u2019s aunt and guardian said they \u201cstarted it right in the car, get it in him and get him started.\u201d When she texted Charlie the next day and didn\u2019t get a response, she knew something was wrong. She sent her husband Brad home to check on him and he discovered the teen had committed suicide in the garage.\n\u2022 This Beats the Flu Shot Nearly 10-Fold for Preventing the Flu\n\nAlthough the Tamilfu warning label clearly states pediatric patients may be at an increased risk of confusion or abnormal behavior the Rays say they were not properly warned just what that could mean.\n\n\u201cFOX59 reached out to the maker of Tamiflu. A spokesperson said they can\u2019t comment on this specific case at this time but released the following statement. \u2018Neuropsychiatric events have been reported during the administration of Tamiflu in patients with influenza, especially in children and adolescents.'\u201d\n\nIf you are diagnosed with influenza and prescribed Tamiflu- RUN. Again, the drug cannot cure you and will only lessen your SYMPTOMS by TWELVE HOURS. The benefits most certainly do not outweigh the risks.\n\u2022 Just Remember\u2026 There is no Flu Season\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Charlie.
