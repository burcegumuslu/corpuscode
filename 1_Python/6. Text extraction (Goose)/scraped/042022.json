But in just days it had ballooned tenfold. And within two weeks, it had turned into a full-blown public protest, with people waving picket signs to denounce efforts to push them to receive coronavirus vaccines.\n\nBut these were not just any vaccine resisters. They were nurses, medical technicians, infection control officers and other staff who work at a hospital in Staten Island, which has the highest rate of COVID-19 infection of any borough in New York City.\n\nAll New York City public school teachers and other staffers will have to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, officials said Monday, ramping up pandemic protections as the nation\u2019s largest school system prepares for classes to start next month.\n\nThe city previously said teachers, like other city employees, would have to get the shots or get tested weekly for the virus. The new policy marks the first no-option vaccination mandate for a broad group of city workers in the nation\u2019s most populous city, though Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that coaches and students in football, basketball and other \u201chigh-risk\u201d sports would have to get inoculated before play begins.\n\nNow, about 148,000 school employees \u2014 and contractors who work in schools \u2014 will have to get at least a first dose by Sept. 27, according to an announcement from the Democratic mayor and the city health and education departments.\n\nThe U.S. military will move to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for all service members now that the Pfizer vaccine has full approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Pentagon\u2019s top spokesperson announced Monday.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is \u201cprepared to issue updated guidance requiring all service members to be vaccinated,\u201d Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters.\n\nIt is no secret that Big Tech\u2019s news and information monopoly has created a big problem for news publishers and content creators across the U.S.\n\nGoogle News, Facebook News, and analogous news aggregator sites drive a great deal of traffic to their respective sites by presenting a continuous flow of links to articles from thousands of publishers.\n\nThese aggregator websites are, in turn, able to monetize their own advertising and related products \u2014 and are able to do so without fairly compensating publishers for their material. As a result, the publishing industry has been on life support for over a decade.\n\nBig Tech Companies Have Profiles on You \u2013 Here\u2019s How to See Them\n\nIt should be no surprise to anybody that social media and tech companies gather a lot of information about you. In most cases, you supply the data willingly (or sometimes begrudgingly) so that you can access their services. Tap or click here for 10 Facebook privacy and security settings you need to change right now.\n\nBut many people don\u2019t know that almost every Big Tech company has at least some information on you. If you think about it, where do you suppose targeted advertising comes from? How do they know which ads to serve you?\n\nApple, Google, and companies like Facebook all have a profile on you. But what exactly do they know? Well, there is a way for you to find out.\n\nHealthcare Systems Wary of Instituting COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate Over Fears of Losing Staff\n\nHealthcare providers hesitate to require workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of employment, fearing a mandate could cause the resignations of staff they cannot afford to lose.\n\n\u201c[Hospitals] are doing a balancing act between caring for patients and not contributing to the pandemic by spreading COVID-19 through unvaccinated clinicians,\u201d said Audrey Capozzoli, president of Renal Reserve, a national dialysis staffing agency. \u201cHospitals that mandate vaccinations and may terminate employees who refuse to get them could find themselves short-staffed. This leads to staff burnout and further reduction of qualified clinicians.\u201d\n\nWhy National Teachers Unions Support Vaccine Mandates But Won\u2019t Require Them\n\nThis fall, as many schools across the country are planning to reopen for full in-person learning, parents and educators are bracing for the third straight school year to be disrupted by COVID-19.\n\nAnd yet, according to one survey by the Center for Reinventing Public Education, of the 100 biggest urban school districts in the nation, only 13 have some requirement that teachers be vaccinated. Just seven of those \u2014 Chicago, Denver, D.C, Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles, and as of Monday, New York City \u2014 have made the vaccine requirement universal for all school staff.\n\nWhich means that the vast majority of biggest school districts in the country are allowing at least some unvaccinated teachers into the classroom, even if they have other safety requirements, like testing or masking.\n\nCOVID Vaccine Protesters Rally in Santa MonicaBig Tech Has Outgrown This Planet\n\nA coalition of groups including medical professionals, first responders, parents and students will gather in Santa Monica Saturday to protest Los Angeles\u2019 impending COVID-19 vaccine mandate, saying it will segregate the city, breed more hate and violate the rights of tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe \u201cS.O.S California No Vaccine Passport Rally\u201d is being organized by the California chapter of Children\u2019s Health Defense, California Parents United, Latinos for Medical Freedom, Central Coast Health Coalition, Advocates for Physicians Rights, America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, Vaccine Injury Awareness League, Freedom of Religion \u2014 United Solutions, Protection of the Educational Rights of Kids, Freedom Angels, UtahRevival.com, Mama Bears Radio and Million Mamas Movement.\n\nThe already bonkers dollars of Big Tech have become even bonkers-er.\n\nMy colleagues and I have written a lot about the unreal sales, profits and oomph of America\u2019s five technology titans \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook. This might feel like old news. Tech\u2019s Titanic 5 have been big and rich for a long time, and they\u2019ve gotten even more so as people and organizations have needed their products during the coronavirus pandemic. Yadda, yadda, yadda. We get it.\n\nBut no, we really don\u2019t get it. American\u2019s technology superstars have launched into a completely different stratosphere than even other wildly successful companies in tech and beyond.\n\nProtesters on Monday have stormed London HQ office of ITN, which produces ITV News and Channel 4 News.\n\nFootage circulated on social media showed cops lining up to barricade the entrance to the building on Gray\u2019s Inn Road.\n\nHowever, a large number of demonstrators, who appear to be part of a protest against coronavirus vaccine passports, appear to have already entered the ITN building.\n\nThe post Hospital Finds an Unlikely Group Opposing Vaccination: Its Workers + More appeared first on Children\u2019s Health Defense.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Awake Canada", "type": "article", "title": "Hospital Finds an Unlikely Group Opposing Vaccination: Its Workers + More", "description": "Hospital Finds an Unlikely Group Opposing Vaccination: Its Workers\nThe New York Times reported:\u00a0\nTheir movement started discreetly, just a handful of people communicating on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Signal.
