Daszak wrote that he wanted \u201cto avoid the appearance of a political statement\u201d.\n\nThe scientists\u2019 letter appeared in The Lancet on February 18, just one week after the World Health Organization announced that the disease caused by the novel coronavirus would be named COVID-19.\n\nThe 27 authors \u201cstrongly condemn[ed] conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,\u201d and reported that scientists from multiple countries \u201coverwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.\u201d The letter included no scientific references to refute a lab-origin theory of the virus. One scientist, Linda Saif, asked via email whether it would be useful \u201cto add just one or 2 statements in support of why nCOV is not a lab generated virus and is naturally occuring? Seems critical to scientifically refute such claims!\u201d Daszak responded, \u201cI think we should probably stick to a broad statement.\u201d\n\nGrowing calls to investigate the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a potential source of SARS-CoV-2 have led to increased scrutiny of EcoHealth Alliance. The emails show how members of EcoHealth Alliance played an early role in framing questions about possible lab origin of SARS-CoV-2 as \u201ccrackpot theories that need to be addressed,\u201d as Daszak told The Guardian.\n\nAlthough the phrase \u201cEcoHealth Alliance\u201d appeared only once in The Lancet statement, in association with co-author Daszak, several other co-authors also have direct ties to the group that were not disclosed as conflicts of interest. Rita Colwell and James Hughes are members of the Board of Directors of EcoHealth Alliance, William Karesh is the group\u2019s Executive Vice President for Health and Policy, and Hume Field is Science and Policy Advisor.\n\nThe statement\u2019s authors also claimed that the \u201crapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins.\u201d Today, however, little is known about the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and investigations into its origins by the World Health Organization and The Lancet COVID-19 commission have been shrouded in secrecy and mired by conflicts of interests.\n\nPeter Daszak, Rita Colwell, and The Lancet Editor Richard Horton did not provide comments in response to our requests for this story.\n\nThis article is reprinted from the website of US Right to Know.\n\nA link to the entire batch of EcoHealth Alliance emails can be found here: EcoHealth Alliance emails: University of Maryland (466 pages)\n\nU.S. Right to Know is posting documents obtained through public freedom of information (FOI) requests for our Biohazards investigation in our post: FOI documents on origins of SARS-CoV-2, hazards of gain-of-function research and biosafety labs.\n\nEditor\u2019s note.
