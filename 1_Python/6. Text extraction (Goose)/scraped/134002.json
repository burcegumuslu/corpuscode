Not likely. Sigma is 74 so it\u2019s a 29-sigma increase. In other words, this increase in death didn\u2019t happen by chance; something caused it.\n\nThe data from the Ontario website\n\nWe know the vax makes you more likely to get COVID. If you had 3 shots, the Cleveland Clinic study showed you are about 2.5X more likely to get COVID. So that big spike in cases in 2022 is totally expected: it was our own doing. The more people who got COVID, the more people who died from COVID.\n\nYou\u2019re less likely to die from a COVID case in 2022 than in 2021 because the variant is less deadly, not because the vaccine worked.\n\nWas this because the virus was more deadly in 2022? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nLet\u2019s look the world\u2019s least vaccinated countries: Yemen, Haiti, and PNG. As you can see, deaths are way down in 2022 because the variants are less lethal:\n\nThese numbers show that the \u201cit would have been worse if people weren\u2019t vaccinated\u201d excuse won\u2019t hold any water.\n\nFurthermore, we know the vaccines are super deadly. Consider the following recent post which is based on CDC data:\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t the vaccine that caused this dramatic rise, what caused it?\n\nAlso, even the US data shows a decrease in 2022 vs. 2021, so it\u2019s hard for Ontario to argue that the virus was more deadly in 2022:\n\nThis visualization was done on the CDC website on the Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths page.\n\nSo there is no rock they can hide under.\n\nOf course, this is embarrassing for the narrative which is why nobody is talking about it.\n\nEven Professor David Fisman is silent about the report. I reached out to him for an explanation and he ignored it, exactly as expected.\n\nThis is why there is no press coverage of this: because the numbers are inexplicable if the vaccine worked.\n\nI just thought you\u2019d like to know.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the mainstream press isn\u2019t covering this.\n\nI can\u2019t figure out why. The press is supposed to report this and get comments from both sides. Instead, they ignore the story.\n\nA nearly 40% increase in COVID deaths and the mainstream press ignores the story!?! WTF is going on here?\n\nBut I thought people would want to know the truth.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.
