You can expect grand jury indictments of leftist politicians like Biden, Pelosi and Schumer as surely as night follows day,\u201d said Tom Fitton, president @JudicialWatch in an interview with the New York Post. \u201cYou can be sure there are prosecutors across Florida and Texas right now who are looking for a state law hook into the Biden family. And if they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not doing their jobs.\u201d\n\nTrump, 76, is the first former president to confront criminal charges, which come as he prepares for a potential 2024 presidential rematch against Biden.\n\nThe Post reported on Friday that the then-sealed indictment is supposedly based on a new theory of document forgery promoted by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, concerning Trump\u2019s hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe former president pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts related to accounting of alleged hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels at the height of the 2016 election,\u201d Fox News reported Tuesday after Trump appeared in a Manhattan courtroom to face the charges. He faces a maximum sentence of 136 years, but no one in their right mind believes Trump\u2019s going to serve a day behind bars, let alone that the case against him is even legitimate.\n\nMeanwhile, others agreed with Fitton that GOP prosecutors are now free to go after the Bidens and any other high profile Democratic president and political figure suspected of committing crimes.\n\nRepublicans need to learn how to take off the gloves and put on the brass knuckles and break glass jaws \u2014 politically and legally, not physically,\u201d Mike Davis, a former chief counsel for nominations on the Senate Judiciary Committee and president of the Article III Project, told The Post.\n\n\u201cIf New York can turn a routine settlement of a business dispute seven years ago into a felony, I think our Republican AGs and DAs should get creative,\u201d added Davis, who briefly worked as a federal prosecutor before clerking for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make it right, but it makes it even.\n\n\u201cYou just need probable cause. A grand jury can indict a ham sandwich. We just saw that in New York. And the Bidens actually committed real crimes. These are real crimes that the Bidens committed. There is smoking gun evidence that the Bidens were corruptly and illegally on Chinese and Ukrainian oligarchs\u2019 payrolls,\u201d Davis noted further.\n\nJoe Arpaio, a close ally of Trump and the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, has expressed his belief that there is a \u201cdouble standard\u201d in the legal system against Republicans like Trump. Arpaio was pardoned by Trump in 2017 in a criminal contempt case.\n\n\u201cThe criminal justice system is not always fair, believe me, and this is an example,\u201d Arpaio told The Post.\n\n\u201cThis sets a little precedent,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow the word is out that you can go and indict an ex-president and a current president and they opened another door. But now everybody\u2019s going to flex their muscles and use this case.
