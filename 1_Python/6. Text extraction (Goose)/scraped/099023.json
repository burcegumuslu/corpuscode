She finds increased numbers of cancers, in younger patients, which are larger in size and growing more rapidly and aggressively already at the time of the initial diagnosis. Her findings agree with reports by other pathologists, e.g. Dr. Ryan Cole\n\nWhile the exact mechanism of the apparent increase in cancers remains to be established, both immunosuppression (evident e.g. from increased case numbers of shingles) and insertion of DNA copies of the mRNA vaccines into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell are plausible candidates. DNA insertion has been demonstrated in vitro in a human cell line:\n\n1. Alden, M. et al.
