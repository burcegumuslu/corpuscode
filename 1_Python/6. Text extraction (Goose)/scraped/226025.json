Heart damage from the mRNA booster shots appears to be a much higher risk than previously thought, the recent findings show.\n\n777 employees of Basel University Hospital, median age 37 years and 69% female, had received booster vaccination. After 3 days, their troponin levels (hs-cTnT) were measured. Troponin is a laboratory value that indicates acute damage to the heart.\n\n\u201c40 subjects showed elevated troponin levels. In 18 of these cases, other causes were present. The remaining 22 cases corresponded to an incidence of 2.8%. The incidence in women was 3.7% and in men only 0.8%,\u201d reports transparenztest.de. \u201cMost of the subjects had no cardiovascular history. Three days after vaccination, their troponin levels (hs-cTnT) were measured to detect cardiac damage. If levels were elevated, another hs-cTnT measurement and imaging examination followed the next day.\u201d\n\nThe surprising results were presented at the 2022 ESC Congress.\n\nIt had been previously suggested that such complications were very rare, with an incidence in the range of only 0.0035%. But the new study results suggest it\u2019s far worse.\n\nAccording to Prof. Christian M\u00fcller: \u201cThe study confirms the hypothesis that the incidence of acute cardiac involvement is higher than thought. At 2.8% it was 800 times higher than in passive observational studies. But now that we need annual booster vaccinations, there could be a lot of vaccine-related cardiac involvement.\u201d\n\nProf. Christian M\u00fcller adds. \u201cFrom day 3 to day 4, we observed a clear drop in troponin in almost all participants, indicating that this was an acute problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incidence of 2.8% of acute cardiac involvement is alarmingly high,\u201d transparenztest.de warns. \u201cThus, 1 out of 35 boostered persons shows such values shortly after the mRNA vaccination. Converted, one would have e.g. with 350,000 booster vaccinations consequently 10,000 persons or with 3.5 million 100,000 persons, who show such laboratory values of an acute heart damage.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Pandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.transparenztest.de/post/alarmierend-1-von-35-geboosterten-hat-laborwerte-die-auf-akute-herzschaedigung-hinweisen", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9484848/", "https://www.transparenztest.de/post/alarmierend-1-von-35-geboosterten-hat-laborwerte-die-auf-akute-herzschaedigung-hinweisen", "https://www.transparenztest.de/post/alarmierend-1-von-35-geboosterten-hat-laborwerte-die-auf-akute-herzschaedigung-hinweisen", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGZJfVR9-wo"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
