Anything and everything is fair game when it comes to the ongoing effort by the Marxist Left to get rid of the most pro-America president in generations.\n\nNow, so-called \u201cfact-checking\u201d websites like Snopes have also ditched all remaining vestiges of journalistic integrity, declaring, outright, that even fake news and phony narratives are okay in the Trump era because, you know, he\u2019s such a threat to democracy.\n\nIn a stunning admission (of what we already knew), Snopes reprinted an essay Thursday arguing that Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are such unique threats to the world that \u201cexperts must find new ways to reach people.\u201d Which means that \u2014 get this \u2014 Trump and Johnson must be \u201ccountered by the shared stories, experiences and emotions of real people and how they are affected by the big global issues.\u201d\n\nSnopes has long been accused of lying about \u2018facts\u2019 in order to push a Left-wing political narrative. The site refused to correct lies surrounding Native American \u2018activist\u2019 Nathan Phillips, who tried to provoke pro-Trump children from a Catholic school in Kentucky, \u2018fact-checks\u2019 obvious satire, and covered for Obama\u2019s ransom payment to Iran for American hostages so he could do his bogus \u201cnuclear deal\u201d with the terrorist-sponsoring regime.\n\nAs for the essay Snopes reprinted, it was originally a blog post by Profs. David Knights and Torkild Thanem. First published by The Conservation, Snopes ran it in full.\n\nIf you cherish truth and freedom, your garbage and your viewpoints need to be \u2018dismissed\u2019\n\n\u201cPublic austerity measures, for example, are not simply about financial facts,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIndeed, when presented merely as economic data, many people can neither identify with nor understand them. Instead, austerity poses problems that compel us to examine how they affect people and families in their daily lives. The experiences of those individuals must be shared.\u201d\n\nBoth academics also made similarly arcane points when discussing Brexit \u2014 Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union, which was actually decided on in June 2016 but has yet to occur because globalists in that country and in the EU continue to throw up roadblocks.\n\n\u201cWhether examining Brexit, public austerity measures or the effects of climate change, one limitation is that facts and data generated through quantitative social research are presented as if detached from the people they concern as well as those involved in their production,\u201d the authors write. \u201cFar removed from people\u2019s lived experiences, they risk displacing any sense of what it is to be human. As such, they are, perhaps, too easy to dismiss.\u201d\n\nThere you have it. If you were one of the 51.9 percent of British subjects who voted to leave the EU and, you know, have a totally independent country, then you\u2019re not a human so your views should be \u2018dismissed.\u201d\n\nNolte writes that it is actually a positive thing that we are seeing columns like this appear and that \u201cfact checkers\u201d like Snopes are providing them with a platform. It\u2019s good to see the \u2018enemy\u2019 drop his mask and reveal who he is.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Snopes posted the article without any caveat \u2014 that is, without saying something like, \u2018Hey, this doesn\u2019t reflect our editorial opinion\u2019 \u2014 which further reveals the site\u2019s commitment to propaganda and fabrication over facts that it doesn\u2019t like.\n\nThe problem is, far too many people still believe these people and have no idea what their political objectives are: To undermine our republic and democracy everywhere.\n\nRead more news about Snopes propaganda at Snopes.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u201cFact-checking\u201d website Snopes throws aside FACTS to push anti-Trump, pro-globalist Left-wing agenda", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2019-10-14-snopes-ignores-facts-push-anti-trump-globalist-agenda.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "It\u2019s getting to the point where you really can\u2019t trust anything published by the so-called \u201cmainstream media\u201d because it is concocted, fabricated narrative, or outright false \u2014 and this is especially true when it comes to anti-establishment politicians like President Donald Trump.
