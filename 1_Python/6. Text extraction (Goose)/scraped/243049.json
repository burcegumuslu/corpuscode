LaVeglia said the ruling extends to all public workers, including the New York fire department, the police department, and the Department of Corrections.\n\n\u201cFor all the brave men and women who have been our first responders and have been brave through all this are now free, and you should be able to go back to work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling does not specifically apply to all NYC workers, only those who filed the petition.\n\nGeorge Garvey and 15 others who worked at the New York City Department of Sanitation filed the lawsuit on July 20 after they were terminated for failing to comply with the mandate.\n\nJudge Ralph Porzio ruled against the city and found the mandate, which allowed exceptions, to have been an arbitrary and capricious order. He said that Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, \u201cmade a different decision for similarly situated people based on identical facts\u201d in his Executive Order No. 62.\n\nHowever, there wasn\u2019t anything in the record to \u201csupport the rationality of keeping a vaccination mandate for public employees, while vacating the mandate for private sector employees or creating a carveout for certain professions, like athletes, artists, and performers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is clearly an arbitrary and capricious action because we are dealing with identical unvaccinated people being treated differently by the same administrative agency,\u201d Porzio said in his ruling (pdf).\n\nThe ruling noted that all but one of the 16 petitioners applied for exemptions and received \u201cgeneralized and vague denials.\u201d They remained unvaccinated during the time their exemptions were being processed. Porzio said there was \u201cno reason\u201d they couldn\u2019t have been allowed to keep working while submitting to COVID-19 testing.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason why the City of New York could not continue with a vaccinate or test policy, like the Mayor\u2019s Executive Order that was issued in August 2021,\u201d the judge said in his ruling.\n\nThe judge affirmed vaccinations but said that public employees shouldn\u2019t have been \u201cterminated for their noncompliance\u201d with the mandate, noting that almost 80 percent of New York City is vaccinated.\n\nPorzio\u2019s ruling noted that \u201ccertain classes of people\u201d were granted vaccination exemptions, proving the mandate for public workers \u201cto be arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the Health Commissioner has the authority to issue public health mandates. No one is refuting that authority. However, the Health Commissioner cannot create a new condition of employment for City employees,\u201d Porzio said in his ruling.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 Executive Order No. 62 \u201crenders all of these vaccine mandates arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing vaccinated does not prevent an individual from contracting or transmitting COVID-19. As of the day of this Decision, CDC guidelines regarding quarantine and isolation are the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, Porzio said city workers shouldn\u2019t be terminated for choosing \u201cnot to protect themselves\u201d with a vaccine, noting that \u201cbreakthrough cases occur\u201d even for those who are vaccinated and boosted. He also noted that President Joe Biden has declared \u201cthe pandemic is over.\u201d\n\nThe judge noted that New York ended its COVID-19 state of emergency \u201cover a month ago.\u201d He also noted that the first responders named in the lawsuit continued to work without protective gear, and had \u201ccreated natural immunity\u201d after catching COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThey were terminated and are willing to come back to work for the City that cast them aside. The vaccination mandate for City employees was not just about safety and public health; it was about compliance. If it was about safety and public health, unvaccinated workers would have been placed on leave the moment the order was issued.\n\n\u201cIf it was about safety and public health, the Health Commissioner would have issued city-wide mandates for vaccination for all residents. In a City with a nearly 80 percent vaccination rate, we shouldn\u2019t be penalizing the people who showed up to work, at great risk to themselves and their families, while we were locked down.\n\n\u201cIf it was about safety and public health, no one would be exempt. It is time for the City of New York to do what is right and what is just,\u201d Porzio said in his ruling.\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
