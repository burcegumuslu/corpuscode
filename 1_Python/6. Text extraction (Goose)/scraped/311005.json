On Monday and Tuesday, screenshots of the section of the website in question were being shared across social media. It is reasonable to conclude that the WHO edited their website in response to this recent and unexpected attention.\n\nAccording to the Wayback Machine\u2019s archive, the WHO\u2019s vaccine advice page was unchanged from the first archive on April 8, 2021 until the change on June 22.\n\n\n\n Also on Tuesday, social media users were being penalized for sharing screenshots of the WHO\u2019s website, prior to the change.\n\nThis article is free and open source.
