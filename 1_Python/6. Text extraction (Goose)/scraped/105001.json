You may have noticed that researchers are now saying they have analyzed the virus that caused the 1918 global pandemic of flu. They are linking it to a bird virus, which stirs the pot on the current flap about avian flu in Asia. The PR goes this way: If this current bird virus mutates just a little bit in the wrong direction, we could see a replay of the 1918 disaster.\n\nHere is another analysis, written about 25 years ago by Eleanor McBean. This excerpt, from chapter two of her book, Vaccination Condemned, makes a quite different observation:\n\nI WAS AN ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVER OF THE 1918 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC \n\n All the doctors and people who were living at the time of the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic say it was the most terrible disease the world has ever had. Strong men, hale and hearty, one day would be dead the next. The disease had the characteristics of the black death added to typhoid, diphtheria, pneumonia, smallpox, paralysis and all the diseases the people had been vaccinated with immediately following World War 1. Practically the entire population had been injected \"seeded\" with a dozen or more diseases \u2014 or toxic serums. When all those doctor-made diseases started breaking out all at once it was tragic.\n\nThat pandemic dragged on for two years, kept alive with the addition of more poison drugs administered by the doctors who tried to suppress the symptoms. As far as I could find out, the flu hit only the vaccinated. Those who had refused the shots escaped the flu. My family had refused all the vaccinations so we remained well all the time. We knew from the health teachings of Graham, Trail, Tilden and others, that people cannot contaminate the body with poisons without causing disease.\n\nWhen the flu was at its peak, all the stores were closed as well as the schools, businesses \u2014 even the hospital, as the doctors and nurses had been vaccinated too and were down with the flu. No one was on the streets. It was like a ghost town. We [who didn\u2019t taken any vaccines] seemed to be the only family which didn\u2019t get the flu; so my parents went from house to house doing what they could to look after the sick, as it was impossible to get a doctor then. If it were possible for germs, bacteria, virus, or bacilli to cause disease, they had plenty of opportunity to attack my parents when they were spending many hours a day in the sick rooms. But they didn\u2019t get the flu and they didn\u2019t bring any germs home to attack us children and cause anything. None of our family had the flu \u2014 not even a sniffle\u2014 and it was in the winter with deep snow on the ground.\n\nIt has been said that the 1918 flu epidemic killed 20,000,000 people throughout the world. But, actually, the doctors killed them with their crude and deadly treatments and drugs. This is a harsh accusation but it is nevertheless true, judging by the success of the drugless doctors in comparison with that of the medical doctors.\n\nWhile the medical men and medical hospitals were losing 33% of their flu cases, the non-medical hospitals such as BATTLE CREEK, KELLOGG and MACFADDEN\u2019S HEALTH-RESTORIUM were getting almost 100% healings with their water cure, baths, enemas, etc., fasting and certain other simple healing methods, followed by carefully worked out diets of natural foods. One health doctor didn\u2019t lose a patient in eight years. The very successful health treatment of one of those drugless doctors who didn\u2019t lose any patients will be given in the other part of this book, titled VACCINATION CONDEMNED, to be published a little later.\n\nIf the medical doctors had been as advanced as the drugless doctors, there would not have been those 20 million deaths from the medical flu treatment.\n\nThere was seven times more disease among the vaccinated soldiers than among the unvaccinated civilians, and the diseases were those they had been vaccinated against. One soldier who had returned from overseas in 1912 told me that the army hospitals were filled with cases of infantile paralysis and he wondered why grown men should have an infant disease. Now, we know that paralysis is a common after-effect of vaccine poisoning. Those at home didn\u2019t get the paralysis until after the world-wide vaccination campaign in 1918.\n\nFEBRUARY 7, 2004. The Washington Post reports on a new EPA study that shows twice as many newborn babies have dangerous levels of the neurotoxin mercury than previously suspected.\n\nThere are two possible key inferences here: one, these dangerous levels of mercury are being pushed over the top by vaccines given shortly after birth; or the babies' mercury levels are being measured before these vaccines are given---in which case certain vaccines are passing on yet MORE mercury.\n\nIn either case, it's a disaster in progress.\n\nFrom Chapter 2 - Survival Factor in Neoplastic and Viral Diseases\n\nVACCINE PROBLEMS\n\n From what was stated so far it is seen that vaccines for a specific virus do not immunize against the nucleoprotein that is the actual pathogen, especially after it has penetrated and integrated with the host cell, so to talk about curing cancer with vaccines or immune sera is a waste of time. Even the prevention of viral infection by vaccines is meeting the strongest statistical opposition since large-scale smallpox and Salk vaccinations have been recorded. In line with what is known about vaccine structure, statistics appear logical when they show that paralytic \u201cPolio\u201d is increased both in incidence and fatality by use of the vaccine. One may compare various regions of different climatic conditions for the data. In all of these the Salk Vaccine was enthusiastically applied, in greater number each year, and the incidence increase was tremendous each year, whereas, if the vaccine were effective there should have been at least a little statistical improvement. In Montreal, generally cool, they reported on August 27, 1959, 521 cases with 27 deaths, just while the \u201cPolio\u201d season was getting well under way, as compared with less than one hundred in 1958. In Ottawa, generally cool, 455 cases with 41 deaths were reported on August 22, 1959, as compared with 64 cases with 7 deaths in 1958. In all of Canada, even before the epidemic started to decline, there were 7 times more paralytic cases in 1959 than in 1958, with a greater death rate. In Detroit, much warmer, where vaccination was thorough, the number of cases in 1958 was 697, against 226 in 1957. In the District of Columbia, still warmer, the Health Department reported 7 times as many cases in 1958 as in 1957. In New Jersey, in 1958, the Health Department reported twice as great an incidence as in 1957. The United States Public Health Service reported an increase of 15\u00bd% of paralytic cases in 1958 over those in 1957 (49% against 33.5%). In Hawaii (tropical) there were 65 victims including 32 paralytic cases in 1958; half of these paralyzed cases (16) had received three Salk shots, in an island where 60% had been vaccinated. In 1957 only 25 and 8/10ths % were paralytic instead of 49 and 9/l0ths% in 1958. If the vaccine were effective there should have been a 60% decrease in the incidence in the whole island of the paralytic infections, instead of an increase of nearly 100%.\n\nNationwide statistics issued January 4, 1960, by the United States Public Health Service, show that for the year 1959, up to December 26th (51 weeks), the increase in the incidence of Polio rose 85% over that of the same period of 1958. There were 8,531 cases listed for 1959, of which 5,661 were paralytic, as compared to 5,987 in 1958, of which 3,090 were paralytic. We just showed the great increase in 1958 over the incidence of the total and the paralytic cases of 1957. Where compulsory vaccination was practiced as in North Carolina and Tennessee, Bealle\u2019s investigations report a 400% increase in paralytic and non-paralytic Polio during 1959 over 1958. So it seems that the more vaccine that is used the more the actual infection that comes about. The statistical analysis teaches much about the nature of the virus.\n\nOf course, this is comprehensible when one considers that the virus breaks up into its component units on penetrating the host cell, as if by a de-polymeriza\u00adtion process, and it grows by acquiring new units to add to each, as by a co-polymerization process. Some investigators compare the viral structure to a deck of cards. The complete deck or complete virus with all its units is the parent pathogenic killer type. The vaccines may be regarded as incomplete decks, with not all the units required to make up the full killer type. Now, if a person carried vaccine units of, let us say, half or less than the killer type requires and another vaccination or infection by a crippled non-fatal virus comes along that presents the units missing in the protective infection or vaccination of a previous period either one of which alone can not produce the disease, the units all added up could constitute the complete killer type, and it has been shown that they are \u201cshuffled\u201d in at random to make up the full virus, vaccination may add to the incidence of serious or fatal infection, and the more the vaccination the more the chance for building fatal viruses.\n\nThis happened in the writer\u2019s early practice (1920). Two cases were vaccinated against smallpox from the same vaccine lot. One had no effect. The other came down with a rapidly fatal smallpox. There was no epidemic at hand in Detroit at the time, so it was concluded that the fatal case\u2019s inoculation carried units required by a previous silent infection to make it fatal.\n\nSMALLPOX\n\n Statistics on vaccination against Smallpox in the Philippines when the United States took over are instructive. Reports run thus: In 1918, the Army forced the vaccination of 3,285,376 natives when no epidemic was brewing, only the sporadic cases of the usual mild nature. Of the vaccinated persons, 47,369 came down with Smallpox, and of these 16,477 died. In 1919 the experiment was doubled. 7,670,252 natives were vaccinated. Of these 65,180 cases came down with Smallpox, and 44,408 died. One sees here that the fatality rate increased in the twice-vaccinated cases. In the first experiment, one-third died, and in the second, two-thirds of the infected ones died. This speaks for the retention of viral units from the previous vaccinations, and indicates that, in the vaccine the shuffling in of units varies in different specimens of vaccine. It should be stated also that every epidemic of viral disease treated by the writer followed vaccination within a few months, when protection should have been had instead of an epidemic. This was so in Brazil, in Aftosa, Cinemosa, Hog Cholera and Rabies, and in Cuba in Hog Cholera.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["By Doreen Miller", "Ken Adachi"], "publish_date": null}
