The suit was filed by a lawyer with Cornerstone Action, a Christian advocacy non-profit organization.\n\nThe school said that the student, who is being identified in court records by the initials M.P., violated a policy that says students have a right to be referred to using the name and pronoun of their choice and that those who do not recognize other students\u2019 chosen gender identities are violating the policy.\n\nThe student\u2019s lawsuit claims that the high school\u2019s policy infringes on his First Amendment rights. Although he has not denied violating the policy by stating his belief that there are only female and male genders, the legality of the policy itself is being called into question.\n\nThe suspension was based on an incident in which M.P. was talking to a friend on the bus about using plural pronouns when referring to people in Spanish, which uses feminine and masculine plurals. When a female student heard the discussion, she reportedly told M.P. that there are more than two genders, to which he replied, \u201cNo there isn\u2019t: There\u2019s only two genders.\u201d\n\nThis discussion was continued in a text message conversation that school administrators somehow obtained in printed form and presented to him when they issued his suspension. It is unclear why the other student, who is said not to be transgendered, felt the need to turn over a copy of the conversation to the school\u2019s vice principal.\n\nThe lawsuit states: \u201cHe in fact denied, and will continue to deny, that any person can belong to a gender other than that of \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt added that he \u201cwill never refer to any individual person using plural pronouns such as \u2018they,\u2019 using contrived pronouns such as \u2018ze,\u2019 or with any similar terminology that reflects values which (the student) does not share.\u201d\n\nMany parents have claimed that there is ideological bias among the school\u2019s leadership. Last month, it was put on notice by the state when the office of the Commissioner for the New Hampshire Department of Education and the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office issued a joint report on a series of concerns about the school involving violations of students\u2019 rights.\n\nAmong other problems, the school was found to have violated students\u2019 rights by putting marks on their hands at the prom to denote their vaccination status.\n\nBecause other school districts in New Hampshire have instituted similar policies regarding gender identity to those at Exeter High School, this case could have an impact throughout the state.\n\nA statement from Cornerstone said: \u201cThe key question before the court will be if Exeter\u2019s Gender Nonconforming Students policy, nearly identical to the policy adopted by school districts across the state, can be used to suppress the free speech rights of students who hold dissenting views.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that he did not demean or harass any student and was simply sharing his opinion.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the fact that the teen is a practicing Catholic has a lot to do with the school\u2019s unreasonable response to his statement of a biological fact. M.P. was exercising his right to free speech by affirming the church\u2019s teachings during a private conversation and should not have been punished for it.", "opengraph": {"title": "Student suspended for saying there are \u201conly two genders\u201d files lawsuit against school", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2021-11-21-student-suspended-two-genders-lawsuit-school.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "A New Hampshire teen has filed a lawsuit against his school district after he says he was suspended from sports for saying that only two genders exist.
