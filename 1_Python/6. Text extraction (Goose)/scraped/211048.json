In addition to cruciferous vegetables and fruits, the narrator explains that camel urine \u2013 and specifically that of virgin camels \u2013 is another potential remedy for dioxin exposure that, albeit nasty, could protect an exposed person against cancer.\n\nThe human gut is loaded with what are known as Ah receptors, which specifically interact with and are activated by the compounds in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables. Ah receptors are so unique in the types of molecules they attract that there have been many international scientific conferences devoted specifically to discussing them.\n\nThese conferences have shown that cruciferous vegetables help support a robust immune system by activating Ah receptors. These activated receptors protect not only against invading pathogens but also against the wide range of toxins we are all exposed to, including cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes, furnace gases, cooked meat and fish, dairy products, and even mother\u2019s milk because of what they themselves are exposed to \u2013 not to mention the latest chemical disaster to strike East Palestine.\n\n\u201cMany of these pollutants exert their toxic effects through the Ah receptor system,\u201d the narrator explains. \u201cFor example, dioxins invade the body mainly through the diet, more than 90 percent of exposure, as it concentrates through the food chain, presenting a serious health concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are phytonutrients in fruits, vegetables, tea, red wine, and beans that block the effects of dioxins at close to the kinds of levels you can find in people\u2019s bloodstream after eating fruits and vegetables.\u201d\n\nThe East Palestine disaster released untold levels of dioxins that will more than likely lead to cancer clusters in the years to come \u2013 at least among those who fail to adequately protect their bodies against dioxin exposure through diet. In addition to consuming more fruits and vegetables, the NutritionFacts.org narrator also explains how camel urine can get the job done.\n\n\u201cThere is actually one animal product that has also been shown to potentially block the cancer-causing effects of dioxins \u2013 camel urine,\u201d he says, citing a study on the matter. \u201cCamel urine, but not cow urine, was found to inhibit the effects of a known carcinogenic chemical.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportantly, the researchers emphasize, virgin camel urine showed the highest degree of inhibition, found better than pregnant camel urine, for example. So, the next time our kids don\u2019t want to eat their fruits and veggies, we can just say, \u2018Hey! It\u2019s either that or camel pee!\n\nIf camel urine doesn\u2019t appeal to you, try eating at least three apples per day\n\nIn order to benefit from the cancer-preventive benefits of apples, one would need to consume about three per day just to cut dioxin toxicity in half. The half-life of these phytonutrients is also only about 25 hours, so one would need to consume apples at regular intervals and \u201ckeep it up day after day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we eat enough, the intake from a plant-based diet should be enough to inhibit the cancer-causing effects of dioxins,\u201d the narrator explains.\n\n\u201cAt first, we just thought it was just cruciferous vegetables that were able to lock in these receptors and fend off toxins \u2026 but given the variety and flexibility of most mammalian diets, a specific dependence on cruciferous vegetables for optimal intestinal immune function would seem overly restrictive. Many other foods contain compounds with similar immune-stimulatory properties.\u201d\n\nBe sure to watch the video above to learn more about natural ways you can protect yourself against dioxin exposure.\n\nThe latest news about the East Palestine train wreck incident can be found at Disaster.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Camel urine found to block cancer-causing effects of dioxin exposure", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2023-02-20-camel-urine-blocks-cancer-causing-dioxin-exposure.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "Nine years ago, NutritionFacts.org put out a video report highlighting various natural compounds that block the cancer-causing effects of dioxin exposure inside the body.
