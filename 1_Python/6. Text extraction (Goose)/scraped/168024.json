In order for the machines who run the Matrix to maintain control, they impose what appears to be a perfect world for humans to keep them distracted, content, and submissive.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Neo\u2019s Matrix is not so far removed from our own technologically-hardwired worlds in which we\u2019re increasingly beholden to corporate giants such as Google for powering so much of our lives. As journalist Ben Thompson explains:\n\nEverything we do is increasingly dependent on and, ultimately, controlled by our internet-connected, electronic devices. For example, in 2007, there were an estimated 10 million sensor devices connecting human utilized electronic devices (cell phones, laptops, etc.) to the Internet. By 2013, it had increased to 3.5 billion. By 2030, it is estimated to reach 100 trillion.\n\nMuch, if not all, of our electronic devices will be connected to Google, a neural network that approximates a massive global brain.\n\nGoogle\u2019s resources, beyond anything the world has ever seen, includes the huge data sets that result from one billion people using Google every single day and the Google knowledge graph \u201cwhich consists of 800 million concepts and billions of relationships between them.\u201d\n\nThe end goal? The creation of a new \u201chuman\u201d species, so to speak, and the NSA, the Pentagon and the \u201cMatrix\u201d of surveillance agencies are part of the plan. As William Binney, one of the highest-level whistleblowers to ever emerge from the NSA, said, \u201cThe ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control.\u201d\n\nMind you, this isn\u2019t population control in the classic sense. It\u2019s more about controlling the population through singularity, a marriage of sorts between machine and human beings in which artificial intelligence and the human brain will merge to form a superhuman mind.\n\n\u201cGoogle will know the answer to your question before you have asked it,\u201d predicts transhumanist scientist Ray Kurzweil. \u201cIt will have read every email you\u2019ve ever written, every document, every idle thought you\u2019ve ever tapped into a search-engine box. It will know you better than your intimate partner does. Better, perhaps, than even yourself.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201csingularity\u201d\u2014that is, computers simulating human life itself\u2014was coined years ago by mathematical geniuses Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann. \u201cThe ever accelerating progress of technology,\u201d warned von Neumann, \u201cgives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to develop a computer network that will exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of human beings by 2029. And this goal is to have computers that will be \u201ca billion times more powerful than all of the human brains on earth.\u201d\n\nNeuralink, a brain-computer chip interface (BCI), paves the way for AI control of the human brain, at which point the disconnect between humans and AI-controlled computers will become blurred and human minds and computers will essentially become one and the same. \u201cIn the most severe scenario, hacking a Neuralink-like device could turn \u2018hosts\u2019 into programmable drone armies capable of doing anything their \u2018master\u2019 wanted,\u201d writes Jason Lau for Forbes.\n\nAdvances in neuroscience indicate that future behavior can be predicted based upon activity in certain portions of the brain, potentially creating a nightmare scenario in which government officials select certain segments of the population for more invasive surveillance or quarantine based solely upon their brain chemistry.\n\nCase in point: researchers at the Mind Research Center scanned the brains of thousands of prison inmates in order to track their brain chemistry and their behavior after release. In one experiment, researchers determined that inmates with lower levels of activity in the area of the brain associated with error processing allegedly had a higher likelihood of committing a crime within four years of being released from prison. While researchers have cautioned against using the results of their research as a method of predicting future crime, it will undoubtedly become a focus of study for government officials.\n\nThere\u2019s no limit to what can be accomplished\u2014for good or ill\u2014using brain-computer interfaces.\n\nResearchers at Duke University Medical Center have created a brain-to-brain interface between lab rats, which allows them to transfer information directly between brains. In one particular experiment, researchers trained a rat to perform a task where it would hit a lever when lit. The trained rat then had its brain connected to an untrained rat\u2019s brain via electrodes. The untrained rat was then able to learn the trained rat\u2019s behavior via electrical stimulation. This even worked over great distances using the Internet, with a lab rat in North Carolina guiding the actions of a lab rat in Brazil.\n\nClearly, we are rapidly moving into the \u201cposthuman era,\u201d one in which humans will become a new type of being. \u201cTechnological devices,\u201d writes journalist Marcelo Gleiser, \u201cwill be implanted in our heads and bodies, or used peripherally, like Google Glass, extending our senses and cognitive abilities.\u201d\n\nTranshumanism\u2014the fusing of machines and people\u2014is here to stay and will continue to grow.\n\nIn fact, as science and technology continue to advance, the ability to control humans will only increase. In 2014, for example, it was revealed that scientists have discovered how to deactivate that part of our brains that controls whether we are conscious or not. When researchers at George Washington University sent high frequency electrical signals to the claustrum\u2014that thin sheet of neurons running between the left and right sides of the brain\u2014their patients lost consciousness. Indeed, one patient started speaking more slowly until she became silent and still. When she regained consciousness, she had no memory of the event.\n\nAdd to this the fact that increasingly humans will be implanted with microchips for such benign purposes as tracking children or as medical devices to assist with our health. Such devices \u201cpoint to an uber-surveillance society that is Big Brother on the inside looking out,\u201d warns Dr. Katina Michael. \u201cGovernments or large corporations would have the ability to track people\u2019s actions and movements, categorize them into different socio-economic, political, racial, or consumer groups and ultimately even control them.\u201d\n\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, control is the issue.\n\nIn fact, Facebook and the Department of Defense are working to manipulate our behavior. In a 2012 study, Facebook tracked the emotional states of over 600,000 of its users. The goal of the study was to see if the emotions of users could be manipulated based upon whether they were fed positive or negative information in their news feeds. The conclusion of the study was that \u201cemotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness.\u201d\n\nAll of this indicates a new path forward for large corporations and government entities that want to achieve absolute social control. Instead of relying solely on marauding SWAT teams and full-fledged surveillance apparatuses, they will work to manipulate our emotions to keep us in lock step with the American police state.\n\nNow add this warp speed-deployed vaccine to that mix, with all of the associated unknown and fearsome possibilities for altering or controlling human epigenetics, and you start to see the perils inherent in blindly adopting emerging technologies without any restrictions in place to guard against technological tyranny and abuse.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for the starship Enterprise to boldly go where no man has gone before, but even Mr. Spock recognized the dangers of a world dominated by AI. \u201cComputers make excellent and efficient servants,\u201d he observed in \u201cThe Ultimate Computer\u201d episode of Star Trek, \u201cbut I have no wish to serve under them.\u201d\n\nConstitutional attorney and author John W.
