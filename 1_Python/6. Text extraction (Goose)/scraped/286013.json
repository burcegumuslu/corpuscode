This is substantial, considering far fewer people are getting sick or dying from the Chinese Virus itself.\n\n\u201cSeriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as \u2018serious\u2019 if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,\u201d the database explains about how injuries are measured.\n\nThe latest figures are much higher than earlier ones we reported on back in May, which reported about 10,000 deaths and 400,000 injuries.\n\nSo many people are getting injured or dying from Fauci Flu shots that reports indicate there is widespread vaccine regret across Europe and North America. People who lined up to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d through injection are saying they wish they would have listened to real scientists as opposed to television phonies like Tony Fauci.\n\nThere is also a trend of family doctors refusing to see their covid vaccine-injured patients because they do not know what to do for them. Such reports are coming out of both Scotland and England.\n\n\u201cMy vaccinated friends are not getting appointments with their family doctors who are avoiding them post vaccination even although there are no patients in the GP surgery waiting rooms when they have tried to get appointments,\u201d one person reported.\n\n\u201cIt is utterly cruel given they talked them into getting the vaccinations and accepted 10 U.K. pounds from the Scottish and English governments per person vaccinated on their patient list and did not disclose the risk of these vaccinations to the patients.\u201d\n\nDoctors now refusing to see vaccine-injured patients\n\nAnother person in Europe who was supposed to get a surgery was refused by her GP (general practitioner). Nurses also refused to take blood draws because they say they are not allowed to try to investigate what went wrong due to vaccination.\n\nIn another instance, a hospital consultant phoned a friend\u2019s GP requesting that she see a patient who reported getting a Pfizer injection and feeling like it was \u201cacid going into my veins.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://newstarget.com/author/ethanh", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-05-18-database-405250-covid-vaccine-injuries-10570-deaths.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
