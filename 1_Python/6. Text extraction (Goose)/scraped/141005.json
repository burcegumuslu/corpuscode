And it doesn\u2019t matter if these people claim to be doing so innocently, for the greater good, because that\u2019s what Nazis did as well,\u201d Green continued.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t justify marginalization, persecution, and apartheid \u2026 What we\u2019re seeing nowadays is precisely that,\u201d he added, alluding to the prohibition of those not vaccinated against COVID-19 from entry to public venues in many places during the peak of the COVID outbreak.\n\nTo highlight the historical parallel, he told the story of how a Jewish Holocaust survivor was invited to speak at an orthodox Jewish college and was eventually canceled \u201cbecause she could not show her vaccine papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they have become the modern-day purveyors of tyranny. Of persecution and marginalization of the minority,\u201d Green said.\n\nGreen suggested that such injustices can only take place when safety and security are elevated as the highest values of society. He argued that they must be subordinated to freedom, which is \u201ca value worth dying for.\u201d\n\nThe rabbi walks the walk in this regard. Green said that when his state governor decided that public worship was \u201cnot essential,\u201d \u201cI decided right then and there, [and] told my wife, \u2018We are not shutting the doors of our synagogue for one day.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife said, well, \u2018What if someone gets sick? What if we get sick and we die?\u2019\u201d\n\nGreen replied, \u201cWe have to be ready to die. We have to be ready to die before we allow the government to shut down our religious observances, our right to live and live freely \u2026 \u201d\n\nHear more eye-opening, stunning stories and reflections on the parallels between Nazi Germany and the COVID-era world, as well as little-discussed information on the five major companies that made the Holocaust\u2019s scale possible, by watching part one of Sharav\u2019s docuseries here.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-02-03 04:20:38", "title": "\u2018Never Again\u2019 documentary draws disturbing parallels between pre-Holocaust and COVID-era propaganda", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-02-03-never-again-documentary-disturbing-parallels-holocaust-covid.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "(LifeSiteNews) \u2014 A documentary film was published Monday on\u00a0Children\u2019s Health Defense\u00a0that draws disturbing parallels between the Nazis\u2019 propaganda push during the lead-up to the Holocaust, and today\u2019s psychological manipulation of the masses using the pretext of COVID-19.
