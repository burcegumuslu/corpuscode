This segment focuses on chemtrails, what they are, and how they are negatively impacting your health and the planet.\n\nHave you ever noticed lines of airplane residue remaining in the sky? Sometimes they are contrails, which is the result of jet engine vapors condensing into tiny ice particles at high altitude. But other times these chemical lines in the sky are what\u2019s known as chemtrails \u2013 a government-initiated chemical mixture allegedly put into effect to modify the weather and \u2018control global warming\u2018. Unfortunately, these chemtrails are wreaking havoc on both our food and your health.\n\nChemtrails are made up of numerous heavy metals, including nanoparticles of aluminum, barium, strontium, and sometimes ethylene dibromide or EDB, often called dibromoethane. EDB is a fuel additive banned by the EPA. These chemicals are released in the stratosphere and fall upon our crops and all living things, mixing with ozone along the way. When the aluminum nanoparticles mix with ozone, they turn into toxic aluminum oxide. This aluminum oxide, along with the other chemicals like barium, help to negatively impact the soil we grow our crops in.\n\nInterestingly, biotechnology giant Monsanto \u2013 a corporation responsible for creating genetically modified seeds, food, herbicides such as Roundup, and the infamous agent orange \u2013 is planning to release a genetically engineered seed that is resistant to aluminum and toxic metals. This brings into question the connection between aluminum and toxic metals in chemtrails and the profit-producing GE seed from Monsanto.\n\nAn Eerie Effect of a Recent Increase in Chemtrail Sprayings\n\nAs mentioned, these chemtrails are indeed negatively impacting both the food supply and your health. Dr. Group points out that, on the Monday before Thanksgiving of 2012, it was reported that the amount of chemtrail sprayings increased significantly. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the amount of negative reactions to these toxic clouds did as well.\n\nAbout two weeks after the Monday, Dr. Group and others saw an increase in people experiencing skin conditions such as ringworm-looking lesions and shingles. And as if this widespread felt reaction wasn\u2019t enough, Walgreens came out with a shingles vaccine campaign a few weeks after the outbreak. Again, this scenario raises serious questions, as a profit-producing rescue is made just after some people in power caused the initial problem. If this is the case, vaccine producers and other government officials are raking in tons of cash off of a problem they created themselves.\n\nGoing even deeper, Dr. Group notes that the flu shots created over the past 7-14 years contain GMOs that can be turned on or off. The flu shot 6-7 years ago contained particles of shingles. Now, when specific chemicals are sprayed in the air and are breathed in by those who received the shot, the shingles genes are \u201cturned on,\u201d leading the person exposed to develop shingles.\n\nOf course the dangers of chemtrails go far beyond those mentioned in this video. And while some people will call the information in this segment a conspiracy, there is indeed enough information circulating the internet to go deeper into this real issue.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Dangers of Chemtrails", "description": "In this video, Anthony Gucciardi speaks with\u00a0founder of Global Healing Center\u00a0Dr. Edward Group\u00a0III, DC, an expert of detoxification, classification of", "url": "https://tv.naturalsociety.com/the-dangers-of-chemtrails-dr-group/", "site_name": "NaturalSociety TV", "article:published_time": "2013-04-25T21:30:18+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-19T17:58:03+00:00", "image": "https://tv.naturalsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dangers-of-chemtrails.jpg", "image:width": "480", "image:height": "360", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["weather", "chemtrails", "crops", "shingles", "vaccine", "dr. group", "heavy metals", "contrails", "aluminum oxide", "aluminum"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/", "https://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/class/contrail.html", "https://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/class/contrail.html", "https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/environment/2011-02-25-geoengineering25_CV_N.htm", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,2-Dibromoethane", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082100", "https://www.monsanto.co.uk/news/ukshowlib.phtml?uid=14393", "https://naturalsociety.com/chemtrails-obvious-overhead-pollutant-ignored-denied/", "https://tv.naturalsociety.com/neurosurgeon-explains-detox-chemtrail-poisons/"], "authors": ["Mike Barrett"], "publish_date": "2013-04-25T21:30:18+00:00"}
