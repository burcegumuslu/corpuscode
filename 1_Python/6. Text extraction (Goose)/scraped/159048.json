The emergence of the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant among primarily unvaccinated people has exposed the cost of vaccine hesitancy. In this commentary, we explore factors contributing to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in pregnancy and potential solutions to overcome them.\n\u2022 Low COVID-19 vaccination coverage in pregnant people is a major public health problem in the United States.\n\nL.
