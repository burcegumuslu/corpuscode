Did she just get unlucky? Nope. She got vaccinated.\n\nYou will never, not in a million years, guess what is a known listed side effect of the Pfizer COVID vaccine?\n\nWe have proof that Pfizer knew about SPS in Feb 2021\n\nPfizer knew about this potential side effect likely before Celine Dion was vaccinated, but they have no duty to disclose that because hey, it\u2019s a safe and effective vaccine with only mild side effects. The FDA simply looks the other way for safety issues. That\u2019s the way science is done.\n\nPfizer knew about SPS in February 2021 and the FDA knew about it in April 2021. But the FDA isn\u2019t going to warn anyone about all these side effects because that would create vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThanks to Amy Kelly of dailyclout.io, we know that SPS was reported in Pfizer\u2019s postmarketing documents on page 37, which is also page 8 of Appendix 1. Being in this document indicates that Pfizer was aware of it no later than 2/28/21, and the FDA knew about it no later than April 2021.\n\nSo the FDA and Pfizer clearly know and told the public nothing. They aren\u2019t liable for any damages even if they didn\u2019t give anyone informed consent by revealing all the side effects.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Celine got the Pfizer vaccine or not, but the side effect profile of the other vaccines is even worse, so my arguments apply no matter what vaccine Celine got.\n\nVAERS data shows any post-vaccine diagnosis of SPS is 283X more likely caused by the vaccine than by \u201cbad luck\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s look at VAERS. Guess what? If you get SPS post-vax, there is a 99.6% chance it was from the vaccine.\n\nThe numbers for SPS over 30 years only implicate the COVID and HPV vaccines.\n\nSo for a \u201csafe\u201d vaccine like the flu vaccine (which I\u2019m not conceding is safe, but just for the sake of argument), we\u2019d get 1 report in 30 years (.03/yr). For COVID, we get 17 reports in 2 years (8.5/yr). So the relative rate increase is 8.5/.03 = 283.\n\nIn other words, math says that the chance that Celine Dion got SPS from the vaccine is 99.6%.\n\nIn short, it is almost certain that Celine Dion is vaccine injured.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! SPS can happen the SAME day as the COVID vaccine!!!!\n\nIf you think that\u2019s not causality, then explain the VAERS report below. It shows SPS can start IMMEDIATELY after vaccination. This is likely because it is causal, because the chance this would happen by \u201cbad luck\u201d is very small. Remember, there was just 1 report for the flu vaccine in 32 years. What do you think the chance is of a spontaneous SPS happening on the same day as a vaccination with the COVID vaccine? Very close to zero.\n\nHow do you explain this? It happened right after the shot, on the same day. Of course, this person could have been \u201cunlucky,\u201d but when you look at the other reports, they occur in close proximity to the vaccine.\n\nHere is the Reuters \u201cfact check\u201d for you to compare how THEY interpreted the VAERS data.\n\nWell\u2026. they didn\u2019t. Can you believe that? VAERS is the official US government adverse event reporting system that they spend $100M or more a year to maintain and the experts don\u2019t even look at it?!?!\n\nAccording to the experts contacted by Reuters, there is absolutely no evidence that the COVID vaccines cause SPS:\n\nWow. Contradicted by the evidence in plain sight. These experts cannot explain the data above. They don\u2019t even mention it. If they had mentioned it and gave a reason to dismiss it, I\u2019d listen to their reason. But to gaslight Reuters with false statements about data \u201cnot existing\u201d when it is in plain sight, that\u2019s downright unethical. Newsome should avoid commenting in areas where he lacks competency.\n\nReuters never contacted me on their fact check because THEY NEVER CONTACT ANYONE on our side to dispute their experts.\n\nSo these \u201cfact checks\u201d are ALWAYS one-sided (at least all the ones I\u2019ve ever read). Have you noticed that? They are propaganda pieces. They should be researching the evidence on both sides and then presenting a conclusion. Instead they only call experts who agree with the government narrative. That\u2019s NOT fact checking.\n\nOne other thing. The fact check said that SPS was an auto-immune disease:\n\nHello\u2026..!!!! There is GOBS of evidence COVID vaccines cause auto-immune diseases. How do you think the people died in the Schwab study for example? It\u2019s crystal clear. Those patients died because the immune system attacked their heart. That\u2019s called auto-immunity. I can\u2019t believe the \u201cexperts\u201d Reuters contacts are so brain-dead that they don\u2019t even understand the basics about the COVID vaccine. Willful blindness as Dr. Aseem Malhotra would say.\n\nThe COVID vaccines CAUSE SPS as well as hundreds of other severe adverse events which I documented LONG ago. There is simply no other way to explain the numbers in VAERS. Nobody will debate me on this.\n\nThe chances she got it from the vaccine is 99.6%.\n\nWill she go to a doctor who specializes in treating the vaccine injured? Nope. It\u2019s highly likely she was told it wasn\u2019t the vaccine by her doctor. Which means unfortunately, she will likely never recover since, in general, the sooner you are treated properly, the greater the chance of making a recovery. To get proper treatment, you need to see a doctor who understands the cause.\n\nWill Celine\u2019s doctors ever tell her about this article? Nope. What a shame.\n\nCeline Dion could be a powerful voice to warn people not to take the vaccine if she has the courage to speak the truth.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "Celine Dion was Disabled from a KNOWN SIDE EFFECT of the COVID Vaccine (99.6% certainty) | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "Stiff Person Syndrome that Celine Dion is suffering from is entirely due to the vax; Pfizer lists it as a possible side effect.", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/celine-dion-was-disabled-from-a-known-side-effect-of-the-covid-vaccine-99-6-certainty/", "article:published_time": "2022-12-16T10:16:49+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-16T10:16:49+00:00"}, "tags": ["Stiff Person Syndrome", "Pfizer", "Pam Barker", "Europe Reloaded", "Celine Dion", "Steve Kirsch"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/celine-dion-stiff-person-syndrome-symptoms-rcna60784", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/www.phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/reissue_5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?IDNUMBER=1462791", "https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-celine-syndrome/fact-check-following-celine-dions-diagnosis-experts-say-no-evidence-tying-covid-19-vaccines-to-stiff-person-syndrome-idUSL1N3331WP", "https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/stiff-person-syndrome/", "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00392-022-02129-5", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/the-vaers-x-factor-analysis", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/celine-dion-was-vaccinated-and-was?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=548354&post_id=90271062&isFreemail=true&utm_medium=email"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-12-16T10:16:49+00:00"}
