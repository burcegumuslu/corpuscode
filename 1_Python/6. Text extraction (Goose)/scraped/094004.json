The product is filtered to 0.2 microns particle size or smaller.\n\nHow C60 Blended With Olive Oil Benefits You\n\nC60 Olive Oil has the ability to increase longevity and prevent the dying of nerve cells. Through these effects, rats that participated in the study lived to almost double their natural lifespan.\n\nOther studies found similar effects in mice, with the animals living 8 days longer in their 120-day lifetime. In another study, researchers found the lifespan of mice increased between 5 and 14 percent. This was true even when doses of C60 were started halfway through the lifespan of the mice. (1, 2)\n\nFree radicals wreak havoc on the human body by reacting with almost any molecule and damaging it before moving on to other nearby molecules.\n\nThe result is increased signs of aging and the development of a variety of diseases.\n\nIn the modern world, free radicals attack the body from all sides. This includes air pollutants, cigarette smoke, pesticides and much, much more. Free radicals can even develop out of fried or processed foods.\n\nChanging your diet, however, can only help so much; often, free radicals are simply unavoidable; that's where C60 oil and its ability to demolish free radicals comes in. (3)\n\nAnother noteworthy benefit of C60 oil is its ability to prevent inflammation, making it a powerful potential aide for those suffering from arthritis or joint-related pain.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that C60 can prevent inflammation in arthritic rats. (4)\n\nAccording to one study, C60 \u2013 even in low concentrations \u2013 is able to annihilate the mosquito iridescent virus (MIV), proving its viability for combatting iridoviruses on the whole. (5)\n\nThe death of nerve cells is normal during the developmental process. However, sometimes nerves can be destroyed due to overworking as well. This poses a number of problems.\n\nThankfully, due to C60's antioxidant properties, it can protect your nerves from dying as a result of overworking. (6)\n\nUp next on C60's amazing list of benefits is its potential for preventing osteoarthritis.\n\nThankfully, C60 may be able to prevent the breakdown of cartilage associated with osteoarthritis. Further, C60 can also prevent bone inflammation, as seen in studies on rabbits. (7)\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (a cluster of symptoms that includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar and more), you have a greater risk of developing those dangerous conditions as well, even with the best of lifestyles.\n\nC60 may protect against metabolic syndrome while simultaneously preventing the growth of fat cells. (8)\n\nC60 oil doesn't just kill off mosquito-related viruses; it can kill off streptococcus bacteria as well, which can contribute to strep throat, skin infections and toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAccording to a study on mice by The American Society for Microbiology, C60 prevented death in 33% of mice infected with streptococcus bacteria. (9)\n\nFurther research suggests that C60's effectiveness in this regard could be even greater when combined with activated charcoal. (10)\n\nC60 also protects the skin from UV damage.\n\nAs a bonus, C60 blends well with skin lotions, making it super easy to incorporate into your healthcare regimen.
