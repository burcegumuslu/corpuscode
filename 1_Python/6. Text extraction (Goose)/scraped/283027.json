In fact, the WHO itself is the biggest promotor of anti-science rhetoric. \u2043 TN Editor\n\nThe World Health Organization shared a video on Twitter promoting the claim that anti-vaccine activism is deadlier than global terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and gun violence.\n\nThe video quoted Baylor College of Medicine\u2019s Dr. Peter Hotez, who stated, \u201cWe have to recognize that anti-vaccine activism, which I actually call anti-science aggression, has now become a major killing force globally.\u201d\n\nHotez went on to assert that 200,000 Americans died from COVID because they refused to get the vaccine, a claim that isn\u2019t backed up by any source.\n\n\u201cAnd now the anti-vaccine activism is expanding across the world, even into low and middle income countries,\u201d added Hotez.\n\nOnce again with providing any source for his dubious claims, Hotez asserted that \u201canti-science now kills more people than things like gun violence, global terrorism, nuclear proliferation or cyber attacks.\u201d\n\nThe doctor went on to complain about how anti-vaccine skepticism had now become a \u201cpolitical movement\u201d linked to \u201cfar-right extremism\u201d in both the United States and Germany.\n\nUnsurprisingly, respondents to the tweet completely savaged the WHO for sharing the video, with one pointing to stats that suggest, \u201cDoctors and \u201cmedicine\u201d kill more people than car accidents and guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest anti-science dissemination has come from the @who when you tried to shut the world down over a mild virus with a 99.97% survival rate and for which even the most dire mortality rate was fraudulently reported (ie \u2018positive test\u2019). You only have yourselves to blame,\u201d remarked another.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "WHO: Anti-Vaccine Activism Deadlier Than Global Terrorism", "description": "Anti-science aggression?
