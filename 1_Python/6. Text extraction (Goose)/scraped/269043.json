Whereas just 0.75 in every 2 children suffered some form of adverse event following any other type of vaccination.\n\nThis means the risk of children aged 5 and under suffering an adverse event is 36% higher following Covid-19 vaccination than it is following any other vaccination.\n\nIn regards to adverse events reported involving the pulmonary system, which includes airways, lungs and blood vessels, the results show that 1.43 in every 100 children suffered some form of illness of the pulmonary system following Covid-19 vaccination. Whereas just 0.47 in every 100 children suffered some form of illness of the pulmonary system following any other type of vaccination.\n\nThis means the risk of children aged 5 and under suffering illness of the pulmonary system is 204% higher following Covid-19 vaccination than it is following any other vaccination.\n\nThe results also show the exact same risk in relation to neurological disorders, which are illnesses of the brain and nerves.\n\nIn regards to adverse events reported involving cardiovascular disorders, which include illnesses affecting the heart and blood vessels, the results show that 0.38 in every 100 children suffered some form of cardiovascular disorder following Covid-19 vaccination. Whereas just 0.27 in every 100 children suffered a cardiovascular disorder following any other type of vaccination.\n\nThis means the risk of children aged 5 and under suffering a cardiovascular disorder is 41% higher following Covid-19 vaccination than it is following any other vaccination.\n\nThese are all serious adverse events of which the risk of suffering is significantly higher among children following Covid-19 vaccination. So the conclusion of the scientists the \u201csafety profile of the BNT162b2 vaccine is comparable to non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 vaccines \u201d is nothing short of an outright lie.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before we even take into account the number of children requiring emergency care of hospitalisation.\n\nAccording to the results of the study, 1 in every 99 children aged 5 and under required emergency care (ambulatory) or hospitalisation (inpatient) following Covid-19 vaccination. This compares to 0.46 in every 99 children requiring emergency care or hospitalisation following any other type of vaccination.\n\nThis means the risk of children requiring emergency care or hospitalisation is 117.4% higher following Covid-19 vaccination than it is following any other vaccination.\n\nTherefore, the scientists\u2019 conclusion of this study is not worth the paper it is written on. The actual conclusion should read \u2013\n\nThe problem is it doesn\u2019t, despite what the results prove, and we can guarantee the false and fraudulent conclusion of the study will be used to justify adding the Covid-19 vaccine to the mandatory childhood vaccine schedule in the USA.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://expose-news.com/2023/03/21/1-in-99-covid-vccinated-toddlers-require-emergency-care/", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797451", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797451", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797451", "https://expose-news.com/2023/03/21/1-in-99-covid-vccinated-toddlers-require-emergency-care/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 23, 2023"}
