Then he launched into a poignant, carefully crafted explanation that gently nudged and reminded objectors about why Rogan\u2019s show is a must-listen and a leader in the modern-day podcast gold rush.\n\nRogan requested that listeners disregard certain \u201cdisparaging\u201d headlines that he believes distort what he is doing on the show.\n\nHe notes that both physicians have excellent credentials and have opinions on SARS-CoV-2 and how to battle it that are \u201cdifferent\u201d from the dominant narrative on the virus.\n\nSome people, however, are afraid of what these two physicians have to say and assume that they are somehow directly responsible for the current COVID epidemic.\n\nThis is the problem: since the start of the pandemic, public health authorities have seen their guidance proven wrong again and again.\n\nRogan makes a similar assertion, arguing that almost every item of \u201cmisinformation\u201d has been shown to be right later on.\n\nHe continued: 8 months or a year ago, \u201c\u2026if you said \u2018I don\u2019t think cloth masks work\u2019 you would be banned from social media, now that\u2019s openly and repeatedly stated on CNN. If you said \u2018I think it\u2019s possible COVID may have come from a lab\u2019 you would be banned from many social media platforms \u2013 now it\u2019s on the cover of Newsweek.\u201d\n\nThroughout the video, Rogan maintained that he is not supporting the opinions of his guests, nor is he declaring them to be somehow accurate or immutable: he is merely examining a variety of perspectives in order to assist his audience in reaching their own conclusions.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta and Dr. Michael Osterholm (a member of President Biden\u2019s COVID advisory group), among others, were mentioned by Rogan as examples of how he is interested in hearing a varied variety of perspectives and viewpoints.\n\nAs for Neil Young, Rogan joked that he\u2019s \u201csure there are other things going on behind the scenes.\u201d For example, it\u2019s possible that Young is doing this to attempt to get a greater price for his lifetime music repertoire in advance of a sale of his estate (like Bob Dylan did).\n\nBut still, Rogan, on the other hand, asserted that he has always been a major Neil Young admirer, even relating a humorous tale about a Neil Young performance he attended while working concert security in his younger years.\n\nAs for the \u201cinterviews\u201d he conducts with his guests, \u201c\u2026they are just conversations\u2026often times I have no idea what I\u2019m going to talk about until I sit down\u2026that\u2019s also the appeal of the show, it\u2019s one of the things that makes it interesting.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the video, Rogan said this to sum up:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to promote misinformation, I\u2019m not trying to do anything controversial, I\u2019m just trying to have regular conversations with these people.\u201d \u201cMy pledge to you is that I will do my best to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people\u2019s perspectives so that we can maybe find a better view. I don\u2019t just want to just show the contrary opinion to what the prevailing narrative is. I want to show all kinds of opinions so that we can figure out what\u2019s going on \u2013 and not just about COVID, about health, about fitness, wellness, the state of the world itself.\n\nAnd finally, he even thanked \u201cthe haters\u201d for helping to keep him sharp.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Joe-Rogan.jpeg", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2022/01/thank-you-to-the-haters-joe-rogan-breaks-his-silence-on-spotify-controversy.html", "title": "\"Thank You To The Haters\": Joe Rogan Breaks His Silence On Spotify Controversy", "description": "Rogan apologized to those who he had unintentionally offended.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed", "article:section": "Opinion", "updated_time": "2023-01-12T10:57:27-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Joe-Rogan.jpeg", "image:width": "1303", "image:height": "733", "image:alt": "\u201cThank You To The Haters\u201d: Joe Rogan Breaks His Silence On Spotify Controversy", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2022-01-31T13:37:44-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-12T10:57:27-06:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/political/thank-you-haters-joe-rogan-breaks-silence-spotify-controversy-rejects-disinformation", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["The Mind Unleashed"], "publish_date": "2022-01-31T13:37:44-06:00"}
