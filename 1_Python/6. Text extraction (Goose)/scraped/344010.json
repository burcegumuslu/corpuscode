He wants to give livestock the mRNA vaccines that they forced upon us. But he\u2019s not the only one.\n\nThis specifically ties into an article Dr. Robert Malone wrote yesterday on his Substack. Animal mRNA vaccines are already here and have been since 2015. We know nothing about them. Drug companies aren\u2019t required to publish their trial data like human vaccines. The little information we do know often comes in the form of press releases, conference notes, \u201coccasional\u201d peer reviewed papers or another obscure way.\n\nIn fact, BioNTech (co-makers of the Pfizer vaccine) and Bayer have been working on mRNA vaccines for animals since 2016. Bayer, who secured exclusive rights to BioNTech\u2019s mRNA technology for animals, even produced the human COVID-19 vaccine in their facilities in Germany. This manufacturing facility was presumably intended to produce mRNA vaccines for animals.\n\nMerck is already selling their mRNA vaccine for pigs, \u201cSEQUIVITY.\u201d Merck Animal Heath promises a \u201crevolutionary swine vaccine platform\u201d that can \u201ccombat current and future swine diseases.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Star Chamber Justice", "The 5G Beast", "Neoliberals", "Battle Against Degeneracy", "Scamdemic", "Sub-Zero Kakistocracy", "Greenwashing", "(p)Harma Industry Skulduggery", "Faux Democracy & Voting Fraud", "9/11", "Astute Commentary", "True Crime", "Banksters / Financial Manipulations", "Muslim Demonization Agitprop", "Race Industry", "You Can't Make This Stuff Up", "Jewish Power & Influence", "Control of the Internet", "Cultural Marxism", "GMO & Toxins", "Suppressed & Hidden History", "Debt Slavery", "Brainwashing & Propaganda", "Neocons", "Identitarians", "Grand Solar Minimum / Cold Sun", "Threats to South African Whites", "Social Engineering", "Staged Deceptions & False Flags", "White Demonization Agitprop", "Migration as Weaponized War", "Transhumanist Scheming", "Media Lies & Fabrications", "Economic Statecraft", "Fight Club Memes & Tactics", "George Soros Skullduggery", "Israel & Zionism", "Suppression of Free Speech", "Globalization", "New Underworld Order", "Police State / Big Brother"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://drpanda.substack.com/p/bill-gates-animals-need-vaccines?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web", "https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/mrna-vaccines-in-livestock-and-companion", "https://www.genengnews.com/topics/drug-discovery/bayer-partners-with-biontech-to-develop-mrna-vaccines-drugs-for-animal-health/", "https://www.merck-animal-health-usa.com/species/swine/sequivity", "https://drpanda.substack.com/p/bill-gates-animals-need-vaccines?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2023/04/bill-gates-animals-need-vaccines/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2023%2F04%2Fbill-gates-animals-need-vaccines%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Ftorch-resize.png%3Ffit%3D32%252C96%26ssl%3D1&description=Bill%20Gates%3A%20Animals%20Need%20Vaccines", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Bill%20Gates%3A%20Animals%20Need%20Vaccines&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2023%2F04%2Fbill-gates-animals-need-vaccines%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2023/04/bill-gates-animals-need-vaccines/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2023/04/bill-gates-animals-need-vaccines/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
