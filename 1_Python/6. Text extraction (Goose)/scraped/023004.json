Event 201\u2019s backers also included the infamous World Economic Forum (WEF), which was conspic\u00aduously absent from direct involvement in the new exercise that was conducted at the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\u201cGrand Challenges,\u201d according to its website, \u201cis a family of initiatives fostering innovation to solve key global health and development problems. Each initiative is an experiment in the use of challenges to focus innovation on making an impact.\u201d\n\nStrikingly similar to the Event 201 exercise, this latest pandemic simulation devoted considerable time to fighting what the participants called medical \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Might this mean that another monopolistic \u201cvaccination\u201d push, hostile to even the most constructive criticism, and at war with alternative medical and nutritional modalities, is waiting to be declared amid lurid claims of millions potentially dying from another ambiguous pathogen?\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to know for sure, a two-minute official video summarizing Catastrophic Contagion\u2014whose 14 participants included vaccine-obsessed globalist Bill Gates\u2014reveals that organizers postulated that the new contagion would kill millions of people, most of them children, in order to scare the population to the highest possible degree. As one might expect, alternative voices are not to be tolerated, even while the World Health Organization (WHO), which would be at the helm of marshaling resources to fight the next \u201cpandemic,\u201d must be considered beyond reproach.\n\nA woman in the video, in the for-now fictional scenario presented in a news-like format, announces that the new pandemic, which is called Severe Epidemic Enterovirus Respiratory Syndrome 2025, or SEERS, caused \u201can estimated 1 billion cases worldwide and 20 million deaths, including nearly 15 million children; and countless millions are left alive but with paralysis and brain damage.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, an 800-word over\u00adview called Lessons from the Exercise discussing this latest drill states the commissars of medical monopolism expect additional informational resistance this time around:\n\nCountries should prioritize efforts to increase trust in government and public health; improve public health communication efforts; increase the resiliency of populations to misleading information; and reduce the spread of harmful misinformation. In the future, we should continue to expect even more major disruptions from misinformation and disinformation. The WHO can be a globally trusted source, and it can share science and public health information widely, but we should not expect it alone to combat or put a stop to the spread of this mis- and disinformation.\n\nThe overview envisions bringing the force of law against naysayers:\n\nMeanwhile, the WHO is working with various associated agencies to put together a World Pandemic Treaty, presumably by 2024. At this juncture, it\u2019s clearly conceivable, given the WHO\u2019s worldview of further centralization of medical authority, that such an extraordinarily fearful scenario like Catastrophic Contagion could be used as a catalyst to spook nations into accepting such a treaty \u201cjust to be safe\u201d and surrender a significant degree of national sovereignty\u2014meaning that individual nations\u2019 abilities to uphold medical choice could be turned asunder.\n\nBut what could upset the technocrats\u2019 far-reaching designs is the recent spate of often-dramatic adult and teen deaths\u2014including professional sports figures, sports journalists and scores of others\u2014who exhibit what the mass media cartel and governments label Sudden Adult Death Syndrome in an effort to dampen an increasingly likely uprising of people who are catching on that the experimental Covid jabs made by Pfizer, Moderna and other companies are possibly doing more harm than good.\n\nA new documentary under the banner of Dr. Joseph Mercola, called \u201cAnecdotals,\u201d chronicles the physical and emotional devastation and deaths that allegedly are resulting from the Covid shots, with many victims who\u2019ve been pro-vaccine all their lives simply asking that society not abandon them. This matter also has reached a near-zenith in the UK, with a London rally planned for Jan. 21 outside BBC headquarters and 10 Downing Street.\n\nThus, the Covid syndrome is at a serious crossroads. And the world may soon learn just how far the \u201ccovidocracy\u201d is willing to go to push their cocktails and alter governmental systems accordingly.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://americanfreepress.net/afpaudio/3_4_23_folder/08_3%264_23_Covid_Anderson.mp3", "https://americanfreepress.net/amember/signup", "https://www.beatirs.com/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/?s=Covid", "https://johnellis.com/", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
