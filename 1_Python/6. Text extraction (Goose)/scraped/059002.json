Also last year, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the U.K.\u2019s drug regulator, received more than 40,000 reports linked to reproductive and menstrual disorders that were suspected as adverse reactions to the vaccines.\n\nThe study, which is among the many documents that can be accessed on the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency website, was conducted on 21 female and 21 male Wistar rats.\n\nEach animal subject was given a single intramuscular dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Then, researchers tested rat blood and tissue samples to determine the content and concentration of total radioactivity in blood, plasma and tissues at pre-defined points after administration.\n\nThis means the scientists measured how much of the coronavirus vaccine spread to other parts of the animals\u2019 bodies, such as their skin, liver, spleen and heart.\n\nAccording to the results, the Pfizer vaccine accumulates in the ovaries over time. An ovary is one of a pair of female glands where eggs form and the female hormones estrogen and progesterone are made.\n\nWithin the first 15 minutes of vaccination, the scientists discovered that the total lipid concentration in the ovaries measured 0.104 ml. The figure then increased to 1.34 ml after one hour, 2.34 ml after four hours and 12.3 ml after 48 hours.\n\nThe research team didn\u2019t conduct further research on the accumulation after a period of 48 hours, so it remains to be seen if the alarming accumulation continued beyond that time frame. (Related: Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine causes miscarriages, stillbirths.)\n\nOfficial data from the U.K. published by Public Health Scotland contained some alarming clues hinting at the consequences of vaccine accumulation in the ovaries. It presents information concerning different topics like births and babies, child health, cancer, cardiovascular and mental health, injuries, pregnancy and substance use.\n\nIn September 2021, Dr. Victoria Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, published an article in the British Medical Journal about a possible link between menstrual changes and the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhile side effects like soreness in the arm, fever and fatigue are common in vaccinated individuals, others like changes to periods and unexpected vaginal bleeding hint at a potential connection that should be studied further.\n\nShe added that the effects of medical interventions on menstruation \u201cshould not be an afterthought in future research.\u201d Since clinical trials are the ideal setting for differentiating between menstrual changes caused by interventions from those that occur anyway, volunteers \u201care unlikely to report changes to periods unless specifically asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cInformation about menstrual cycles and other vaginal bleeding should be actively solicited in future clinical trials, including trials of COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d concluded Male.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to definitively conclude that coronavirus vaccines are the cause of an increase in cases of ovarian cancer, the data from Pfizer and the thousands of menstrual disorders being reported as adverse reactions to the injections suggest something worth investigating.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more information about the COVID-19 vaccine and its many adverse effects.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about a woman whose healthy aunt died after receiving the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThis video is from the Polyxena Lobkovice channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nReiner F\u00fcllmich and 50 lawyers: \u2018The vaccines are designed to kill and depopulate the planet.\u2019\n\nHighly vaccinated Israel has the most COVID-19 cases per capita IN THE WORLD.\n\nThe Ben Armstrong Show: Vaccines more dangerous than COVID \u2013 Brighteon.com.\n\nThe Big Logic: Dr. Peter McCullough talks about how COVID-19 vaccines can cause organ failure \u2013 Brighteon.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pfizer documents show COVID-19 vaccine accumulates in ovaries; UK data reveals cases of ovarian cancer in 2021 are at a record high", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cancer.news/2022-03-15-pfizer-covid-vaccine-causes-ovarian-cancer.html", "site_name": "Cancer News", "description": "A study\u00a0included in the first batch of Pfizer documents released on March 1 following a court order indicates that the company\u2019s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine accumulates in the ovaries over time.
