According to reports in the LA Times, some California hospitals look like \u201cwar zones\u201d with tents set up to treat influenza patients.\n\nThe news is hardly better elsewhere. In Kentucky, the death toll from the flu just topped 50. In Texas, where the epidemic has hit hardest, there have been 1,555 flu-related fatalities so far.\n\nIt\u2019s still weeks before the flu season is expected to peak, and probably months before epidemiologists know how many people will succumb to this outbreak, but already this season is shaping up as an especially vicious one.\n\u2022 None from Connecticut was as \u201chealthy as an ox\u201d before the flu killed him.\n\u2022 None A 27-year-old California woman \u201cwho never got sick\u201d died within days.\n\u2022 None from Pennsylvania passed away after flu-related organ failure and septic shock.\n\u2022 None A 12-year-old Michigan boy died despite being rushed to the . \u201cIt was too late,\u201d his mom explained, \u201cit\u2019s indescribable.\u201d She later added a warning for other parents, \u201cDon\u2019t wait, it\u2019s all I can say. This flu or whatever is going around this year is unbelievably dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn normal years, people over 65 are at the greatest risk for death and hospitalization, but this season the young and healthy are suffering severe complications and losing their lives too. How can the influenza virus be so deadly? Here are some things you need to know.\n\nOne hundred years ago \u2014 1918 to be precise \u2014 a flu pandemic swept the globe infecting about one-third of the world\u2019s population. As estimated 50 to 100 million people died as a result. Ever since, scientists have been trying to develop a universal vaccine. But today, even the most successful seasonal vaccinations are at best 60 percent effective in warding off the flu.\n\nThere are several reasons that flu vaccinations have not proven more efficacious. First, the viruses that cause influenza have demonstrated an uncanny ability to mutate and adapt to the natural environment, host defenses and human countermeasures. Second, public health officials do not always anticipate which flu strains will be the most active in a given season. As a result, the medical community is often playing catch-up. After all, vaccines typically take months to create, but by that time it\u2019s often too late.\n\nStill, health experts say that current flu vaccines should be about 30 percent effective in preventing the H3N2 strain, which is responsible for the infamous \u201cAussie flu.\u201d They also insist that the flu shot will lessen the severity of the flu if you do contract it.\n\nWhy is the flu proving so deadly? In fact, there are a number of ways that the flu can kill a person.\n\nAccording to Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior researcher at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, the flu virus can cause so much tissue damage, inflammation and fluid build up in a person\u2019s lungs that they can\u2019t metabolize oxygen. The result is a fatal form of respiratory failure caused by viral pneumonia.\n\nThe flu can exacerbate existing health conditions in vulnerable populations. This is why influenza has always been an acute danger to the young, older people, those with compromised immune systems and individuals with chronic conditions. For instance, when a person with a chronic illness is fighting off a viral infection they are more vulnerable to bacterial outbreaks and infections. Pneumonia can be caused by either the flu virus itself, or secondary bacterial infections. Either way, it\u2019s a life-threatening condition.\n\nThe influenza virus can trigger \u201cmultiple organ failure.\u201d As Dr. Andrew Pavia, chief of the division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City explains, \u201cThe flu virus grows primarily in your airways \u2014 your nose, trachea, the bronchi of your lungs, and, in some cases, deep down in the lung tissue.\u201d This results in an immune response that leads to significant inflammation. However, Dr. Pavia adds that \u201cThat inflammation, in part, sets off a cascade of chemicals going into your bloodstream.\u201d This activity can infect and damage one or more organs. When the inflammation and virus attack your heart it\u2019s called myocarditis.\n\nSometimes, the body\u2019s inflammatory response is so pervasive that it leads to an immediately life-threatening condition known as sepsis. This is caused by an immune system that gone into hyperdrive trying to fight off infections. As a result, inflammatory chemicals and bacterial agents traveling through the blood system can cause clots and rupture blood vessels. Infections can spread to multiple organs and blood pressure can drop precipitously. Unless sepsis is dealt with immediately the results are almost always fatal.\n\nThe flu can exacerbate existing medical conditions such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease and COPD. It can cause blood-glucose levels to fluctuate and lead to significant airway restrictions, which can result in life-threatening complications in individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHealth experts say the best way to prevent the flu is to practice good hygiene, avoid contact with sick people and stay hydrated.
