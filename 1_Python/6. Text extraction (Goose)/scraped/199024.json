Yesterday we reported about an alleged whistleblower with the U.S. CDC who is claiming that there have been at least 45,000 deaths reported within 3 days of receiving the injections, and that this information is being suppressed. And yet, most people around the world still seem to be completely ignorant regarding how many deaths following COVID-19 injections are actually being recorded by government health agencies, as the corporate media around the world for the most part is not allowed to cover these verifiable statistics showing unprecedented amounts of deaths and crippling injuries following these shots, all of which are still in the experimental phase and have not even completed Phase 3 trials yet. What we are witnessing is quite clearly a worldwide genocide and the implementation of a plan to reduce the world's population. Never before in modern, or even ancient history, have governments around the world acted in unison to force a medical procedure upon all their populations, and silence all dissenters who try to sound the warning alarm, which include tens of thousands of doctors and scientists. The European Union database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, and they are now reporting 18,928 fatalities, and 1,823,219 injuries, following COVID-19 injections.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["News", "Headline"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://medicalkidnap.com/2021/07/20/18928-dead-1-8-million-injured-50-serious-reported-in-european-unions-database-of-adverse-drug-reactions-for-covid-19-shots/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
