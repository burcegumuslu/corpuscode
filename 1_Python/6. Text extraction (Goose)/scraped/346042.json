So Rob Verkerk, the floor is yours for 10 minutes. Dr. Rob Verkerk: Perfect. Okay. So, um, Tess provided me with a copy of the report the minute it came through. It\u2019s obviously out there and what we want to do is just provide a little bit of, substance around what is going on because critically it is an interim report. And,as a scientist, I\u2019ve been involved in quite a few nano technological investigations for products ranging from,self assembling natural nanoparticles, bear in mind that happens every time we, interact [00:01:00] bile with our food, within our bodies. So self-assembly that a lot of people get very disturbed by it is a very natural process. And it occurs through electrostatic forces and, lipophilic and hydrophilic substances. and,we just wanted to get a measure of this. So just a little bit of,background, Galileo said all truths are easy to understand once they\u2019re discovered. The point is to discover them. Now, the reality is if you\u2019re looking for something that you already know is in a vial, it\u2019s a whole lot easier than trying to establish what\u2019s in there if you have absolutely no idea. So in many respects, this interim study has come from the perspective that there might be graphene in it. I said to Tess before, speaking about it, I wanted to speak with, one of the key scientists involved. This morning at a very early hour, Tess and I had a discussion, I continued that discussion for another hour. So I\u2019m confident that the things that we\u2019re [00:02:00] just going to talk about in summary terms,are pretty real. This is, basically a concoction of various pieces of data from an article I wrote, at the end of last year in December, \"What\u2019s in the Jabs that they\u2019re so desperate to give us\", and it reminds us because we\u2019re going to be looking specifically, at the two MRNA jabs and the non replicating viral vector, the AstraZeneca injection. Dr. Rob Verkerk: And you\u2019ll see if you just run across to the middle of the chart, you\u2019ll see that, in terms of the lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer and Moderna injections, you\u2019re looking at about 10 billion particles per dose, for the Pfizer, as you know, there\u2019s about three times the amount of MRNA in the Moderna. So that\u2019s about 40 billion, and when it comes to the adenoviral vectors, it\u2019s about 50 billion. So there\u2019s a huge amount of, supposedly active ingredient and carrier within that, on the extreme right, you\u2019ll [00:03:00] see the other ingredients, and,you know, the prime other ingredients for the MRNs or the other PEGylated lipid nanoparticles that deliver the products. And then you have, polysorbate, sucrose, a bunch of other things within the, AstraZeneca slide. That should be all you find in it. There were three pieces of data that, that emerged last year that would suggest, if you are scientifically minded and you care about humanity, you need to take this further. And that was the very reason that,Tess decided to commission a study. Pablo Campra\u2019s work, from Spain, was pretty critical. It used Raman spectroscopy that we\u2019re going to- very briefly, you\u2019ll see another group of scientists that came together that actually included Campra that, that couldn\u2019t disclose who they were. Any leading ISO accredited lab that does, that will instantly lose funding and those scientists will, see the careers pretty much [00:04:00] terminated. And then you\u2019ve also got the work we, we had on WCH professor on, Arne Burkhart, just a couple of weeks ago, who is one of the key German pathologist that was able to show some pretty strange, objects in,pathological examinations that have been carried out, that fitted the description of graphene. Dr. Rob Verkerk: So the, this particular unit study is done exclusively with Raman spectroscopy and associated microscopy. Very briefly. What you\u2019re doing is shining a laser via a mirror that splits the beam into the spectrometer. you have a, a detector within it. and, from that you, you get this scattering. Now, most objects that you strike with this laser, this split laser light will basically just return the same amount of energy from the photon in the light that submitted, that comes back to it. That\u2019s called Railey scattering that you\u2019ll see,in the two other diagrams, [00:05:00] but what happens in certain substance, substances, you get a very specific signature. For when the substance either absorbs some of that energy or loses some of that energy. So either it creates- basically you\u2019re looking at the vibrational state. We\u2019ve heard a lot about resonance and vibration as everything on this planet is resonating and vibrating. But what happens depending on the ramen shift, it was called after Raman and he was an Indian scientist that discovered it. You see the specific scattering, particularly the Stopes direction. That\u2019s another scientist that found that, that\u2019s a more common form. The other form is anti stokes. When the, the molecule that you are subjecting to light absorbs more energy. Has it been studied widely? Absolutely. It has the very characteristic bands that you can see in terms of, Raman scattering, the D band or the two D band. There\u2019s a reference here that we\u2019ll show you. [00:06:00] Graphene is a pretty new substance. It was discovered in 2004. It has very potent, electron transport properties. It really lends itself rather beautifully to nano electronic devices, that I\u2019ve been following some of the work that was being done, looking at behavioral changes in animals that were being carried out specifically with the purpose of mind control and that work has been published in major journals. Dr. Rob Verkerk: So the people who have, suggested there may be a link between 5G or 6G electronic devices and graphene are not barking up a conspiracy theory tree. There is genuine reason to be concerned about the linkage between those two things. It\u2019s also fantastically strong substance 200 times stronger than steel. It can be layered into, different layers. Raman spectroscopy is one way of determining those layers. Coming back to the UK, there has been a group [00:07:00] in Cambridge, headed by Andrea Ferrari that\u2019s done a lot of the work, in terms of characterizing, exactly what graphite- graphene is basically, very closely related to graphite. But it has this very various, these very specific, properties in terms of electron transport and use in nano technology. So let\u2019s go to the report itself. essentially in terms of the, supply chain, EBMC squared was able to obtain four vials of injection material. One Pfizer, two Moderna and one AstraZeneca. Dr. Rob Verkerk: They came specifically from areas. Many of you will know that the adverse reactions are often clustered in particular geographical locations. And these came from an area of the UK where there had been particular clusters of adverse events. That supply chain, as you will know, because it involves doctors who have to often [00:08:00] substitute, we heard from Dr. Hoffe about how this works, we\u2019ve also heard from Dr. Becker in our committee, how this happens, that they will, in order to maintain the Hippocratic oath, some- some homes substitute vials for saline in order to do no harm. So that supply chain is known, but again, just like the lab, it cannot be put into the public domain -That believe it or not is the scientist calling. Andthe key here was to establish, first of all, is the graphene within or graphite composites within these vials and actually they were fairly sure that they wouldn\u2019t be. So that was an interesting perspective to, to come from. There isn\u2019t a detailed quantitative analysis because it\u2019s an early interim study. But there was a vague quantification done by looking at a two centimeter transect for [00:09:00] all the samples. So you can see that there\u2019s a little or a lot of these, different, graphite related substances in it. so I\u2019m going to take you very quickly, you can obviously get a report and have a more detailed look. Dr. Rob Verkerk: Just remember when you look at these images that were only meant to be seeing in the case of Moderna lipid nanoparticles with this very fragile MRNA in it. Now immediately you start to see things that don\u2019t look like that should ring the alarm bells. In a normal situation- I\u2019ve been involved as a scientist in many food adulteration cases. And as soon as you see something like this, normally you can just knock on the door of the local, the national, medicines regulator, the MHRA in the UK, and go look what we found and they\u2019ll pick it up. And,and go after the company. In this case, we all believe that the system is too corrupt to be able to do that. But, you\u2019ll see, just from microscopy, you have a problem when [00:10:00] you start looking, at the spectra. Now you\u2019ll see, for example, in the top left, you\u2019ll see that very big peak. That aligns absolutely with the S with the spectrum that you would expect for graphene, but you\u2019ll see, it\u2019s pretty noisy, and it\u2019s very noisy because there\u2019s a bunch of things in there. Some of which are fluorescent, so they are reflecting, they\u2019re scattering more light, but it\u2019s very key that we\u2019re seeing that tall peak at exactly the spectrum that is expected for graphene composites. When you go to Pfizer again, you\u2019ll see, a whole range of ribbons, filaments, nano dots, all the things that were viewed as, generally conspiracy theories, and, they appear to be there. Dr. Rob Verkerk: Again they should not be there, exactly what they are, is defined here by some Raman spectroscopy. There are other ways of doing more detailed characterization and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been talking to the scientists about. [00:11:00] Once again, both in terms of counts, you\u2019ll see the,graph, graphene composites, in a two centimeter spectrum and they outnumber everything else. You\u2019ll see again, they have these signature peaks around graphene in them, same applies to the,AstraZeneca as well. So I just want to conclude by saying that, it\u2019s pretty clear that graphite composite forms as undeclared ingredients are very common in the vials. The ramen spectro we\u2019re not crystal clear because they were confounded by a lot of noise and fluorescence. What is visible through microscopy? It appears to be in the form of ribbon sheets, tubular forms, nano dots, and nano scrolls. And it is our view that further studies should be carried out on more detailed characterization of the forms. More quantification, more studies on function. Why are they there, obviously [00:12:00] on toxicology? And these are all things that are required. Even if you\u2019re going to be putting natural nanoparticulates into food. Here we have an undeclared adulterated drug that we can\u2019t knock on the door of the regulators with because they\u2019re in deep. And you\u2019ll see that there were a number of other spectra that were shown up that, suggests that other substances that are not declared on the label are also there. Dr. Rob Verkerk: Including Calcite so these are all minerals, and because it is Valentine\u2019s day and because I\u2019m working hard to keep to time. I just want to give you one final quote from Lao this is from 500 years before this guy Jesus roamed the planet saying being deeply loved by someone gives you strength while loving someone deeply gives you courage. And right now we all need loads of courage. Thank you.[00:13:00] Thank you very much, Rob. And, I think, suffice to say, I don\u2019t think we need to take questions on it, but just suffice to say that, there needs to be more investigation, into this, if only because,they are under undeclared, items in these vaccine vials. We will keep you abreast of, of developments with that as analyses are ongoing.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Covid-19 Injection Contents: Dr. Robert Verkerk Summarizes EbMCsquared CiC Study Preliminary Findings | World Council for Health", "description": "Dr. Rob Verkerk summarises the preliminary findings of an EbMCsquared CIC commissioned independent analysis of three types of Covid-19 vaccines.", "url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/multimedia/covid-19-vaccines-contents-prelim-summary-rob-verkerk/", "site_name": "World Council for Health", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WorldCouncilforHealth/", "updated_time": "2022-11-12T04:02:14+00:00", "image": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-02-14-General-Assembly-Dr.-Rob-Verkerk.jpeg", "image:secure_url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-02-14-General-Assembly-Dr.-Rob-Verkerk.jpeg", "image:width": "1120", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "EbMCsquared CiC", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "February 18, 2022 at 8:28 pm"}
