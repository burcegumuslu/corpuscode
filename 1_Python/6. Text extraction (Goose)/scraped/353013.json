They do not have enough information to rule it out given the known link between the vaccines and myocarditis and myocarditis and cardiac arrests,\u201d Rennick said.\n\nAs of March 6, the DAEN states that since the beginning of the vaccination rollout in Australia, 137,576 adverse events have been reported relating to the range of COVID-19 vaccines. Of those, 134,224 are believed to be directly related to the vaccines, while 980 are vaccine-related deaths.\n\nThe TGA does have a pre-existing independent review vehicle for vaccines called the Vaccine Safety Investigation Group (VSIG).\n\nThe group is meant to provide independent specialist immunisation (and other relevant) expertise to assist the TGA in investigating and managing Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) that require the services of national-level experts.\n\nThe group is described as a time-limited working group that can be convened when a single serious AEFI that is unexpected and without an obvious non-vaccine cause occurs. The TGA notes that an AEFI is considered unexpected when it is not listed in the product information document for the vaccine or is listed, but causality has not been established.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/omission-of-childrens-covid-19-vaccine-deaths-in-australia-raises-concerns_5071821.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/nurse-prepares-vaccines-700x420.jpg?itok=tF6OhwwA", "/s3/files/inline-images/20221121001732985680-original-min-600x400.jpg?itok=GHDbcpBk", "https://daen.tga.gov.au/medicines-search/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/omission-of-childrens-covid-19-vaccine-deaths-in-australia-raises-concerns_5071821.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
