Below we are delighted to run further information from their superb website.\n\nStanford professor John Ioannidis published an overview of Covid-19 antibody studies. According to his analysis, the lethality of Covid19 (IFR) is below 0.16{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} in most countries and regions. Ioannidis found an upper limit of 0.40{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} for three hotspots.\n\nIn its latest report, the US health authority CDC reduced the Covid19 lethality (IFR) to 0.26{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} (best estimate). Even this value may still be seen as an upper limit, since the CDC conservatively assumes 35{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} asymptomatic cases, while most studies indicate 50 to 80{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} asymptomatic cases.\n\nAt the end of May, however, Swiss immunologists led by Professor Onur Boyman published what is probably the most important study on Covid19 lethality to date. This preprint study comes to the conclusion that the usual antibody tests that measure antibodies in the blood (IgG and IgM) can recognize at most one fifth of all Covid19 infections.\n\nThe reason for this discrepancy is that in most people the new coronavirus is already neutralized by antibodies on the mucous membrane (IgA) or by cellular immunity (T-cells). In most of these cases, no symptoms or only mild symptoms develop.\n\nThis means that the new coronavirus is probably much more common than previously thought and the lethality per infection is up to five times lower than previously assumed. The real lethality could thus be well below 0.1{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} and hence in the range of strong seasonal influenza.\n\nIn fact, several studies have now shown that up to 60{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of all people already have a certain cellular immunity to Covid-19, which was acquired through contact with previous coronaviruses (common cold viruses). Children in particular often come into contact with such coronaviruses, which could help explain their insensitivity to Covid19.\n\nThe new Swiss study may also explain why antibody studies even in hotspots like New York or Madrid found infection rates of at most about 20{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117}, as this would correspond to an actual rate of nearly 100{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117}. In many regions, the actual prevalence might already be well over 50{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} and thus in the range of \u200b\u200bherd immunity.\n\nShould the Swiss study be confirmed, the assessment of Oxford epidemiologist Prof. Sunetra Gupta would apply, who predicted early on that Covid-19 is very widespread and its lethality below 0.1{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117}.\n\nDespite the comparatively low lethality of Covid-19 (deaths per infection), the mortality (deaths per population) can still be increased regionally and in the short term if the virus spreads rapidly and reaches high risk groups, especially patients in nursing homes, as indeed happened in several hotspots (see below).\n\nDue to its rather low lethality, Covid-19 falls at most into level 2 of the five-level pandemic plan developed by US health authorities. For this level, only the \u201cvoluntary isolation of sick people\u201d is to be applied, while further measures such as face masks, school closings, distance rules, contact tracing, vaccinations and lockdowns of entire societies are not recommended.\n\nRegarding contact tracing, a WHO study on influenza pandemics from 2019 also came to the conclusion that from a medical point of view this is \u201cunder no circumstances recommended\u201d, since it is not expedient for easily communicable and generally mild respiratory diseases.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that the rather low lethality was not known at the beginning of the pandemic. This is not entirely true, as data from South Korea, the cruise ships and even from Italy already showed in March that the risk to the general population is rather low.\n\nMany health authorities also knew this, as leaked emails from Denmark in mid-March show: \u201cThe Danish Health Authority continues to consider that Covid-19 cannot be described as a generally dangerous disease, as it does not have either a usually serious course or a high mortality rate.\u201d\n\nSome media nevertheless continue to calculate an allegedly much higher Covid19 lethality rate of sometimes over 1{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} by simply dividing deaths by \u201cinfections\u201d, without taking into account the age and risk distribution, which is absolutely crucial especially for Covid19.\n\nThe latest data from the European mortality monitoring Euromomo shows that several countries such as France, Italy and Spain are already entering a below-average mortality. The reason for this is that the average age of Covid19 deaths was very high and fewer people than usual are now dying in this age group.\n\nSee also: Studies on Covid-19 lethality\n\nNursing homes played an absolute key role in the Covid 19 pandemic. In most countries, one to two thirds of all Covid19 deaths occurred in nursing homes, and up to 80{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} in Canada and some US states. Even in Sweden, which did not impose a lockdown, 75{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of deaths occurred in nursing facilities.\n\nIt is all the more worrying that some authorities have obliged their nursing homes to admit Covid patients from the clinics, which has almost always resulted in numerous new infections and deaths. This happened in northern Italy, England and the heavily affected US states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt is also known from northern Italy that the widespread fear of the virus and the announced lockdown of the country led to the flight of the predominantly Eastern European nurses, which further accelerated the breakdown of elderly care.\n\nIn the United States, at least 42{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of all Covid19 deaths are accounted for by 0.6{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of the population living in nursing homes. Nursing homes require targeted protection and do not benefit from a general lockdown of society as a whole.\n\nIt is well known that even common corona viruses (cold viruses) can be very dangerous for people in nursing homes. Stanford professor John Ioannidis pointed out already in mid-March that coronaviruses may have a case mortality rate of up to 8{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} in nursing homes.\n\nIn addition, it is often not clear whether these people really died from Covid-19 or from weeks of stress and total isolation. For example, there were approximately 30,000 additional deaths in English nursing homes, but in only 10,000 cases, Covid19 is noted on the death certificate.\n\nIn April alone, around 10,000 additional dementia patients without corona infection died in England and Wales due to weeks of isolation. Investigations into the situation in nursing homes have been initiated or requested in several countries.\n\nThe second central factor regarding infections and deaths, in addition to the nursing homes, are the hospitals themselves. A case study in Wuhan already showed that around 41{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of hospitalized Covid patients had in fact contracted Covid in the hospital itself.\n\nContagion in hospitals also played a decisive role in northern Italy, Spain, England and other regions that were severely affected, meaning that the clinics themselves became the main place of transmission of Covid19 to already weakened people (so-called nosocomial infection) \u2013 an issue that had already been observed during the SARS outbreak from 2003.\n\nBased on current knowledge, those countries that managed to avoid outbreaks of infection in nursing homes and hospitals had comparatively few deaths. The general lockdown of society, however, played no role or even a counterproductive role (see below).\n\nAn additional factor is the sometimes fatal medical mistreatment of Covid patients with aggressive drugs or invasive ventilation, the risks of which experts have been warning about for months. In the US, for example, there have been questionable financial incentives to connect Covid patients to ventilators, a practice that is now being investigated in several states.\n\nSee also: An undercover nurse reporting from the \u2018epicenter\u2019 in New York City (Video)\n\nThe well-known Hamburg medical examiner Professor Klaus P\u00fcschel presented his study (English) on the first 12 of 190 detailed corona autopsies at a press conference (German).\n\nProfessor P\u00fcschel again emphasized that Covid-19 \u201cis not nearly as threatening as was initially suspected\u201d. The danger was \u201ctoo much influenced by media images\u201d. The media had focused on severe individual cases and fueled panic with \u201ccompletely wrong messages\u201d. Covid-19 is not a \u201ckiller virus\u201d and the call for new medicine or vaccines is \u201cdriven by fear, not facts.\u201d\n\nThe specific cause of death of the examined cases was pneumonia, but in about 50{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of the cases there were venous thrombosis in the legs, which can lead to fatal pulmonary embolism. The kidneys and heart muscle were also partially affected. Professor P\u00fcschel therefore recommends the preventive administration of blood-thinning medication for serious Covid cases.\n\nWith regard to thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, Professor P\u00fcschel \u2013 like other experts before \u2013 emphasized that a \u201clockdown\u201d with quarantine at home was \u201cexactly the wrong measure\u201d, since the lack of exercise itself promotes thrombosis. Indeed, US specialists have already been warning of this risk after even Covid-negative people developed unexpected thrombosis.\n\nMany media again misinterpreted the autopsy findings and spoke of Covid-19 as a particularly dangerous disease which, unlike influenza, is said to lead to thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This is not true, however: it has been known for 50 years that even severe influenza can greatly increase the risk of thrombosis and embolism and can affect the heart muscle and other organs. Even the recommendation regarding preventive blood thinner for severe influenza has been around for 50 years already.\n\nNumerous studies have now shown that children hardly get Covid19 and do not or hardly transmit the virus, which was already known from the 2003 SARS outbreak. There was therefore no medical reason for the closure of schools at any time.\n\nAccordingly, all those countries that reopened their schools in May saw no increase in cases of infection. Countries like Sweden, which never closed their primary schools anyway, had no problems with this either.\n\nA preprint study by the German virologist Christian Drosten argued that the risk of infection from children is comparable to adults and schools should therefore remain closed. However, several researchers demonstrated methodological errors in the study. Drosten subsequently withdrew the recommendation regarding school closures.\n\nIn some schools, for example in France and Israel, alleged \u201ccorona outbreaks\u201d are said to have occurred. However, it is likely that these are transmissions from teachers to schoolchildren that, to their dismay, are regularly tested, although they hardly show any symptoms and are themselves hardly or not at all contagious.\n\nThe British Kawasaki Disease Foundation again criticized the dubious and lurid media coverage of Kawasaki disease. In fact, there has been no significant increase in Kawasaki cases and no proven association with Covid-19. General inflammatory reactions in individual children are also known from other viral infections, but the number of cases reported so far is extremely low.\n\nGerman medical associations have also given the all-clear: Covid-19 is imperceptible or very mild in almost all children. Schools and daycare centers should therefore be opened immediately and without restrictions, ie there is no need for small groups, distance rules or masks.\n\nOn the effectiveness of masks\n\nRegardless of the comparatively low lethality of Covid19 in the general population (see above), there is still no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of masks in healthy and asymptomatic people in everyday life.\n\nA cross-country study by the University of East Anglia came to the conclusion that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection.\n\nTwo US professors and experts in respiratory and infection protection from the University of Illinois explain in an essay that respiratory masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). The widespread use of masks didn\u2019t prevent the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, either.\n\nA study from April 2020 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine came to the conclusion that neither fabric masks nor surgical masks can prevent the spread of the Covid19 virus by coughing.\n\nAn article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 also comes to the conclusion that respiratory masks offer little or no protection in everyday life. The call for a mask requirement is described as an \u201cirrational fear reflex\u201d.\n\nA May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the U.S. CDC also found that respirators had no effect.\n\nThe WHO moreover declared in June that truly \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d is in fact \u201cvery rare\u201d, as data from numerous countries showed. Some of the few confirmed cases were due to direct body contact, i.e. shaking hands or kissing.\n\nIn Austria, the mask requirement in retail and catering will be lifted again from mid-June. A mask requirement was never introduced in Sweden because it \u201cdoes not offer additional protection for the population\u201d, as the health authority explained.\n\nNumerous politicians, media people and police officers have already been caught putting on their respirators in a crowd especially for the television cameras or taking them off immediately when they believed that they were no longer being filmed.\n\nIn some cases there were brutal police attacks because a person allegedly \u201cdid not wear her mask properly\u201d. In other cases, people with a disability who cannot and do not have to wear a mask, are not allowed to enter department stores .\n\nDespite this evidence, a group called \u201cmasks4all\u201d, which was founded by a \u201cyoung leader\u201d of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos, is advocating worldwide mask requirements. Several governments and the WHO appear to be responding to this campaign.\n\nMany critics suspect that the masks are more likely to have a psychological or political function (\u201cmuzzle\u201d or \u201cvisible sign of obedience\u201d) and that wearing them frequently might even lead to additional health problems.\n\nA study from Germany empirically showed that the introduction of face masks had no effect on infection rates (see graph). Only the city of Jena appeared to experience a strong decrease in infections, but Jena simultaneously introduced very strict quarantine regulations.\n\nOn the origin of the virus\n\nIn mid-March, some researchers argued in a letter to the journal Nature Medicine that the Covid19 virus must be of natural origin and not \u201cfrom a laboratory\u201d. They cited the structure of the virus and the fact that the binding to the human ACE2 cell receptor did not correspond to the theoretical maximum.\n\nIn the meantime, however, numerous renowned virologists have contradicted this argument. An artificial origin in the context of virological functional research is \u201cat least as plausible\u201d as a natural origin. In fact, coronaviruses of this kind have been intensively researched in several laboratories for almost 20 years (i.e. since the SARS outbreak in 2003), they say.\n\nArguments in favour of an artificial origin include in particular that the binding to the human ACE2 cell receptor is significantly stronger than in all common source animals and that no direct source animal could be identified so far. In addition, the virus contains some striking functional gene sequences that might have been inserted artificially (see graphic below).\n\nThe initial theory of the animal market in Wuhan has since been rejected because none of the animals there tested positive and a third of the very first patients had no connection to the animal market. The animal market is now seen as a secondary place of transmission.\n\nIt is known that the virological laboratory in Wuhan, in collaboration with the United States and France, researched coronaviruses and thereby also generated \u201cpotentially pandemic pathogens\u201d (PPP) that are particularly easy to transmit and / or particularly dangerous. In addition, there have been several laboratory accidents with virus releases in China and the USA.\n\nThe unbiased observer must therefore continue to consider several realistic options: a natural origin of the virus (as assumed with SARS 2003), a laboratory accident as part of functional research (probably in Wuhan), or even a targeted release by a geopolitically interested actor in the East or West.\n\nNevertheless, the Covid19 virus is not a \u201cbiological weapon\u201d in the classic sense: the virus is very easily transmissible, but not particularly dangerous for the general population. Animal studies have shown that much more deadly corona viruses can be generated.\n\nVarious politicians in Europe and the US have declared that the \u201ccorona crisis\u201d can only be ended by a vaccine that is currently being developed.\n\nHowever, many experts have pointed out that an express vaccine against the new coronavirus is not necessary or useful due to the overall low lethality (see above) and the already declining spread. The protection of risk groups, especially in nursing homes, could be much more targeted.\n\nSome experts like the Swiss infectiologist Dr. Pietro Vernazza also pointed out that experience shows that the high-risk group in particular benefits the least from vaccination, since their immune system no longer reacts adequately to the vaccine.\n\nVarious experts have also pointed out the significant health risks of an express vaccine. In fact, vaccination against the so-called \u201cswine flu\u201d from 2009/2010, for example, led to sometimes severe neurological damage, particularly in children, and to claims for damages in the millions.\n\nNevertheless, several billion dollars of private and public funds have already been collected for the development of a vaccine. An \u201cimmunity certificate\u201d for work and travel is still being discussed. However, contrary to most media reports, the two leading vaccine projects had some serious complications.\n\nIn the case of the Oxford University vaccine, in animal experiments all six rhesus monkeys fell ill with Covid19 despite vaccination and were as infectious as the unvaccinated monkeys. Nevertheless, the vaccine was moved on to the human test phase. However, the project manager explained that the coronavirus had already become so rare in the population that the clinical trial may deliver no result.\n\nIn the case of the novel RNA vaccine from Moderna, which was unusually tested directly in human experiments, 20{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of the participants in the high-dose group had a \u201cserious side effect\u201d, although Moderna only allowed very healthy people to try it.\n\nOne of the Moderna participants was then presented and interviewed by CNN as a \u201chero\u201d. However, it was agreed not to mention that the participant passed out after the vaccination and became \u201cas sick as never before in his life\u201d. Several experts also criticized Moderna for not disclosing their clinical data sufficiently.\n\nThe director of the US Corona Vaccine Rapid Development Program was himself previously a director at Moderna. President Trump also announced that the vaccine might be distributed nationwide with the U.S. military. Some countries, such as Denmark, have already created the legal basis for mandatory vaccination of the entire population. In Germany, too, various politicians have spoken out in favor of compulsory vaccination.\n\nProponents of compulsory vaccination, such as World Medical President Frank Montgomery, argue that the population must be vaccinated to protect those who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons. In view of the rather low lethality of Covid19 and the already wide prevalence, this argumentation seems rahter questionable, however. In addition, there are the serious vaccine risks outlined above.\n\nNevertheless, the head of the largest European ticket portal Eventim said that \u201cmajor events may not return until there is a vaccine or a correspondingly effective medication.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who co-chaired the vaccine summit in early June with US billionaire Bill Gates, described the GAVI vaccine alliance as a kind of \u201chealth NATO\u201d. Nevertheless, \u201cimmunity passports\u201d are likely to fail since even antibody tests can only detect about 20{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of all infections, as the study by Professor Boyman\u2019s group has shown (see above).\n\nThe situation regarding helpful medication for severe Covid19 cases remains very unclear. The only consensus is that blood thinners are helpful in preventing life-threatening thrombosis and embolism (as with severe influenza).\n\nThere have been fierce discussions about the malaria drug hydroxychloroquin (HCQ) for months. The journal Lancet published a study at the end of May according to which HCQ leads to heart problems. The WHO then ceased all of its HCQ studies. Shortly thereafter, however, it became known that the Lancet study was based on a manipulated data set.\n\nThe Lancet study and another study in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) had to be withdrawn, which is one of the biggest medical scandals in recent years. The reason for the manipulated study is not clear, however, the lead author seems to be involved in a study of competing drug Remdesivir at the same time.\n\nThe use of remdesivir by the pharmaceutical company Gilead came itself under pressure after a first study showed that the drug could not reduce the risk of death. However, many media ignored this and still reported positive about the drug.\n\nA former French Minister of Health revealed in an interview that the editors of Lancet and NEJM stated in a confidential discussion panel that the pressure and influence of pharmaceutical companies had become so great, indeed \u201ccriminal\u201d, that one could no longer speak of science.\n\nVarious clinics use or study HCQ in Covid19 patients, sometimes in combination with zinc, vitamins or other medications. However, it is known that HCQ can lead to fatal complications in people from Africa and the Mediterranean region that have a metabolic pecularity called favism.\n\nUnfortunately, it must be assumed that incorrect or too aggressive medication with HCQ, steroids, antibiotics and antiviral agents as well as invasive ventilation has led to numerous additional and avoidable deaths during the corona pandemic.\n\u2022 The British chief medical officer Dr. Chris Whitty explained in a lecture that Covid19 posed \u201cno danger to the vast majority of the population\u201d. Most people do not or only mildly fall ill with it, and even with those who are seriously ill, the chances of recovery are good.\n\u2022 Stanford professor and Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Michael Levitt explains in a new article that the lockdowns did not save lives but cost many. A \u201cpanic virus\u201d has spread among politicians worldwide, professor Levitt said.\n\u2022 Professor Karel Sikora of the Note: The video with Professor Sikora was temporarily deleted by YouTube and only restored after protests). University of Buckingham argued in an interview that ultimately, fear will \u201ckill a lot more people than the virus,\u201d including untreated heart and cancer patients. Schools should be opened quickly and masks should remain an individual decision because their benefits have not been proven. One should go back to an \u201cold normal\u201d and not a \u201cnew normal\u201d. (: The video with Professor Sikora was temporarily deleted by YouTube and only restored after protests).\n\u2022 Professor Yoram Lass, former director-general of Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health, argues that the lockdown measures have been \u201ctotally disproportionate\u201d and are an acute threat to hundreds of millions of people. Covid19 is \u201ccomparable to a flu epidemic\u201d and would never have justified such political destruction of livelihoods. People have been intimidated and \u201cbrainwashed\u201d.\n\u2022 The Oxford professor of epidemiology, Sunetra Gupta, argues in a new interview that the lethality of Covid19 is likely to be below 0.1{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} and that a large number of people have already come into contact with the virus.\n\u2022 Leading German virologist Prof. Hendrik Streeck criticized the lockdown and explained that \u201call experts are returning to the assessment of the early days\u201d that Covid-19 \u201cshould not be trivialized, but also should not be dramatized\u201d. The reason for the declining risk assessment was the \u201cenormous number of infections that remained without symptoms\u201d. Streeck does not expect any excess mortality in Germany by the end of the year, as the average age of death is \u201crather above life expectancy\u201d, and he doesn\u2019t consider \u201ccorona apps\u201d and widespread corona tests to be useful. He also criticized the general use of masks, saying that these are a \u201cwonderful breeding ground for bacteria and fungi\u201d. Schools should be reopened as soon as possible.\n\u2022 An employee of the German Ministry of the Interior, responsible for disaster protection, together with external experts wrote a 100-page analysis paper on corona crisis management, which was leaked to the press at the beginning of May and created strong reactions. In the paper, Covid-19 is described as a \u201cglobal false alarm\u201d because \u201cthere was probably at no time a risk beyond the normal level\u201d for the general population. The collateral damage caused by the lockdown is now significantly higher than the recognizable benefit and far exceeds the risk potential of the corona virus. In March and April alone, over a million operations were not carried out in Germany. Crisis management and threat analysis mostly failed and data supplied by health authorities were \u201cinadequate\u201d as the basis for decision-making. The official was subsequently fired because he had created the paper \u201cwithout authorization\u201d.\n\u2022 A group led by Professor Sucharit Bhakdi founded the Association of Physicians and Scientists for Health, Freedom and Democracy (MWGFD), which has already been joined by over 16,000 supporters. At the beginning of June, the group published a call to the federal government and all state governments to immediately and completely lift the Corona measures. Professor Bhakdi\u2019s book, Corona: A False Alarm?, appearing at the end of June, is already an Amazon bestseller solely due to the pre-orders.\n\u2022 A senior physician for intensive medicine at the University Hospital Zurich, who cared for critical Covid 19 patients, criticized in a widely shared video the \u201cscaremongering\u201d associated with the disease. For the vast majority of all people there is no significant risk of death, the numbers are comparable overall to earlier flu waves. Risk groups could be protected in a targeted manner, while the lockdown only prevents the immunization of the general population. In addition, people die due to the medical undersupply in other areas. The medical and social damage has long been greater than the benefits. The partially mandatory mouth protection for schoolchildren also has \u201cno medical sense and benefit\u201d and places a heavy burden on the children. The \u201cdaily counting\u201d of the cases is nonsensical and only spreads fear. The counterproductive measures must be stopped quickly.Swiss media tried to put pressure on the Zurich University Hospital after the video had been widely distributed. The doctor has since removed the original video.\n\u2022 The Swiss chief physician for infectiology, Dr. Pietro Vernazza, using current case studies as an example, explains that fever measurements and contact tracing are not useful due to the often symptom-free course and easy transmission of Covid19.\n\u2022 The well-known Swiss immunologist Dr. Beda Stadler explains in an article that Covid19 is a \u201cvery selective disease\u201d and only poses a real risk for very few people. The media, on the other hand, focused on the few atypical individual cases that exist with every illness. Many scientists had focused too much on their models and too little on reality. The planned contact tracing is medically \u201csenseless\u201d and spreads \u201conly panic\u201d.\n\nSweden: Sweden had no lockdown, no mask requirement and no primary school closures, but instead mainly relied on the personal responsibility and cooperation of the population. This approach worked well and Sweden saw only a low mortality rate in the general population, comparable to a seasonal flu wave.\n\nNevertheless, the overall mortality rate in Sweden was indeed higher than in the neighboring Scandinavian countries or in Germany, which was portrayed by many international media as an alleged \u201cfailure of the Swedish no-lockdown strategy\u201d.\n\nHowever, most media didn\u2019t mention that three quarters of Swedish deaths occured in nursing facilities, which require targeted protection and do not benefit from a general lockdown of society. Indeed, at 86 years, the median age of Swedish Covid deaths is likely the highest in the world.\n\nThe Swedish government has also been one of the few to apologize for the insufficient protection of nursing patients and to announce an investigation, but this has again been portrayed by many media as an alleged \u201cfailure of the Swedish no-lockdown strategy\u201d.\n\nYet even total mortality in Sweden remained below the strongest seasonal flu waves of the past thirty years. Moreover, Sweden may now benefit from a very high natural immunity, especially in view of the latest immunological studies on the actual range of antibody tests (see above).\n\nFlorida: Despite being home to many senior citizens, Florida introduced rather few restrictions and even the popular beaches were reopened early, which was heavily criticized by many US media. Nevertheless, Florida did very well compared to other states and recently had around 2300 deaths in a population of 21 million, which corresponds to Germany\u2019s low mortality.\n\nIn an interview, the governor explained that contrary to the media, he realized early on based on the figures from South Korea and Italy that Covid19 was only dangerous for a very small risk group and he therefore protected the nursing homes as best as possible. In terms of prevention, nursing homes were even more important than the clinics themselves, and this strategy had proven itself. At the end of May, the governor announced that summer camps and youth activities could be carried out without restrictions.\n\nJapan: Japan registered some of the first Covid19 cases outside of China, but did not introduce a lockdown. At the end of March, the Japan Times asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the coronavirus explosion?\u201d Bloomberg now reports that a corona crisis never materialized: there were no restrictions on movement, restaurants and hairdressers remained open, there were no \u201ctracking apps\u201d and no mass tests of the general population. Nevertheless \u2013 or because of this \u2013 Japan now has by far the least deaths compared to the G7 industrialized countries.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that the respirators were decisive for Japan\u2019s success. However, respirators are voluntary in Japan and did not stop the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, while Sweden, Florida and other successful regions did not use masks in the general population.\n\nBelarus: Belarus has probably implemented the least restrictions of all industrialized nations and carried out even major events such as the 75-year celebrations of the end of World War II. Nevertheless, Belarus officially counts fewer than 300 Covid deaths even after more than three months. Long-term President Lukashenko, who has repeatedly referred to Corona as a \u201cpsychosis,\u201d said in mid-May that the capital, Minsk, had already passed the peak. The decision to treat Covid19 cases like normal pneumonia was correct. Ultimately, however, only statistics on overall mortality will be able to show whether the Belarusian numbers are really correct.\n\u2022 Transmission routes: A new report by the US health agency CDC comes to the conclusion that the virus is transmitted primarily through direct contact with people and \u201ccannot spread easily on surfaces.\u201d The German virologist Hendrik Streeck was already able to demonstrate that the new corona virus does not or hardly spread through objects or through aerosols floating in the air.\n\u2022 Distance rules: Iceland declared the distance rules optional at the end of May and reopened bars and clubs. Switzerland converted the distance regulations into a voluntary recommendation. A Cochrane study from 2011 already showed that there is so far hardly any evidence for the effectiveness of \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures.\n\u2022 Surgeries: According to an article in the British Journal of Surgery, around 28 million surgeries, including many cancer surgeries, have been canceled or postponed worldwide over 12 weeks due to corona measures.\n\u2022 Years of life: An evaluation by four US professors comes to the conclusion that the lockdown in the USA will cost about twice as many years of life as Covid-19 and was therefore a very counterproductive measure even from a purely medical point of view.\n\u2022 Coronavirus season: A new study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases shows that coronaviruses occur \u201csharply seasonal\u201d between December and April / May.\n\u2022 Virus test: A German mathematician explains why the low remaining infection numbers in many countries consist largely of false positive results, even with fairly accurate PCR tests, and the pandemic thus \u201cnever seems to end\u201d.\n\u2022 \u201cSecond wave\u201d: Studies on a \u201csecond wave\u201d sometimes make completely unrealistic assumptions, such as a constant risk of infection and death across all age groups. Nevertheless, the example of the 1968 Hong Kong flu shows that the global spread of pandemics can indeed extend over several seasons.\n\u2022 Italy: Almost 5{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of the population in Milan already had antibodies against Covid19 in mid-February, ie before the outbreak of the epidemic in Italy. This again indicates that the virus was already circulating in Europe earlier than previously thought.\n\u2022 Unemployment: The International Labor Agency ILO expects that due to the political corona measures, half of the world\u2019s employees or 1.6 billion people are at risk of losing their livelihoods.\n\u2022 Fact check: 13 misleading and false claims about the corona epidemic (German)\n\u2022 Review: Why life went on as normal during the global flu pandemics of 1968/1969 (Hong Kong flu, and the Woodstock music festival) and of 1957 (Asian flu).\n\nMany media reported on a study by Imperial College London, according to which the lockdowns in Europe allegedly \u201csaved 3 million lives\u201d. In reality, Imperial College London simply compared the unrealistic predictions of its own model with actual developments. This is particularly evident in the case of Sweden, which even without a lockdown had only a fraction of the deaths predicted by the Imperial College model (see graph).\n\nThe role of the media\n\nMost traditional media, almost all of which are part of elite geopolitical networks, decided to run a campaign of fear during the coronavirus period, a behavior that is usually observed in connection with wars of aggression or alleged terrorist attacks.\n\nThe risk to the general population was greatly exaggerated, official policies were hardly questioned, the situation in hospitals was dramatized, manipulative images were used, campaigns were staged, and protesters were systematically defamed as \u201cidiots\u201d.\n\nIt is true that some conservative media criticized the economically harmful lockdown measures. The real question, however, is whether they will also criticize the surveillance measures now planned, such as the extensive societal contact tracing (see below).\n\nMost independent media sooner or later realized that the risk of the corona virus was exaggerated and politically exploited. Only a few independent media outlets did not realize this, perhaps because they lacked a medical background or fell for the official campaign of fear.\n\nSome analysts compared Covid-19 to a psychological operation that uses the media-induced fear of the virus to bring about political and social change.\n\nUS platforms such as Google, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter censored corona issues extensively by deleting critical (i.e. non WHO compliant) points of view even from doctors or restricting their distribution, a procedure that has long been the norm for geopolitical issues.\n\nHowever, modern media users have the option of using manipulation-free search engines such as DuckDuckGo and independent video platforms such as Bitchute, as well as generally using an advertising and tracking blocker on certain media sites.\n\nThe above information may be accessed in many languages.
