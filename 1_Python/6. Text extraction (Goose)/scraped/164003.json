In a recent JP Morgan conference, CEO Jamie Dimon said that letting employees work from home did not work \u2018for those who want to hustle.\u2019\n\nBut for many people, it is a long-needed change they simply cannot give up on.\n\nNew generation employees are even dying to leave the office environment for good, with around 50% of them saying they\u2019d rather quit than give up on their flexible working conditions.\n\nOne of the main reasons listed for the need to work from home was cutting out travel times, but there\u2019s more. The survey found that generally, people estimated they could save around $5,000 each year by working from home.\n\nAnthony Klotz, a management professor at Texas A&M University said:\n\nWhat are your thoughts on working from home versus the workplace?
