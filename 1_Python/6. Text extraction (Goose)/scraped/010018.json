Try again. It obviously just means someone who decides they don't need to take a vaccine. The vast majority of them are fine; only a tiny number die, though they are disproportionately reported on in the media, for some strange reason. If people want to demonize a group for poor health choices, they should go after the \"anti-fitters\" who are obese, don't exercise, have unhealthy diets, stay inside all day playing video games, etc. But they pretend like covid is an equal threat to everyone, regardless of their lifestyle, and demonize even young, healthy people who are essentially at no risk from covid. Most \"anti-vaxxers\" are just reasonable people who can see that what is being promoted is unreasonable, don't think Big Government or Big Pharma has a right to mandate that they be injected with an experimental genetic cocktail or strip them of rights for not doing so, have confidence in their immune system's ability to protect them, reject the hysteria and authoritarianism, and just say no. That's all.\n\nWhen I hear the term \u2018anti-vaxxer\u2019 it\u2019s like I get a feeling that this is someone bad and that I should feel disassociated from them. I also get the feeling I shouldn\u2019t converse with them and should look down on them. \n\n I don\u2019t want to feel like that but this is what I\u2019ve been inundated with from the media, people in day to day life, at work etc. I think the term anti vax has been taken to an extreme and everyone has their own reasons for not taking it. I\u2019m becoming increasingly more and more annoyed by pro-vaxxers because I have to listen to them all day at work and they are becoming more and more neurotic, which is making me go insane.\n\nWhy do you make such silly comments? How is humanity going to go extinct from a virus that has greater than 99% survival rate, with or without vaccines? You don't sound very bright. That 99% survival rate might change to about a less than 10% survival rate if another much more horrific variant of the virus emerges that ends up being as deadly as the black plaque was if not much much worse. Besides, you\u2019re not understanding the bigger picture to all of this. Even if the human race does survive through this (it\u2019s still a big IF), all of those millions upon millions upon millions of those anti-vaxxers and so on and so forth throughout the whole world will still become a great liability for the next crisis that will undoubtedly emerge. It\u2019s simply because of how rotted their minds have gotten. What\u2019s even more sad about this is that even when those people pass away in the future their population will continue to increase given the fact that they will have more and more children. Look at how much the human population throughout the entire planet has increase exponentially decade by decade by decade by decade. That means that the amount of morons we are going to have in this world will undoubtedly continue skyrocket until the end of the time. Therefore, more and more future morons will continue the same toxic ideology that their parents had for generations to come. Then, those children will do the same with their children and so on and so forth. It\u2019s truly a very very sorry sight.?\n\nWhen I hear the term \u2018anti-vaxxer\u2019 it\u2019s like I get a feeling that this is someone bad and that I should feel disassociated from them.

If your media is encouraging you to hate a group of people, and your own feelings and experiences tell you they don't deserve it, what does that tell you about the media? They creating a lot of neurosis and insanity, clearly. If there is a harmful virus going around, it's the mind-virus of fear, spread by the media. The way to vaccinate yourself is to turn it off, and follow your own feelings and experiences. It's so simple, yet so difficult, because we let the media get so powerful.\n\nThat 99% survival rate might change to about a less than 10% survival rate if another much more horrific variant of the virus emerges that ends up being as deadly as the black plaque was if not much much worse.

All strains of covid have a very low fatality rate; speculating about non-existent highly lethal viruses is just fear-mongering. So is this idea that not taking vaccines is putting everyone at risk; these \"vaccines\" don't prevent you from getting covid or spreading it either; they aren't actually vaccines. Also, the world's birthrates are plummeting. Elon Musk considers depopulation one of the biggest threats to civilization. You are just making wild claims. Try thinking more critically and providing evidence.\n\nAll strains of covid have a very low fatality rate; speculating about non-existent highly lethal viruses is just fear-mongering.

Plus, he has undermined the trust and credibility of the real scientific and medical facts on COVID. Furthermore, he\u2019s kind of a libertarian douchebag. Also, the medical scientists have been saying that it\u2019s still possible that we could end up having a much more deadly variant than we\u2019ve ever had if we don\u2019t keep up our guard enough.",
