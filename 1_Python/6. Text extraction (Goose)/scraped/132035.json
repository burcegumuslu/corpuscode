The claim was that in a matter of just a few days, the \u201ccase\u201d rate for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) grew from 111.6 infected people per 100,000 to 160 people per 100,000.\n\nAs November progressed, that number grew to 209.2 cases per 100,000 people, only to jump at the end of the month to an all-time high of 223.3 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nThese erroneous figures, which we now know were basically manufactured out of thin air, were used as an excuse to legitimize a fresh wave of covid tyranny called \u201c2G.\u201d\n\nThat scheme involved requiring people to be either vaccinated or \u201crecovered\u201d from a \u201cpositive\u201d covid test in order to enter shops, eat at restaurants, or go to clubs. The unvaccinated were also told that they needed to avoid all social contact.\n\nHamburg Mayor Peter Tschentscher helped fuel the hysteria by claiming that only the \u201cvaccine\u201d would bring Germany out of the covid nightmare.\n\nNow, an investigation by the newspapers Sueddeutscher Zeitung and Welt found that the spike in cases touted by Lauterbach and Tschentscher was not actually real.\n\nHamburg\u2019s social services departments drastically skewed the numbers to create the illusion of another disease \u201cwave\u201d among the unvaccinated, when the reality is that these agencies did not even know at the time who was vaccinated and who was not.\n\n\u201cThis, however, did not stop them classifying everyone with an unknown status as unvaccinated,\u201d explains Wahagen Khabayan from The National Pulse. \u201cIndeed, by the end of November, a whopping 70 percent of the positive cases had unknown status.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Hamburg held a press conference the second week of November at which he incorrectly claimed that 90 percent of all new covid infections in the city were occurring in the unvaccinated.\n\nHe further lied about the seven-day infection averages for both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated, claiming they were 605 per 100,000 and 22 per 100,000, respectively. (Related: German government researchers are warning that the fully vaccinated are developing AIDS because of the jabs.)\n\nWelt later discovered that the erroneous methods used to calculate these false numbers were also being used throughout the entirety of Germany, making it appear as though there really is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.\n\nThe truth, of course, is that the world is now suffering through a pandemic of the vaccinated. Covid more than likely would have ended a long time ago had there never been any injections going into people\u2019s arms.\n\nThe chemical syringes filled with deadly spike proteins \u2013 or in the case of the mRNA shots, a GMO software template that instructs people\u2019s bodies to produce these spike proteins \u2013 are what continues to fuel the endless stream of illnesses and hospitalizations.\n\nIt was not until this past weekend that the truth about how these calculations were made went public. The Hamburg mayor now claims that the misclassifications were a result of \u201cdifferent IT systems,\u201d whatever that is supposed to mean.\n\n\u201cWith the situation in Hamburg \u2026 I can claim without a doubt that the problem was in the automatic classifier of the software,\u201d added Lauterbach, also trying to save face.\n\n\u201cThe problem is solved now \u2026 and it was a mistake and was not done on purpose in order to largely blame the unvaccinated for the pandemic.\u201d\n\nMore related news about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) lies can be found at Deception.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "German politician says oppressive covid measures for unvaccinated were based on \u201csoftware error\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2022-01-27-german-politician-oppressive-covid-measures-unvaccinated-software-error.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "After months of vilifying the non-jabbed and calling the current situation a \u201cpandemic of the unvaccinated,\u201d German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach is backing off and blaming his earlier statements on a \u201csoftware error.\u201d Back in November, corporate news outlets were reporting an increase in \u201cincident\u201d numbers throughout Hamburg.
