Most of these particulates are too small to be seen with the naked eye, though scientists were able to identify them using a colored, light-emitting dye.\n\nFor analysis, researchers also applied heat treatment, which allowed them to calculate an aggregate mass of the particulates in terms of volume and tonnage. (Related: The average person consumes a credit card\u2019s worth of microplastics every week in tainted food.)\n\n\u201cThe smaller the size ranges we looked at, the more microplastics we saw,\u201d said Joel Rindelaub, the study\u2019s lead author and a chemical scientist at The University of Auckland. \u201cThis is notable because the smallest sizes are the most toxicologically relevant.\u201d\n\nChances are you\u2019re inhaling microplastics right now and don\u2019t even know it\n\nThe smaller the size of a microplastic particulate, the easier time it has being inhaled and entering cells. If small enough, microplastics can even build up in vital organs such as the liver and cross the blood-brain barrier, accumulating in the brain.\n\nIn one square meter in one day in 2020, the average number of airborne plastics floating around Auckland was found to be 4,885. Comparatively for that same year in the same amount of space, London\u2019s count was just 771.\n\nA 2019 study that looked at the cities of Hamburg and Paris found that airborne plastics in that same one-square-meter space were 275 and 110, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe discrepancy is largely because of the Auckland study\u2019s inclusion of smaller size ranges, which were not part of previous research,\u201d noted Bloomberg.\n\nRindelaub says that while more work needs to be done to quantify precisely how much plastic the average person is breathing in, it is clear from what we already know that inhalation of microplastics \u201cis an important route of exposure\u201d that cannot be ignored.\n\nSince the 1950s when plastics first started being mass produced, some 8.3 billion metric tons of it have been generated. Of that, 79 percent has ended up in landfills or been dumped in the wild where it gradually breaks down and turns into microplastics.\n\n\u201cOnce they enter the natural environment, they can pollute soil, kill wildlife and find their way into the food chain,\u201d reports indicate.\n\nIn Auckland, the most-detected form of plastic was polyethylene, followed by polycarbonate. The former is a common packaging material while the latter is used in electrical and electronic appliances.\n\nSince Auckland is located near the ocean and gets heavy winds from the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, it is speculated that this could be a reason why more microplastics are being detected there compared to other more inland cities in other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cThe production of airborne microplastics from breaking waves could be a key part of the global transport of microplastics,\u201d Rindelaub explained. \u201cAnd it could help explain how some microplastics get into the atmosphere and are carried to remote places, like here in New Zealand.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s growing microplastics problem is much more serious than many people realize.
