If science wasn\u2019t plagued by corruption, an investigation should have started, healthcare agencies would have become involved and vaccine safety policies would have come under intense scrutiny, but that never happened.\n\nBelow is a recent interview with the two, done by Sur\u00eat\u00e9 Vaccins, the quick description of the video reads,\n\nNano particles are very small bits of matter, and they can enter into the human body, as the pair of scientist discovered in the 90\u2019s. This is why we have so much published research linking various chemical products, like cleaning agents, to the destruction of human health.\n\nThese nano particles are produced by waste incinerators, car traffic, and many other different ways. Because they float in the air, we can inhale them, which means they enter our lungs and then enter into the blood within minutes. This leads to a number of problems. These particles are carried by the blood to every district of the body, as they explain in the video below. When they enter into the tissues, the body cannot get rid of them, and so those particles stay there forever and are the cause of various diseases we see today.\n\nThey explain how they\u2019ve been analyzing and studying vaccines for the past 15 years.\n\nWhen all said and done, they analyzed 44 different vaccines. All of them contained these harmful particles, which are foreign bodies entering into the body. Whenever this happens, the body has a reaction, and it\u2019s not good.\n\nIn it, they talk a little bit about the study and what\u2019s currently going on.\n\nThis Is Simply The Truth About Modern Day Science That Continues To Be Ignored\n\nThere are three quotes I love to use to illustrate best what I\u2019m trying to get across here,\n\nIn the case of medicine, a lot of information has emerged showing just how much corruption really goes on in the industry. The Editors-in-Chiefs of several major medical journals have been quite blunt, with perhaps one of the best examples coming from Dr. Richard Horton, the current Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet, who says:\n\nDr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), also considered one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, alongside The Lancet, has said that:\n\nJohn Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine, published an article titled \u201cWhy Most Published Research Findings Are False,\u201d which subsequently became the most widely accessed article in the history of the Public Library of Science (PLoS). (source)\n\nHere is another great quote by Arnold Seymour Relman (1923-2014), Harvard professor of medicine and former Editor-in-Chief of The New England Medical Journal:\n\nIn 2016, a group of scientists in 2016 at the CDC named, SPIDER (Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics), put out a list of complaints in the form of a letter to the CDC\u2019s Chief of Staff, where they say,\n\nThis was covered by several activists, from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to another article from the Huffington Post, but unfortunately it received little to no mainstream media attention.\n\nShortly before this, and perhaps even more shockingly, is the whistleblower testimony from a senior CDC scientist, who has authored multiple commonly cited studies that show no link whatsoever between the MMR vaccine and autism. In fact, one of his studies, published in 2004, is the most commonly cited study used to debunk the link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nHis name is Dr. William Thompson, and he bravely told the world that it was \u201cthe lowest point\u201d in his career that he \u201cwent along with that paper.\u201d He said that the authors \u201cdidn\u2019t report significant findings\u201d and that he is \u201ccompletely ashamed\u201d of what he did, that he was \u201ccomplicit and went along with this, and that he regrets that he has \u201cbeen part of the problem.\u201d (source)(source)(source)\n\nHere is an official statement from Dr. Thompson describing the situation in his own words. This is perhaps the best source of information regrading this matter.\n\nThese are a few examples out out of many.\n\nWe are living in a time of great transparency, a lot of new information is coming out that\u2019s completely countering what we\u2019ve been told, and some rather ghastly examples of scientific fraud have been made, it\u2019s not just with vaccines.\n\nInformation like this, unfortunately, can create a divide among the population, with one side spewing venom at the other, using terms like \u201canti-vax\u201d or \u201cpro-vax.\u201d At the end of the day, these labels and the way we argue over them doesn\u2019t really solve anything. If all we do is react with emotions when it comes to such important topics, we might as well not even have a conversation about them at all.\n\nAll of us have to wake up and realize that nothing is set in stone, and the way we do things here is constantly changing. There is no denying the that fact that corporate/government funded media is severely fraudulent and basically presents one side of the coin.\n\nThe media pays absolutely no attention to vaccine research that does not fit the narrative of their owners. Something is seriously wrong here, and there are more than enough opportunities to see it.\n\nThe key here is to disseminate information in a peaceful manner, and remember, you still have the choice with regards to the decisions you make about your health, and the health of your child.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to think for yourself.\n\n\u201cThe main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don t sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so different from anything else in life\u2026 Virtually everything we know about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our doctors\u2026 the reason patients trust their medicine is that they extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines they prescribe. The patients don\u2019t realize that, although their doctors may know a lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know very, very little about drugs that\u2019ve been carefully concocted and dressed up by the drug industry\u2026 If you don t think the system is out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third leading cause of death\u2026 If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been caused by a new bacterium or a virus,or even one-hundredth of it, we would have done everything we could to get it under control.\u201d\n\n \u2013 Dr. Peter Gotzsche,
