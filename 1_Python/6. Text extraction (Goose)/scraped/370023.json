This virus strain was identified in December 2019. This disease has been declared as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Homeopathy for post Covid syndrome can be of great help in managing the lingering symptoms of the infection.\n\nIt spreads from person to person directly by inhaling the respiratory droplets released from an infected person via coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread indirectly if a person touches any surface that has been contaminated by this virus and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes without first washing and disinfecting the hands properly.\n\nThe symptoms of Covid -19 vary from mild to severe in intensity. The symptoms tend to appear between 2 \u2013 14 days after the virus exposure. The most common symptoms of Covid \u2013 19 includes fever, cough and fatigue (tiredness). Loss of smell and taste may be the early symptoms in many cases. Its other symptoms include difficulty in breathing, body aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat, runny nose or congested nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The elderly people and those already having certain health conditions (like diabetes, serious heart disease, lung disease, cancer, asthma and chronic kidney disease) are at high risk of developing severe symptoms and serious complications.\n\nThere is evidence that few people who suffered from Covid -19 may experience some long-term, debilitating symptoms that occur after having recovered from the acute infection.

As per a study it is estimated that around 87 % of patients after initial recovery from COVID still have one persistent symptom. Further among the various symptoms it is seen that about 60% of people after recovering from acute infection of Covid-19 still face complaints of persistent fatigue.
