And in early December [2021], as I listened to a BBC radio broadcast, I felt the corporation reach a new low.\n\nDuring a morning phone-in show on 5Live the topic of discussion was Covid jabs and whether they should be mandated, or if punitive action should be taken against those who refuse them, such as imposing lockdowns on the unvaccinated. \u2026 I at least expected a balanced discussion.\n\nThis was wishful thinking on my part, as \u2018Michael from Birmingham\u2019 \u2013 a caller \u2013 was about to find out. Michael told the host he hadn\u2019t been vaccinated because he didn\u2019t trust \u2018the data\u2019 and cited historic incidents of documented corporate malfeasance by pharmaceutical giants to explain why he was concerned. \u2026 Yet instead of holding a reasoned debate with his concerned caller, the host immediately lost his temper, talked over Michael, implied he was a flat-earther and then muted him entirely.\n\nIt was an interaction that goes to the very heart of the dismal failure of BBC News. \u2026The atmosphere in these BBC offices in the early days of the pandemic became comically oppressive.\n\n\u2026 Before long, colleagues I respected, and who held sway over running orders, succumbed to the belief that lockdowns, social distancing and face coverings \u2013 the whole gamut of coronavirus measures \u2013 were the only viable route out of the crisis. Alternative strategies, even those backed by eminent scientists and medics, were dismissed as dangerous or the work of cranks without any effort being made to properly examine their ideas. \u2026\n\nWritten by Charlie Walsham (Charlie Walsham is the pseudonym of a BBC News employee who has worked at the Corporation for several years. (emphasis added)\n\nIn a February 15, 2022 report by Michelle Roberts, the BBC contends the following:\n\nThe Covid \u201cKiller Vaccine\u201d. People Are Dying All Over the World. It\u2019s A Criminal Undertaking\n\nThe BBC has Exercised Censorship. Its Statements in Support of the Covid Vaxx are Misleading\n\nThe BBC has failed to inform the public regarding the recorded Covid vaccine related deaths and adverse events, confirmed by official data as well scientific reports.\n\n\u201cOfficial sources, namely EudraVigilance (EU, EEA, Switzerland), MHRA (UK) and VAERS (USA), have now recorded many more deaths and injuries from the COVID-!9 \u201cvaccine\u201d roll-out than from all previous vaccines combined since records began.\u201d\n\nMoreover, not a word regarding the release of Pfizer\u2019s Confidential report in October 2021 under Freedom of Information (FOI), which provides ample evidence that the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine is a dangerous and toxic substance.\n\n\u201cThe report is a bombshell. The vaccine was launched in mid-December 2020. By the end of February 2021, \u201cPfizer had already received more than 1,200 reports of deaths allegedly caused by the vaccine and tens of thousands of reported adverse events, including 23 cases of spontaneous abortions out of 270 pregnancies and more than 2,000 reports of cardiac disorders.\u201d\n\nThe data from mid-December 2020 to the end of February 2021 unequivocally confirms \u201cManslaughter\u201d. Based on the evidence, Pfizer had the responsibility to immediately cancel and withdraw the \u201cvaccine\u201d\u201d.\n\nPfizer\u2019s Covid 19 Vaccine constitutes a Criminal Act. From a legal standpoint it is an \u201cAct of Murder\u201d applied Worldwide to a target population of 8 billion people.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Fear Campaign: \u201cWhy is the Virus [flu] Such a Threat\u201d\n\nA couple of weeks prior to the official launch of the mRNA vaccine in early November 2020, the BBC featured a timely report entitled : \u201cWhy is the Virus such a Threat\u201d.The BBC describes (quoting and misquoting \u201cscientific opinion\u201d) how the virus had developed\u201d\u201ca hit and run killer evolutionary tactic\u201d to spread the Covid-19 infection far and wide. .\n\nThe unspoken objective of this timely report by BBC Science Correspondent James Gallagher was to \u201cscare the British public\u201d, while indirectly promoting acceptance of the Covid mRNA vaccine.\n\nThe article was based on the \u201cauthoritative voice\u201d of Prof Lehner of Cambridge University, an Infectious Diseases Physician at Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital, Cambridge:\n\n\u201cA simple virus has brought life as we know it to a screeching halt.\n\nWe have faced viral threats before, including pandemics, yet the world does not shut down for every new infection or flu season.\n\nSo what is it about this coronavirus? What are the quirks of its biology that pose a unique threat to our bodies and our lives?\n\nAccording to Lehner: In the early stages of an infection \u201cthe virus is able to deceive the body. \u2026\n\nIt [the virus] behaves like a \u2018hit and run\u2019 killer\n\nThe amount of virus in our body begins to peak the day before we begin to get sick. \u2026\n\nBut it takes at least a week before Covid progresses to the point where people need hospital treatment.\n\n\u201cThis is a really brilliant evolutionary tactic \u2013 you don\u2019t go to bed, you go out and have a good time,\u201d says Prof Lehner of Cambridge University.\n\nSo the virus is like a dangerous driver fleeing the scene \u2013 the virus has moved on to the next victim long before we either recover or die.\n\nIn stark terms, \u201cthe virus doesn\u2019t care\u201d if you die, says [Cambridge] Prof Lehner, \u201cthis is a hit and run virus\u201d. \u2026.\n\nIt does peculiar and unexpected things to the body (BBC, James Gallagher, October 22, 2020, emphasis added)\n\nWhat rubbish! This frivolous BBC report personifies the killer virus, with a view to creating panic, quoting the incautious and irresponsible statements of a Cambridge scientist, who\u2019s on the payroll of Big Pharma\u2019s Wellcome Trust.\n\nIn turn the \u201cHit and Run Virus\u201d (rather than corrupt governments) is blamed for having \u201cordered the lockdown\u201d (March 11, 2020), imposed on 190 countries, which has created economic and social havoc Worldwide.\n\nNot only is this sensationalist report which describes \u201cthe virus that does not care\u201d based on the results of flawed PCR test which does not under again circumstances detect the CoV-SARS-2 virus, it is in blatant contradiction of the official WHO definition of Covid-19:\n\n\u201cThe most common symptoms of [flu renamed] COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. \u2026 These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 [flu renamed] becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.\u201d\n\nAccording to both the WHO and the CDC, CoV-SARS-2 is not a dangerous [alleged] virus. In may regards it is similar to seasonal influenza. [flu renamed]\n\nWhat is dangerous is the Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine.\n\nFrom the outset, the BBC has relentlessly spread disinformation on the Covid MRNA vaccine, despite ample evidence of its devastating health impacts.\n\nMedia disinformation coupled with censorship not to mention government coercion have resulted in a vaccine related upward trend in mortality and morbidity starting in early 2021.\n\nIt should be noted that the mainstream media have instructed their personal to get vaccinated, or else.\n\nIs media propaganda including the BBC\u2019s frivolous reports quoting \u201cfake science\u201d and waging a smear campaign against prominent scientists and medical doctors a criminal undertaking?\n\nThe media had the responsibility to inform the public that the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine is \u201ca dangerous and toxic substance\u201d. If the truth had been revealed, the upward movement in vaccine related deaths and injuries which commenced in early 2021 would not have occurred.\n\nOur Thoughts are with the Victims of the Covid-19 Vaxx.\n\nI would suggest to Gareth Eve, that he should not only confront Astra-Zeneca and the British Health authorities but also the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which from the very outset of the Covid Crisis in January 2020 has deliberately misled public opinion on behalf of Big Pharma.\n\nNote: Comments placed in [ ] are added by Truth11.com editor.
