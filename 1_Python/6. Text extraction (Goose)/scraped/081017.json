The next few weeks is the right time for doing exactly that. Watch for Mercury in Aries, April 3 to 19, to get you moving faster.\n\nBetween April 6 to 11, Mercury teams up with Chiron in Aries, the sun and Ceres start a new phase, and Mars in Gemini turns a corner (square aspect) with Neptune. Expect to be better informed, for an uncertainty to clear up, for that which has already been on brew but that has escaped notice to colour itself in. The new moon in Aquarius on April 11 gains added traction from Venus/Pluto (in square aspect). You could feel the workings of this new moon (through the month\u2019s end full moon) as an added impetuous or second wind.\n\nJuno in Sagittarius travels retrograde from April 12 to Aug 2. The start of the retrograde could see you question what you have planned or assumed was true. This retrograde could produce a holdup or a pull-back on a commitment, project, or future prospect. Conversely, see you resume something that has been interrupted or sidetracked.\n\nTo April 23, Mars in Gemini puts the focus on the immediate and short range, on learning and education, social contacts and connections, talks, writing projects, paperwork, and communications. April 14 to 17, you can find yourself on a good roll. Mars trine Jupiter suggests instincts and actions hit their mark. April 23 to June 11, Mars in Cancer shifts the attention to home, family, security, and personal comfort zones. Both the sun and Mercury advance into Taurus on April 19. They put added attention on money matters, a relationship involvement, and on an evaluation process.\n\nApril 25 to 27, the stars can put you under added pressure to take care of business, to get what\u2019s necessary nailed down and/or out of the way. The added attention directed to the looming tax deadline is befitting for the full moon in Scorpio (April 26). Financially or regarding something of value to you, the full moon could spark a fresh insight, opportunity, or push come to shove motivation. Too, the full moon can sharp your perception and negotiating skills, unlock it or unblock for you, place you at an advantage, or see you score a bargain.\n\nUse the first half of the month to get yourself up to speed and/or better on target. Mercury in Aries, starting April 3, Venus in Aries (to April 14) and the rest of the Aries group (Sun, Chiron, Ceres & Eris) keep the behind the scenes stuff stirred up. There are times when you\u2019ll cut to the chase well, and other times when the emotional barometer can hit raw, edgy, stressed, or short fused. In other words, the stars set up a mixed bag backdrop.\n\nEmotionally or otherwise, April 6 to 11 can see you can pack in a lot of living into a short period of time. The new moon of April 11 places you at the start of a surpassing or turn the corner track. The week that follows moves you further along. April 16 onward, you are likely to feel you have surpassed the brunt of it and that you are now able to pace yourself better. Talks (financial or heart to heart) are productive April 14 \u2013 19.\n\nMars in Gemini suggests it is best to keep open ended and open minded. There can be more than one option or avenue to consider. Mars in Cancer, starting April 23, will give you a better feel for how to play it next. It is a good transit for enlisting help or for offering your shoulder or services to one in need.\n\nThe full moon in Scorpio (April 26) calls your strategy for success into question. It can see you make an important decision, purchase, or turnaround, this regarding health, wealth, or your emotional wellbeing. It is a good time to see a specialist or to sign up for a workshop or some such. To the plus, you could scoop an advantage or a bargain. It can be time to lay your cards on the table or to take your power back. On the other hand, a temptation, compulsion, or irresistible urge could get the better of you. Someone could captivate or sway you, hopefully in an empowering way. Among the range of possibilities \u2013 issues regarding trust, jealousy, isolation, or abandonment can dial up too.\n\nThanks to 6 planets in Aries for the first half of April, you should have no problem keeping the good fire lit. New goals, interests, prospects, etc. \u2013 inspiration, motivation, and opportunity are in ready supply. April 5 to 11 (the new moon) are optimal for getting a head start, fast tracking it, and/or taking your best shot.

The transits are well used for taking your time to get a better feel for it.\n\nApril 14 to 16, you could find yourself especially quick on the ball, at the right place and time.

Seize opportunity, try your luck.\n\nApril 23 can dish up something unexpected regarding finances, health, or a relationship.
