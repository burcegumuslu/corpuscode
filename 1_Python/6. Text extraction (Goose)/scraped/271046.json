This is not just with COVID, but is a problem consistent throughout history. One does not want to \u201cfix\u201d something with a solution now that raises more questions in the future.\n\nAn example of this has just been noted, and not in a concerning way, by CNN, in a report that as the first COVID vaccinations in the US are being given out, the Department of Defense with the CDC will be monitoring COVID vaccinations.\n\nThe Department of Defense released the first images of a Covid-19 vaccination record card and vaccination kits Wednesday. Vaccination cards will be used as the \u201csimplest\u201d way to keep track of Covid-19 shots, said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, which is supporting frontline workers who will administer Covid-19 vaccinations. \u201cEveryone will be issued a written card that they can put in their wallet that will tell them what they had and when their next dose is due,\u201d Moore said. \u201cLet\u2019s do the simple, easy thing first. Everyone\u2019s going to get that.\u201d Vaccination clinics will also be reporting to their state immunization registries what vaccine was given, so that, for example, an entity could run a query if it didn\u2019t know where a patient got a first dose. Moore said many places are planning to ask patients to voluntarily provide a cell phone number, so they can get a text message telling them when and where their next dose is scheduled to be administered. Every dose administered will be reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. The CDC did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s inquiry about whether such a database would include a record of everyone immunized. As far as vaccine kits, the DoD image shows the kits include a card, a needle and syringe, alcohol wipes and a mask. Operation Warp Speed has 100 million vaccine kits ready to go if and when distribution of a coronavirus vaccine starts, Gen. Gustave Perna, Warp Speed\u2019s chief operating officer, said last month. The images come as two companies \u2014 Pfizer and Moderna \u2014 await emergency use authorizations (EUA) in the United States. A panel with the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to discuss whether to authorize the EUAs on December 10 and 17. Should Pfizer and Moderna get the authorization, the vaccines\u2019 first shipments could happen December 15 and 22, respectively, according to a document from the federal government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed. Initial supplies in the United States will be limited, and the wider population won\u2019t have access to vaccines until months into 2021. A CDC panel recommended Tuesday that heath care and long-term care workers get inoculated first. By February, 100 million Americans could be vaccinated against coronavirus, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said Wednesday. The United States has said if both Pfizer and Moderna win FDA emergency use authorization in December, they could distribute 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of the month. Each vaccine requires two doses, so that\u2019s enough to fully vaccinate 20 million people. (source)\n\nNow I am not a \u201creactionary\u201d to vaccine issues, but as with all things, basic questions should provide clear and consistent answers. That is not unreasonable or much to expect. After all, would you eat something without knowing what it is if was new to you? In the same way, new things always require, for the observant man, simple question and simple answers.\n\nBut that is not what I am seeing here. Instead, I see questions, with no real way to explain the logic behind them.\n\nFor example, why is the DoD working with the CDC? This is a disease issue, not a military issue- or at least, it should be. It makes no sense that the DoD would have an interest in this save outside of vaccinating soldiers or military personnel.\n\nSecond, why are people being given \u201cvaccination cards\u201d to carry with them? People make jokes about \u201cyour papers please- Deine Papieren, bitte\u201d, but really, why does one need to carry a \u201cvaccine card\u201d in one\u2019s wallet? It seems very odd, and more than just a schedule. Indeed, there already exist registries in states for people who have AIDS, because of the fact that they carry a deadly disease, yet they do not have to carry \u201cidentification cards.\u201d This is not done for other incurable diseases such as HPV or Herpes, nor do other diseases get similar cards for shot regiments to be carried on one\u2019s person. So what makes COVID special? There is no answer to this.\n\nThird, and perhaps most concerning, why are vaccinations being reported to \u201cstate registries\u201d? Why does the state government need to know, for even with a pandemic, is it not enough just to speak to ones doctor? All files are on record- why does one need a COVID registry, especially considering how the pandemic, while it has killed many people, is nothing in comparison to other pandemics throughout history? Why do people who are \u2018vaccinated\u2019 need to be on this registry? Likewise, this \u201cregistry\u201d goes straight to the federal government. Why do they need to know which people in what state have it? One would think that getting COVID would, like AIDS, put one on a registry, but getting cured of it would take one off. Why, then, would people need to be put on a registry for getting the cure to a disease when they were not on one before? It does not make sense.\n\nFourth, what about people who don\u2019t get vaccinated? Are they going to be forced to get this vaccine, or will they have other options? Or will they be \u2018locked out\u2019 of \u2018access\u2019 to certain areas of society?\n\nThese are just four simple questions, with no good answers.\n\nThere is, however, a fifth reason that upon closer research, I have found, and it is something that mentions what people who are opposed to the vaccine have discussed, but it is an aspect I have never seen anybody discuss at all. In fact, I believe it is the most disturbing aspect of the whole vaccine, and yet, nobody has dared to answer it (check for a future article this month, before Christmas, about it).\n\nFor now, what we can say is that something does not seem right about this vaccine. Again, it is important to say that if a real vaccine exists that truly helps people, that is a good thing. However, no cure can ever come at a potentially higher price than what it claims to cure, and the more one looks into this \u2018vaccine\u2019, the more questions it raises that the vaccine is not so much about the disease, but has the signs of being a curious weaponization of biotechnology and science with militaristic and even financial ambitions coming together in one product with the pandemic as the excuse to impose it on the public.\n\nDonate now to help support the work of this site.
