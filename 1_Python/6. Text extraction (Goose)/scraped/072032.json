And he is not convinced that CO2 is anything about which to worry.\n\nHe says oceans are the \u201cvital inertial and thermal flywheels\u201d of the climate system. And the oceans, as we can clearly see, are not something that any person or government can control. (Related: Remember when Pete Buttigieg declared that carbon dioxide is a \u201csin\u201d in the eyes of God?)\n\n\u201cEfforts to decarbonize in the hope of affecting global temperatures will be in vain,\u201d Kininmonth is quoted as saying, adding that recent warming trends are \u201cprobably simply the result of fluctuations in the ever-changing ocean circulation.\u201d\n\nOcean movement is largely responsible for planetary warming, not cow farts\n\nKininmonth says it \u201cmust be recognized\u201d that CO2 is a non-issue when it comes to warming trends. Humans will always exhale CO2 and plants will always inhale it \u2013 and no amount of climate tampering will ever change that.\n\nHe further shared a chart showing that even as CO2 concentration increases from 0 to 600 parts per million (ppm), the total strength of the greenhouse effect barely changes, indicated by a nearly perfect horizontal line across all concentrations.\n\nIn essence, whether there is no CO2 in the air or tons of it, the greenhouse effect remains the same regardless. This basically deconstructs the entire global warming narrative with one simple data point.\n\nNo longer is it necessary to cull all cattle, destroy all gas-powered cars, and exterminate billions of people. Whether life continues on as normal or gets forced into a \u201cgreen\u201d transition, warming (and cooling) patterns will do what they are going to do regardless.\n\nGood luck trying to convince the climate crazies about any of this, but it is the truth just the same. And it is helpful to have someone like Kininmonth, a renowned climate expert, saying it along with the independent media.\n\nKininmonth says that heat is continually exchanged with the tropical atmosphere and transported by winds to enhance warming at the North Pole. The oceans are doing this, he says, despite it getting blamed on human activity.\n\nTemperatures at the South Pole, meanwhile, have barely moved at all over the past 50 years, which further supports Kininmonth\u2019s hypothesis \u2013 which makes a whole lot more sense, by the way, than the cow farts narrative coming from the left.\n\n\u201cModels fail to reproduce accurate energy flows, and this is the guts of how the climate system works,\u201d added Dr. John Christie, a professor of atmospheric and earth sciences at The University of Alabama, supporting Kininmonth\u2019s claims about ocean energy driving climate change.\n\nDespite all this, the prevailing climate claims still point to human use of fossil fuels as the driving factor in global warming. That is because those pushing these claims have a whole lot to gain from a forced global conversion to \u201cgreen\u201d energy.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a natural process primarily controlled by the cycles of the sun,\u201d added a commenter, pointing to yet another source of global warming that is outside of human control.\n\nThe climate insanity is only getting more and more insane.
