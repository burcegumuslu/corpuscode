In many cases, individuals who received the dengue vaccine and were subsequently infected with the dengue virus experienced more severe illness and an increased risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nSimilarly, ADE has been reported in individuals who received vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and HIV.\n\nOne example of a bacterial infection that could potentially be worsened by ADE or VAE is streptococcus A (strep A) infection. Strep A is a type of bacteria that can cause a wide range of illnesses, including sore throat, pneumonia, and sepsis. You will have most likely seen in the mainstream news that Strep A infection is killing children left, right and centre this winter.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination is the most likely reason for this, and the most important piece of evidence to support this fact is official Government reports that prove Covid-19 vaccination damages the immune system and has the potential to cause some new form of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\nIt is entirely possible that ADE and VAED can lead to immense immune system damage similar to that seen in acquired immune deficiency disorder (AIDS).\n\nIn individuals with AIDS, the immune system is severely compromised, making them more susceptible to infections and other diseases. Similarly, the occurrence of ADE or VAED can lead to damage to the immune system, potentially leading to a higher risk of infections and other diseases.\n\nIn addition to the risk of severe illness comparable to AIDS, ADE and VAED may also increase the risk of developing certain cancers. For example, some studies have suggested that ADE may increase the risk of developing certain types of lymphoma.\n\nThe occurrence of these adverse events has had devastating consequences for the individuals who develop them and confidential and official documents prove that ADE and VAED have occurred due to COVID-19 vaccines, leading to a new form of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and millions of excess deaths around the world.\n\nPfizer, the company hit with the largest healthcare fraud settlement and criminal fine to date in 2009; which also happens to be the same company behind the first ever mRNA gene therapy injection administered to the general public under emergency use authorisation in the name of Covid-19, has admitted in confidential documents, that it desperately tried to keep from going public, that its Covid-19 mRNA gene therapy may cause Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) attempted to delay the release of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine safety data for 75 years despite approving the injection after only 108 days of safety review on December 11th, 2020.", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pfizer.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pfizer.jpg", "image:width": "635", "image:height": "383", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/01/20/secret-pfizer-government-documents-confirm-millions-have-died-worldwide-as-ade-and-vaed-due-to-covid-fake-vaccination-sweeps-the-globe/", "description": "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED). are serious adverse events that can occur after vaccination.
