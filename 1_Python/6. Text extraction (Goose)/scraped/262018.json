Every time it rains, the runoff flows into surrounding streams, rivers and eventually into the ocean, where it kills fish.\n\nSmithfield hog farms are creating a \u201cdead zone\u201d off the coast of North Carolina that will soon rival Tyson\u2019s dead zone off the Gulf Coast, says North Carolina\u2019s Neuse Riverkeeper Katy Langly.\n\nAnd when hurricanes hit, the problem is magnified exponentially.\n\n\u201cAnimal waste is rich in nutrients,\u201d Langly told me in an interview. \u201cWhen applied to crops in appropriate amounts, it can be very good for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s over-applied, so the nutrients, along with fecal bacteria like e.coli, gets washed into our rivers.\u201d\n\nThe nutrients lead to algal blooms. \u201cThe algae explodes and then dies, depleting oxygen and suffocating the fish.\u201d\n\nLangly says the fish kills hurt tourism along North Carolina\u2019s coast. \u201cWhen people come to visit and there are a bunch of dead fish along the river, people don\u2019t want to come back.\u201d\n\nDuring Hurricane Floyd, in 1999, there were more than dead fish floating down the coastal River; there were dead pigs floating all the way out into the ocean.\n\n\u201cThousands of pigs drowned,\u201d Langly said. \u201cThere are pictures where you can barely see the roof of the barns. The entire lagoon had to be scooped out, and all of the waste held in it was dumped onto the surrounding area or washed into the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have 62 hog farms that still remain in our 100-year flood plain, along the Neuse River, which are always at risk of flooding anytime a major storm comes through.\u201d\n\nAnd with Florence projected to be the biggest storm in at least 30 years, it won\u2019t be pretty.\n\nLangly says there are technologies that can somewhat decrease the amount of pollution coming from factory farms, but they don\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cThe true solution is to \u2026 move back toward sustainable agriculture.\u201d\n\nRaising animals on grass, in fresh air and sunshine isn\u2019t subsidized by the government the way factory farming is, so pasture-raisedmeat costs a bit more, but for Langly the extra cost is worth it.\n\n\u201cYou can taste the difference,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind spending a little more for something that\u2019s been raised ethically and sustainably.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CAFO method for growing animals \u2014 it\u2019s not raising them \u2014 it\u2019s literally growing them \u2014 is just a conveyer belt away from being a true factory.\u201d\n\nLangly and her fellow riverkeepers at the environmental non-profit Sound Rivers advocate a \u201cswine buyout\u201d program, in which the state of North Carolina would buy hog farmers in the flood plain out of their contracts with and debts to Smithfield (i.e. set them free from indentured servitude) in exchange for promising never to use their land for industrial animal production again (small, pasture-based farms would be permissible).", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hurricane Will Likely Cover North Carolina in Hog Feces, As Manure \"Lagoons\" at Factory Farms Overflow", "description": "Smithfield\u2019s hog farmers are scrambling to drain thousands of toxic manure lagoons, some the size of lakes, before they overflow into drinking water and the growing \u201cdead zone\u201d off the North Carolina coast One of the little discussed horrors of factory farming are manure lagoons \u2014 giant cesspools of chemically-treated, bacteria-laden, liquid feces \u2014 built [\u2026]", "url": "https://returntonow.net/2018/09/13/nc-hurricane-manure-lagoons/", "site_name": "Return to Now", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/returntonow.net/", "article:published_time": "2018-09-13T01:10:07+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-09-15T12:30:56+00:00", "image": "https://returntonow.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/33.jpg", "image:width": "1624", "image:height": "866", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Rethinking Agriculture", "CAFO", "Hurricane Florence", "Factory Farming", "Manure Lagoon", "Uncategorized", "Smithfield", "Dead Zone"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "300", "height": "150", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayGJ1YSfDXs\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\ufeff</iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayGJ1YSfDXs"}], "links": ["https://waterkeeper.org/fields-of-filth-landmark-report-maps-feces-laden-hog-and-chicken-operations-in-north-carolina/", "https://civileats.com/2016/06/28/north-carolinas-cafos-produce-15000-olympic-size-pools-worth-of-waste/", "https://returntonow.net/2017/11/01/study-names-tyson-foods-1-culprit-largest-dead-zone-u-s-history/", "https://soundrivers.org/"], "authors": ["Sara Burrows"], "publish_date": "2018-09-13T01:10:07+00:00"}
