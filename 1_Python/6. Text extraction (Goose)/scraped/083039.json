A public health crisis\u2013 that was manufactured and gamed-out before the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China \u2013has been used to short-circuit long-held civil liberties, strengthen the authority of political leaders, collapse the economy, dramatically remake basic social relations, and impose absolute control over work, school, gatherings and recreational activities.\n\nPublic policy is now set by unelected technocrats who operate behind the cover of lofty-sounding organizations that are entirely controlled by the world\u2019s biggest corporations and richest oligarchs. President Dwight Eisenhower anticipated this troubling scenario 70 years ago when he said:\n\nBingo. This is the state of affairs in America today. All real power has been conceded to a globalist oligarchy that operates behind the curtain of corrupt government officials and public health experts.\n\nThis begs the question of whether the hoopla surrounding the Coronavirus emerged as a spontaneous and appropriate reaction to a lethal and fast-spreading pandemic or whether the hysteria has been greatly exaggerated (Infection Fatality Rate is 0.26% or 1 in 400) to implement a transformational political-social agenda that will not only eradicate democracy and basic human rights, but also pave the way for dangerous vaccines that will dramatically curtail population growth, which is an objective that is widely shared among wealthy elites.\n\nWould it surprise you to know that vaccines have been used in Africa, the Philippines, Nicaragua and Mexico to terminate fertility? Would it shock you to know that \u201cdo-goodie\u201d mandarins \u2013who want to save the world from overpopulation and global warming\u2013 have used toxic vaccines on unsuspecting young women who didn\u2019t realize that they were being used as lab rats in a malignant eugenics experiment?\n\nThis is from an article at Global Research:\n\nIt all sounds rather suspicious, doesn\u2019t it, especially since there was no tetanus crisis in Kenya to begin with. Kenya was merely the testing ground for vaccines aimed at achieving more diabolical goals. For example, why would a tetanus campaign only target women between the ages of 14 to 49 years old? Why did the campaign exclude young girls, boys and men who were equally susceptible to tetanus?\n\nYou know why. It\u2019s because the real objective had nothing to do with tetanus. Tetanus was merely the pretext that was used to conceal the activities of globalist elites working the kinks out of their depopulation strategy. Take a look at this press statement By the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops on the National Tetanus Vaccination Campaign:\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re thinking that they might have conducted these depopulation programs in Africa, but they\u2019d never do anything like that in the United States where our ever-vigilant media would expose what they were up to. Right?\n\nUnfortunately, the media is owned lock, stock and barrel by the same people who create crises to advance their own self-serving agenda. Covid-19 is probably no different in that regard.\n\nThe fact that the infection is modestly lethal actually helps to achieve the broader goal of reshaping society, restructuring the economy, abandoning representative government, and reducing the population to more sustainable levels.\n\nThese are the real objectives of this politically-driven farce. Check out this article in Bloomberg (2019) which helps to shed light on today\u2019s Covid developments. The article is aptly titled \u201cEarth Needs Fewer People, Scientists Say\u201d:\n\nFinally, there\u2019s this statement published in the journal BioScience by dozens of scientists and endorsed by further 11,000 from 153 nations.\n\nThe scientists say the urgent changes needed include ending population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating:\n\nThe fact is, there is a growing consensus among corporate leaders and other elites that we are facing a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d that will require immediate and draconian changes to our political, social and economic structures. Is it too far-fetched to think that Covid-19 was conjured up in order implement those changes without revealing the real reason?\n\nAfter all, the public is pretty evenly-split on climate change which means that the opposition would likely be organized, well-funded and ferocious. No doubt, that is something the oligarchs wanted to avoid altogether. A greatly-exaggerated global pandemic was the much better choice.\n\nWith the media already in tow, and enough sell-out public health experts and Democrat governors to do the heavy-lifting, the prospects for success must have looked quite promising. 8 months into the current operation, the checkered flag is now within sight..\n\nState governors remain unopposed in their usurping of special \u201ccrisis powers\u201d, Fauci and his ilk are still widely revered, masks are everywhere, rolling lockdowns and ever-tightening restrictions continue to be the order-of-the-day, and we are just weeks away from the icing on the cake, the thinning of the herd with a \u201cnanoparticle-based vaccine containing a synthetic chemical called polyethylene glycol or PEG\u201d.\n\nIn other words, the stealth sterilization exercises that were conducted in Africa were merely a dress-rehearsal for the main event, the summary injection of billions of people worldwide in an effort to significantly reduce global population. Are we there yet?\n\nNot yet, but soon.\n\nThe teams of psychologists who worked with governments (to sell the Covid terror) and who figured out that mundane reality must be turned on its head\u2013 through social distancing, masks, shelter-in-place orders, the closing of schools, businesses, public gatherings, and religious services\u2013 in order (to create a disorienting and terrifying environment) to usher in a new authoritarian system in which personal freedom extends no further than selecting one\u2019s online purchases from either Costco or Amazon.\n\nThese psychologists deserve much of the credit for the transformation of the western world into a lockdown police state ruled by scheming miscreants who will now decide our future for us.\n\nTHE VACCINE\u2013 The Culmination of 8 months of Relentless Disinformation and Hysteria\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear that the progress on the vaccines was deliberately delayed until after the presidential elections, (in order to hurt Trump\u2019s prospects for reelection.) very few realize the reason vaccines are being so quickly deployed. Simply put, the epidemic is rapidly winding down forcing the vaccine manufacturers to seek hasty approval so distribution can begin. This is a matter of great urgency which means the FDA will undoubtedly cave in to political pressure and approve prospective vaccines way before trials prove them to be safe. On Wednesday:\n\nNaturally, safety does not factor into the creation of a vaccine that normally requires 10 years to develop but is swiftly slapped together and brought to market in a mere 8 months. By definition, such a vaccine is not safe.\n\nWhy are these turkeys being rushed to market?\n\nAs we noted earlier, vaccine distribution is being rushed due to the fact that the pandemic is winding down, in fact, for all practical purposes, it\u2019s already over. In the US, the hospitalization and fatality data are being deliberately inflated to perpetuate the hysteria, (we\u2019ll explain this later) while in the UK, the fatalities attributable to Covid (in the fake \u201cSecond Wave\u201d) have never exceeded the 5-year average of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d, which is the barometer for deciding whether there is an unusual spike in mortality or not. There isn\u2019t.\n\nThe Second Wave does not exist. It is pure fabrication. Check out this blurb from Dr. Mike Yeadon, Pfizer\u2019s former Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy & Respiratory. Yeadon dismisses the \u201cSecond Wave\u201d theory as unscientific nonsense. Here\u2019s what he says:\n\n\u201cViruses don\u2019t do waves\u2026 I have repeatedly asked to see the trove of scientific papers used to predict a \u2018second wave\u2019 and to build a model to compute its likely size and timing. They have never been forthcoming. It\u2019s almost as if there is no such foundational literature\u2026 There have been no examples of multiple waves since and the most recent novel coronavirus with any real spread (SARS) performed one wave each in each geographical region affected. Why a model with a \u2018second wave\u2019 in it was even built, I cannot guess. \u2026 Despite the absence of any evidence for a \u2018second wave\u2019 \u2013 and the evidence of absence of waves for this class of respiratory virus \u2013 there was an across-the-board, multi-media platform campaign designed to plant the idea of a \u2018second wave\u2019 in the minds of everyone. This ran continually for many weeks. It was successful: a poll of GPs showed almost 86% of them stated that they expected a \u2018second wave\u2019 this winter. As research for this piece, I sought the earliest mention of a \u2018second wave\u2019. Profs Heneghan and Jefferson, on Apr 30th, noted that we were being warned to expect a \u2018second wave\u2019 and that the PM had, on Apr 27th, warned of a \u2018second wave\u2019. The Professors cautioned anyone making confident predictions of a \u2018second\u2019 and \u2018third wave\u2019 that the historical record doesn\u2019t provide support so to do. I looked for mentions by the BBC of a \u2018second wave\u2019.. On Mar 3rd and 6th, there is mention of a single SARS-CoV-2 wave with most (95%) of the impact early on. What looks to be the final document, Mar 29th, still just refers to one wave. This is what history and immunology teaches\u2026. Despite this bothersome oddity about a \u2018second wave\u2019 and almost as if there was a plan for one, the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing infrastructure in the UK began to be reshaped\u2026.the Portuguese high court determined two weeks ago that this PCR test is not a reliable way to determine the health status or infectiousness of citizens\u2026. With the scientific validity of this test under severe challenges, I believe it must immediately be withdrawn from use.\u201d (\u201cThe PCR False Positive Pseudo-Epidemic\u201c, Lockdown Skeptics)\n\nNope, it\u2019s 100% bunkum. But \u201cthere was a plan for one\u201d, which is to say, there was a plan for amplifying the panic to achieve the objectives of elites. That\u2019s clear.\n\nYeadon then explains how the PCR tests were removed from NHS (National Health Service) labs and delivered to privately-owned \u201cmass testing centers\u201d that replaced \u201chighly qualified and experienced Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) registered biomedical scientists\u201d with \u201d mainly by volunteer unregistered staff in unaccredited laboratories that have been established within a few weeks.\u201d\n\nNaturally, this threw into question the overall reliability of their test results which, in turn, produced massive numbers of false positives that in no way reflected the diminishing impact of the virus.\n\nAs Yeadon\u2019s states: such mass testing brings with it, when using PCR as the method, a severe risk of what we call a \u201cPCR false positive pseudo-epidemic\u201d. This could never happen if we were not using PCR mass testing. When a more reliable test was used in Liverpool (Lateral-flow test or LFT) showing that a smaller percentage of people were infected, the test was discarded in favor of the PCR test.\n\n\u201cBy September, the great bulk of PCR testing was being run by large, private labs, some of which are called Lighthouse Labs.\u201d That is when the number of infections began to spike sharply which was completely inconsistent with the behavior of epidemics in the past.\n\nThat\u2019s easy. The whole charade was rigged to make PCR false positives look like a real epidemic. Keep in mind, this isn\u2019t my unprofessional observation, but Pfizer\u2019s former Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy & Respiratory.\n\nAnd just look at the extent to which this farce was maintained. Here\u2019s Yeadon explaining how definitions are stretched to the breaking point to exaggerate the number of Covid fatalities:\n\nSo, let\u2019s say you have a massive heart attack and die, but a PCR test shows you have harmless RNA fragments in your bloodstream, then the death is labeled \u201cCovid\u201d. Got that? Yeadon summarizes this hanky-panky in one terse sentence:\n\n\u201cWe have very strong evidence that the PCR mass testing as currently conducted is completely worthless.\u201d (Yeadon and a panel of experts have since submitted a 10-point paper to the Eurosurveillance editorial board challenging the science upon which the PCR test is based \u201cwhich has led to worldwide misdiagnosis of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and associated with the disease COVID-19.\n\nWe are confronted with stringent lockdowns which have destroyed many people\u2019s lives and livelihoods, limited access to education and these imposed restrictions by governments around the world are a direct attack on people\u2019s basic rights and their personal freedoms, resulting in collateral damage for entire economies on a global scale.\u201d)\n\nAccording to Yeadon and his team of independent researchers:\n\nYeadon\u2019s analysis is similar to that of Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master\u2019s degree program at John Hopkins. Briand wanted to see the effect that Covid had on excess deaths using the CDC\u2019s own data. What she found was extraordinary, but consistent with Yeadon\u2019s analysis. Here\u2019s a brief summary of what she discovered:\n\nThe research of both Yeadon and Brand help to show how fake testing results, manipulated mortality data, relentless deception and disorienting state mandates (masks, lockdown etc) have fueled public hysteria creating the compliant population our rulers seek. After 8 months of this psychic-drubbing, the elites are now ready to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce, a vaccine containing potentially-toxic substance that will change the course of history.\n\nPerhaps, but there are plenty of reasons to be concerned. Keep in mind, the most enthusiastic proponents of these experimental vaccines (media) are the same people:\n\u2022 Who lied about Trump-Russia for 3 years nonstop.\n\u2022 Who aggressively censored any information on Hunter Biden\u2019s massive influence peddling operation.\n\u2022 Who covered up any information related to last month\u2019s stolen presidential election.\n\nThe media are the enemy of the people, and they have proved that many times over. But, how can we apply this rule to the roll-out of the new vaccines?\n\nWe can assume that the interests of the wealthy powerbrokers\u2013 who own the media and set their agenda\u2013 will take precedence over the people who are in line to be vaccinated. That\u2019s all. Their interests will take priority over your safety. That\u2019s the way it works.\n\nSo, one should be extremely wary of vaccines that are rushed to market in record time, just as they should be suspicious of the motives of people who see \u201cskepticism\u201d or \u201chesitancy\u201d as a \u201cnational security threat\u201d. These people are not to be trusted. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nWhy, for example, would the British government enlist \u201cmilitary intelligence to seek out and stamp out what The Times calls \u201canti-vaccine militants\u201d and related \u201cpropaganda content\u201d in cyberspace\u201d??\n\nWhy would the social media giants remove articles that are critical of the vaccines?\n\nWhy are all the media and public health experts pushing for mass vaccination?\n\nThe answer is obvious, isn\u2019t it?\n\nIt\u2019s because the wealthy powerbrokers that are orchestrating this operation, want to see We the People vaccinated en masse. That\u2019s what this is all about.\n\nSo, the question is: Why? Why is it so important to them? Is it because they want to save lives?\n\nNo, that\u2019s not it at all. There\u2019s obviously something else going on that we don\u2019t know about. Maybe it\u2019s climate change, maybe it\u2019s over-population, or maybe it\u2019s a collective determination to transform society into a technocratic dystopia. (\u201cThe Great Reset\u201d). We don\u2019t really know, but one thing is certain, all this ballyhoo about Covid is a red herring. It simply diverts attention from the real agenda, which is why we should be cautious about the vaccines. Mass vaccination could, in fact, be the ultimate objective. Check out Yeadon\u2019s take on vaccines in a recent edition of LifeSite News:\n\nIs he right? Are the vaccines an unnecessary risk that serve no earthly purpose? Here\u2019s more from Yeadon on the potential downside effects of the new mRNA-based vaccines which are \u201call the rage\u201d.\n\u2022 The new messenger RNA vaccines could make recipients more susceptible to serious illness or death.\n\u2022 Spike proteins can \u201ctrigger an immune reaction\u201d that will \u201cresult in infertility.\u201d (Once again, Population control)\n\u2022 The new vaccines contain polyethylene glycol (PEG) which can be \u201cpotentially fatal.\u201d\n\u2022 The trials were not long enough to determine whether the vaccines are safe or not. FDA approval does not mean \u201csafe\u201d. Quite the contrary. The FDA is \u201ccaptured\u201d in the same way the FAA is captured. (Think: Boeing 737 Max)\n\nThe new regime of Covid-19 vaccines is both unnecessary and risky. Readers should ignore the hype and do their own research. Take responsibility for your own health and welfare. Do not expect the media or public health officials to tell the truth. They won\u2019t. They want to use you as a guinea pig in their deranged lab experiment. Do not cooperate, do not comply, do not acquiesce, do not give in.\n\nMike Whitney is a frequent contributor to Global Research.
