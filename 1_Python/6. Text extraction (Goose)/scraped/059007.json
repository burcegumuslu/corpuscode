They can also provide long-lasting protection. A person who recovers from measles, for example, is protected for life against measles by the adaptive immune system,\u201d wrote the study authors.\n\nClinical trial data involving COVID-19 vaccines previously found that the vaccines impair the production of white blood cells, a critical component of the body\u2019s immune system. This investigation found a significant decrease in lymphocytes in people who have taken Pfizer\u2019s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nLymphocytes, like T cells and B cells, are types of white blood cells and are important parts of the immune system.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Swedish researchers reported a loss of immune function associated with the invasion of the spike protein into the cell nucleus, combined with previous clinical trial data that found transient reductions in the number of white blood cells, may explain reports of increased COVID infections shortly after vaccination,\u201d wrote Lyn Redwood for Children\u2019s Health Defense.\n\nImmune suppression by the vaccines can lead to cancer\n\nClinical epidemiological data shows that the immunosuppressive effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can significantly increase a person\u2019s risk of getting cancer.\n\nLymphocytes, especially the T cells, are well recognized for the significant role they play in preventing cancer by their ability to attack and kill cancer cells before they spread.\n\nThe data shows that people injected with the mRNA vaccine can experience a temporary immune suppression or immune dysregulation that can last a week or even longer. Other research shows that the mRNA vaccines can \u201creprogram\u201d adaptive and innate immune responses.\n\nIn particular, the vaccines downregulate the TLR4 pathway, which is known to play a crucial role in the immune system\u2019s response to infections and cancer cells. (Related: THE VACCINE-CANCER ATROCITY: Like clockwork, most vaccinated Americans will lose immune function by Christmas and start growing accelerated CANCER tumors that will kill them over the next ten years.)\n\nThis combination of factors means that if a vaccinated person has a tumor somewhere in his or her body \u2013 known or unknown \u2013 or if they have a predisposition to some type of cancer, a state of immune suppression or dysregulation induced by the vaccine could potentially trigger the sudden growth of the tumor or tumors in the weeks following vaccination.\n\nThe current scientific consensus is that the vaccines themselves do not contain any carcinogenic substances, but this claim needs to be properly investigated. The extent of the vaccine-induced tumor growth is also currently uncertain.\n\nBut the conclusions of the studies are supported by real-world evidence proving that there are already several thousand reports of vaccine-caused cancer.\n\nBack in August, clinical pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole described a significant increase in certain types of cancer \u2013 including breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate and pancreatic \u2013 since the beginning of the mass vaccination campaign in the United States.\n\nMore recently, German pathologists noted the sudden growth of tumors caused by post-vaccine immune dysregulation.\n\nListen to this Situation Update episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report,\u201d a podcast by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks about how the COVID-19 swab tests have been found to contain alarming levels of ethylene oxide. This is a toxic gas used to sterilize medical equipment that can increase a person\u2019s risk of developing cancerous tumors.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nLearn more about the adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study: COVID-19 vaccines found to weaken the immune system, increase risk of developing cancer", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cancer.news/2021-12-22-mrna-vaccines-weaken-immune-system-cause-cancer.html", "site_name": "Cancer News", "description": "A recent study conducted by Swedish researchers has found that mRNA Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines weaken a person\u2019s immune system and increase their\u00a0likelihood of developing cancer.
