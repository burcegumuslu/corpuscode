Well\u2026 for certain strains, the vaccine is less effective and now researchers know one reason why.\n\nA study out of California looked at the common practice of growing influenza vaccine components in chicken eggs. The process is supposed to allow the virus to replicate in the eggs, then the purified virus from the eggs would be used in vaccines. However the study showed that several strains of the virus actually mutate when grown in chicken eggs\u2026 making them less effective in humans. The H3N2 strain was one used in the study\u2026 it\u2019s become more prevalent each season and has been included in the vaccines\u2026 but recent vaccines have proven only 33 percent effective against that particular strain.\n\nReducing calories has been linked to a number of health benefits\u2026 now researchers from Brazil are finding even more beneficial effects\u2026\n\nThe study looked at two groups of mice over six months\u2026 one group was allowed to eat as much as they wanted at all times\u2026 the other was fed a diet with 60 percent of the calories of the first group. After the six months, the calorie restricted group had a 40 percent lower body mass. But the group also found that the calorie restricted group adapted to grow more fur and have three times more blood vessels in their skin. Both changes help keep the body warm and compensated for the lack of fat that would typically do that.\n\nBy the way\u2026 the group that ate what they wanted became obese. The author said the goal of the study is to look at how calorie restriction affects different tissues and to hopefully use the information to target diseases associated with weight gain.\n\nWe all know that exercise is a big part of a healthy life\u2026 but new research is showing you might now want to do it alone!\n\nThe study out of Maine looked at 69 medical students who selected a 12 week exercise program either with a group or as individuals\u2026 every four weeks the participants completed a survey. At the end of 12 weeks\u2026 those who participated in group exercise reported improvements in mental, physical and emotional quality of life. Those who worked out alone, exercised twice as long\u2026 but saw similar benefit in mental quality of life\u2026 but no changes in either physical or emotional quality.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s making headlines in natural health this week\u2026 make sure to stay connected by going to ihealthtube and sign up for our free email newsletter!", "opengraph": {"site_name": "iHealthTube.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ihealthtube.com/video/why-flu-shot-doesnt-work-many", "title": "Why The Flu Shot Doesn't Work for Many", "description": "Support us for as little as $2 at http://www.patreon.com/ihealthtube You can find our free email newsletter at http://www.ihealthtube.com/content/newsletter Why is one strain of the flu vaccine not very effective?
