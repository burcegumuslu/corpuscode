Ricardo is responsible for coordinating the Spanish research team\u2019s analysis of the impacts of graphene oxide nano-particles contained in the vial of the mRNA vaccine.\n\nThe results of their analysis by electron microscopy and spectroscopy are far-reaching. Graphene oxide is a toxin which triggers thrombi and blood coagulation. It also has an impact on the immune system. Graphene oxide accumulated in the lungs can have devastating impacts.\n\nThe results of the Spanish study suggest, yet to be fully confirmed and ascertained, that the recorded vaccine related deaths and \u201cadverse events\u201d (e.g. published in the US by the CDC and in the EU) are attributable to the presence of graphene oxide nano-particles contained in the Covid vaccine vial.\n\nOf significance, (acknowledged by national health authorities) graphene oxide is also contained in the face mask.\n\nGraphene has electromagnetic properties which have been detected in people who have been vaccinated. These effects have been amply documented and confirmed. See the study conducted by the European Forum for Vaccine Vigilance\n\nRicardo Delgado Martin is specialized in biostatistics, clinical microbiology, clinical genetics and immunology.\n\nFor further details on this project see the report by Prof. Dr. Pablo Campra Madrid, specialized in Chemistry and Biology, Escuela Superior de Ingener\u00eda, University of Almer\u00eda.\n\nSee summary of their report entitled Graphene Oxide Detection in Aqueous Suspension, Observational study in Optical and Electron Microscopy.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Spanish research team, Ricardo Delgado Martin recommends that the covid-19 experimental mRNA vaccine should be cancelled and discontinued immediately.\n\nThis is a controversial study. There are scientists and medical doctors who disagree with the results of the Spanish study.\n\nThe evidence has to be either ascertained or refuted. What is required is that independent scientists and health professionals conduct their own lab analysis of the contents of the vaccine vial.\n\nSimilarly, we call upon the national health authorities of the 193 member states of the UN which are currently vaccinating their people, to conduct their own study and analysis of the vaccine vial. And if graphene-oxide is detected, the vaccination program should immediately be discontinued.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Health and Welfare", "Videos"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.globalresearch.ca/face-masks-contain-graphene-a-poisonous-substance/5749855", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/study-electromagnetism-vaccinated-persons-luxembourg/5749516", "https://www.globalresearch.ca/graphene-oxide-detection-aqueous-suspension/5749529", "https://www.docdroid.net/Ov1M99x/official-interim-report-in-english-university-of-almeria-pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
