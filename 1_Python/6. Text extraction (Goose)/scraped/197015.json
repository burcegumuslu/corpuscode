Gottlieb aggressively demanded swift action against Giroir and others whose tweets threatened to cut into Pfizer\u2019s bottom line in terms of covid \u201cvaccine\u201d sales and uptake.\n\nOn Aug. 27, 2021, Gottlieb told Twitter executive Todd O\u2019Boyle to take immediate action against Giroir for daring to talk about natural immunity. Gottlieb called Giroir\u2019s word\u2019s \u201ccorrosive,\u201d presumably in reference to Pfizer\u2019s profit streams.\n\n\u201cHere he draws a sweeping conclusion off a single retrospective study in Israel that hasn\u2019t been peer reviewed,\u201d Gottlieb complained about Giroir in his email to O\u2019Boyle. \u201cBut this tweet will end up going viral and driving news coverage.\u201d\n\nGottlieb, who rakes in nearly half a million dollars annually as a Pfizer board member, was really upset that Giroir wrote that post-infection immunity \u201cis superior to vaccine immunity, by A LOT [sic].\u201d Telling the truth like this is bad business for Pfizer, so Gottlieb did what he could to silence Giroir.\n\nHow many lives were ruined or lost because of Gottlieb\u2019s interference?\n\nKeep in mind that Giroir never actually told anyone to not get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for covid. In fact, he wrote in the same \u201coffending\u201d tweet that people who have not been previously infected with the Fauci Flu should still \u201cget vaccinated,\u201d which was still not enough for Gottlieb.\n\nIn order to continue generating tens of billions of dollars in obscene new profits, Pfizer needs everyone to keep getting injected over and over and over again \u2013 which some of them will not do if they read messages like Giroir\u2019s pointing to studies showing the superiority of natural immunity.\n\nThe same study that Gottlieb complained was never peer-reviewed, by the way, ended up being peer-reviewed, followed by its eventual publishing in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The paper:\n\n\u201c\u2026 demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity.\u201d\n\nFollowing Gottlieb\u2019s complaint about Giroir\u2019s post, a Twitter analyst who reviewed it ultimately decided that it did not violate the platform\u2019s \u201cmisinformation\u201d rule. Even so, because of Gottlieb\u2019s interference, Twitter ended up slapping a \u201cmisinformation\u201d label across it, preventing it from being shared and having wider reach.\n\nTo this day, Giroir stands by his post, claiming that it \u201cwas accurate then, and it remains so now.\u201d Gottlieb, meanwhile, also defends his interference, claiming that all he was trying to do was address \u201cfalse and inflammatory\u201d information that just so happens, by coincidence, to negatively affect his and Pfizer\u2019s income and profit streams.\n\nGottlieb also complained about another similar post from Justin Hart, who warned his followers that covid is a non-issue for children \u2013 thus, \u201cvaccinating\u201d them is imprudent and medically useless, Hart\u2019s tweet suggested without actually stating such.\n\n\u201c\u2026 sticks and stones may break my bones but a viral pathogen with a child mortality rate of <>0% has cost our children nearly three years of schooling,\u201d Hart wrote, much to the chagrin of Gottlieb.\n\nTo learn more about the dangers and ineffectiveness of covid \u201cvaccines,\u201d be sure to check out ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Leaked emails show Pfizer board member bullied Twitter into censoring tweets about natural immunity, low (zero) covid risk in children", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2023-01-12-pfizer-bullied-twitter-censoring-tweets-natural-immunity.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "The reason why former U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Dr. Brett Giroir was censored on Twitter for talking about natural immunity to covid is because fellow former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, now a Pfizer board member, pushed Twitter to censor Giroir and many others.
