Each our bodies are self-organizing systems. In our gloriously flawed evolutionary uniqueness, we are each comprised of (give or take) 6 trillion cells, 60 trillion bacteria, and 180 billion viruses.\n\nDr. Zac Bush elegantly explains \u2013 with a message of hope and healing as we enter what promises to be a turbulent year.\n\nAnd here are DOZENS of ways to treat COVID-19 (and all other viral infections) without Physical Distancing, Masking, Locking Down, Staying Home and Consuming the \u201cNews\u201d while waiting for the CDC and the WHO to tell you it is OK to again resume living a Fully Human life.\n\nWhile we keep one eye on what appears to be a \u201cColor Revolution\u201d unfolding in the US Empire\u2019s DC Beltway, a CR built on a Constitutional Crisis two decades in the making, we are keeping our other eye on the COVIDtastrophe as it continues to unfold in our Green Mountains.\n\nAs we reported in our four part 2020 COVID EMPIRE series, the Transhumanist Technocrats (TechnoFascism, for short) are knocking at our Civilizational Door, and #TeamHuman has some difficult choices to make in 2021 and Beyond here in our Green Mountains.\n\nLook no further than the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s December 2020 report entitled Taking Back Control: A Resetting of America\u2019s Response to Covid-19, promising 1) increased PCR testing (scientifically nonsensical above 32 cycles, and deeply corrupt from a policy POV); 2) more and more \u2018vaccines\u2019 \u2013 meaning untested mRNA gene-altering injections; 3) more and more surveillance; 3) more and more economic centralization and control \u2013 all in the name of \u201cresetting America\u2019s response to the COVID.\u201d\n\nWell well well. See below.\n\nSome sanity, in the form of a single number, is in order.\n\nAs former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson writes in his \u201cmust read\u201d 2020 UNREPORTED TRUTHS ABOUT COVID-19 pamphlet, \u201cthe most fundamental unreported truth about the coronavirus [is that] about 999 out of 1,000 people who get it will survive.\u201d\n\n\u201c999 out of 1,000 people who get the coronavirus will survive.\u201d \u2013 Alex Berenson\n\nBerenson\u2019s work parallels our own research here at Vermont Independent \u2013 captured in our \u201cBeyond COVIDphobia\u201d Op/Ed from last spring 2020 \u2013 see below. As we enter 2021, nearly a year of global data collection has only strengthened our ELEVEN conclusions.\n\nIn the face of Science and Sanity, COVIDiopaths like the Rockefeller Foundation plan to move forward with their \u201cTaking Back Control\u201d viral agendas in 2021.

Consider just one authoritative source \u2013 Dr. Denis Rancourt \u2013 whose ongoing scientific reviews have shed light on said consequences. His exhaustive new \u201cReview update of recent science relating to COVID-19 policy\u201d report, courtesy of PANDA (Pandemics Data and Analysis), is worth a close read. His conclusions will come as no surprise to regular VI readers \u2013 but for those who are interested in \u201clistening to the science,\u201d Rancourt\u2019s conclusions are vital for making Vermont Human again.\n\nAnd here are links to our ongoing VI reporting on the COVIDtastrophe \u2013 organized by both \u201csearch term\u201d and our latest 2020 article \u2013 we\u2019ll add new 2021 stories below each category as they come in.\n\nMasking and our Last 2020 Article\n\nTHE BLAZE: Comprehensive Analysis of 50 states shows greater spread with mask mandates (Dec 21, 2020)\n\nPCR \u2018Testing\u2019 and our Last 2020 Article\n\nSEVEN DAYS article: From October 2020 explaining why Vermont is using (\u201cscientifically nonsensical\u201d \u2013 our words) PCR tests rather than Rapid Antigen tests.

Cowan, MD, and Sally Fallon Morell ask the question: are there really such things as \u201cviruses\u201d? Or are electro smog, toxic living conditions, and 5G actually to blame for COVID-19?\n\nThe official explanation for today\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic is a \u201cdangerous, infectious virus.\u201d This is the rationale for isolating a large portion of the world\u2019s population in their homes so as to curb its spread. From face masks to social distancing, from antivirals to vaccines, these measures are predicated on the assumption that tiny viruses can cause serious illness and that such illness is transmissible person-to-person.\n\nIt was Louis Pasteur who convinced a skeptical medical community that contagious germs cause disease; his \u201cgerm theory\u201d now serves as the official explanation for most illness. However, in his private diaries, he states unequivocally that in his entire career he was not once able to transfer disease with a pure culture of bacteria (he obviously wasn\u2019t able to purify viruses at that time). He admitted that the whole effort to prove contagion was a failure, leading to his famous death bed confession that \u201cthe germ is nothing, the terrain is everything.\u201d\n\nWhile the incidence and death statistics for COVID-19 may not be reliable, there is no question that many people have taken sick with a strange new disease\u2014with odd symptoms like gasping for air and \u201cfizzing\u201d feelings\u2014and hundreds of thousands have died. Many suspect that the cause is not viral but a kind of pollution unique to the modern age\u2014electromagnetic pollution. Today we are surrounded by a jangle of overlapping and jarring frequencies\u2014from power lines to the fridge to the cell phone. It started with the telegraph and progressed to worldwide electricity, then radar, then satellites that disrupt the ionosphere, then ubiquitous Wi-Fi. The most recent addition to this disturbing racket is fifth-generation wireless\u20145G. In The Contagion Myth: Why Viruses (including Coronavirus) are Not the Cause of Disease, bestselling authors Thomas S. Cowan, MD, and Sally Fallon Morell tackle the true causes of COVID-19.\n\nOn September 26, 2019, 5G wireless was turned on in Wuhan, China (and officially launched November 1) with a grid of about ten thousand antennas\u2014more antennas than exist in the whole United States, all concentrated in one city. A spike in cases occurred on February 13, the same week that Wuhan turned on its 5G network for monitoring traffic. Illness has subsequently followed 5G installation in all the major cities in America.\n\nSince the dawn of the human race, medicine men and physicians have wondered about the cause of disease, especially what we call \u201ccontagions,\u201d numerous people ill with similar symptoms, all at the same time. Does humankind suffer these outbreaks at the hands of an angry god or evil spirit? A disturbance in the atmosphere, a miasma? Do we catch the illness from others or from some outside influence?\n\nAs the restriction of our freedoms continues, more and more people are wondering whether this is true. Could a packet of RNA fragments, which cannot even be defined as a living organism, cause such havoc? Perhaps something else is involved\u2014something that has upset the balance of nature and made us more susceptible to disease? Perhaps there is no \u201ccoronavirus\u201d at all; perhaps, as Pasteur said, \u201cthe germ is nothing, the terrain is everything.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "title": "The Contagious Myth \u2013 Vermont Independent", "url": "https://vermontindependent.net/tag/the-contagious-myth/", "site_name": "Vermont Independent", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["mandate", "911", "Big Data", "NYT", "Poop", "Andorra", "Substack Nation", "Wetware", "Ben Scotch", "Breathe", "CDC", "Wokeness", "Compromise of 1850", "JP", "Naomi Klein", "Ownership", "Bionutrient.org", "Space Fence", "H.
