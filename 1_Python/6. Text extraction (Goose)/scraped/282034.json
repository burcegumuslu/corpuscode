Meanwhile, many natural health experts continue to sound the alarm on the dangers of vaccines and their toxic additives \u2013 and maintain that they are neither effective nor safe.\n\nChemical violence and vaccine fraud being played on the American people. On the next NaturalNews Talk Hour, Jonathan Landsman and Suzanne Humphries, MD \u2013 board-certified internist and vaccine safety expert \u2013 will talk about the shocking consequences of vaccinations. Drawing on her extensive medical background (and experience), Dr. Humphries will clarify many vaccine misconceptions, expose the unspoken flaw of \u2018herd immunity,\u2019 and show us how to truly protect our health.

With this level of misinformation on both sides, says Dr. Humphries, \u201cinformed consent\u201d becomes impossible.\n\nMeanwhile, comprehensive scientific studies on the safety of vaccines are sorely lacking. In fact, no placebo-controlled safety study of the MMR vaccine exploring possible neurological and autoimmune outcomes has ever been done in humans. Making matters worse, some studies have used \u201cfalse placebos\u201d \u2013 in which another vaccine is utilized as the control placebo (not the sterile solution that would constitute a true placebo). And, shockingly, most vaccines have never even undergone a cancer risk assessment of any kind.\n\nQuite frankly, the lack of safety studies \u2013 and the use of untested vaccines \u2013 is deeply troubling and one that Dr. Humphries says violates the Nuremberg Code of \u201cinformed and unambiguous\u201d consent.\n\nTo hear this FREE show \u2013 visit http://www.naturalhealth365.com/free-shows and enter your email address for show details plus some great gifts.\n\nVaccines not only rob people of the ability to develop their own natural immunity, says Dr. Humphries, but the very act of being vaccinated can alter the immune system so that the individual becomes more susceptible to other infectious diseases.\n\nIn addition, vaccinations can cause repeated, chronic inflammation \u2013 triggering allergies and autoimmune problems.\n\nVaccinations can be particularly dangerous in infancy, because the process disrupts the \u201canti-inflammatory phenotype\u201d that is essential to proper development of the immune system. Being vaccinated \u201cderails\u201d this system, forcing an unnatural and untimely immune response, reports Dr. Humphries.\n\nFinally, Dr. Humphries points to the constant tinkering with vaccines as proof of their inefficacy. \u201cNow we have \u2018new and improved\u2019 Gardasil\u2026 and a new pertussis vaccine. (But) \u2026no vaccine has ever been shown to do what it\u2019s predicted to do.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t become a victim of this form of \u2018chemical violence,\u2019 be sure to join us for an enlightening and empowering show about our health.\n\nThis week\u2019s guest: Suzanne Humphries, M.D., board-certified in internal medicine and an expert on vaccine safety issues\n\nDiscover the truth about vaccines \u2013 including the shocking reality about their effectiveness \u2013 Sun.

A conventionally-trained doctor as well as a holistic health consultant, she brings her own experiences and research to bear on the study of vaccines and their consequences.\n\nDr. Humphries became interested in vaccine injuries when she witnessed them among her own patients \u2013 and saw them met with indifference by mainstream medicine.
