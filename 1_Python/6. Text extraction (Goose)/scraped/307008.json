The project was allegedly started to censor misinformation about Dr. Anthony Fauci, covid-19, and mrna vaccines. Yet it ended up deliberately banning numerous true stories.\n\nThis thread, labeled Twitter Files 19.0, highlights Virality Project e-mails that describe \u201cstories of true vaccine side effects\u201d as worthy of censorship. So not only were academic, corporate and government censors working together to suppress stories about Dr. Fauci and the Wuhan lab leak on social media, they were also working together to suppress stories about mrna vaccine side effects that they knew were true.\n\nNew, scarier model: Anyone familiar with the first 18 batches of Twitter Files knows that the U.S. government was and is telling social media companies what to censor. But until now, it appeared that government censors were mostly blocking conservative opinions they considered misinformation. Twitter Files 19.0 is our first explicit reference to government censors banning stories they knew were true purely for political reasons.\n\nThough the Virality Project reviewed content on a mass scale \u2026 it knowingly targeted true material and legitimate political opinion, while often being factually wrong itself. This story is important for two reasons. One, as Orwellian proof-of-concept, the Virality Project was a smashing success. Government, academia, and an oligarchy of would-be corporate competitors organized quickly behind a secret, unified effort to control political messaging. Two, it accelerated the evolution of digital censorship, moving it away from judging truth/untruth to a new, scarier model, openly focused on political narrative at the expense of fact.\n\n \u2014Matt Taibbi\n\nCasting down the truth: An end-time Bible prophecy shows that an evil spirit will use a host to cast truth to the ground. \u201cYea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered\u201d (Daniel 8:11-12).\n\nStrong\u2019s Concordance defines \u201chost\u201d as \u201ca mass of persons (or figuratively, things), especially regiments organized for war (an army).\u201d Depending on the context, the expression refers to an army of demons, angels or men. The host in Daniel 8 is an army of demons and men who help an end-time Antiochus. This host aims to destroy the United States, its Judeo-Christian history, its constitutional form of government, and the biblical principles this form of government is based upon. Social media giants like Facebook, Google and TikTok empower this host.\n\nLearn more: Read America Under Attack, by Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/27205-twitter-files-expose-covid-19-lie-machine", "site_name": "theTrumpet.com", "title": "World News, Economics and Analysis Based on Bible Prophecy", "image": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/trumpet-icon.png", "description": "theTrumpet.com delivers in-depth news analysis on top stories, world news, weather, economics and society in the light of Bible prophecy.", "type": "website"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1636729166631432195", "https://www.thetrumpet.com/literature/books_and_booklets/3967"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
