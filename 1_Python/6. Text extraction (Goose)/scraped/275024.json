This type of smallpox is a rare viral infection that is similar to human smallpox. Compared to human smallpox, monkeypox has a milder form. Its counterparts had previously been detected in West and Central Africa. Similar cases were reported back in the 1970s in the Congo. Today, a new form of the virus is detected. Among the basic symptoms are fever, headache, and a skin rash on the face that spreads to other parts of the body.\n\nSo far, cases of monkeypox have been confirmed by authorities in the United States, Canada, Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, Italy, Sweden, Australia, Belgium and Germany.\n\nAround 80 confirmed cases of infection have been registered worldwide, but the WHO says about another 50 patients with suspected disease. The largest number of infected at the moment is in Spain, 30 people have fallen ill there. In the UK, 11 people have fallen ill, and in Portugal, 9 people have fallen ill. As a result, the WHO reported confirmed cases of the disease in 16 countries.\n\nAccording to WHO expert Rosamund Lewis, the virus does not mutate. The probability of mutation of the virus is extremely low, and the WHO is working to identify the genome of the virus to understand the reasons for its origin. Another WHO expert, Maria von Kerckhoff, stated that the virus is not particularly dangerous, especially in Europe, as the situation is currently under control. A smallpox vaccine has been chosen as the cure. Based on this vaccine, further vaccines against the virus are being developed. At the moment, the effectiveness of the vaccine is 85%.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the new outbreaks are unusual, occurring in countries for which the disease is uncommon. The organization also warns that transmission may accelerate in the summer months because people will congregate more often and the virus is transmitted by airborne droplets. But monkeypox is not easily transmitted from person to person. The type of transmission of the virus is similar to the one of smallpox \u2014 close contact of a person with a person, one can also get infected by contact with human biological fluids, by contact with secretions from the pustules of the sick person and by interacting with his personal belongings. According to the British Health Service, the disease is usually mild, with most people recovering within a few weeks. The WHO has already assembled an emergency team of experts to detect an outbreak of monkeypox. The WHO recommends avoiding contact with monkeys, rodents, sick people, and dead animals.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 White House Doctor Prescribed Not To Hate COVID, But Russians", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "New Global Trend: Monkeypox", "description": "As soon as the MSM forget about the COVID pandemic, the world was shaken by another disease \u2013 monkeypox.
