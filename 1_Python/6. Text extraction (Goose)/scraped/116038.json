I absolutely love this!\n\nDid I tell you I was Policy Debate State Champion three years in a row in high school? I spent all my high school summer months up in places like Dartmouth College researching all the facts and collecting evidence for the topic each year. One year the topic was health care \u2013 so I learned a lot about the industry that year.\n\nI\u2019d like to share some everyday habits & eats that build immunity.\n\nThis was my day today. Notice I didn\u2019t eat any fast food like Chick-fil-A. That stuff will will give more than just the flu.\n\nMorning \u2013 Started my day out as usual \u2013 A big glass of hot water with lemon and cayenne.\n\nLemons are anti-bacterial, have been proven to prevent viruses like cholera and provide a load of vitamin C boosting the immune system. Cayenne helps clean the blood and stimulates your entire body, thus allowing your hormones to work naturally to boost your immune system.\n\nI then took a scoop of Vitamineral Green Powder + 1 of my 15 Billion Adult Formula Probiotics.\n\nProbiotics are crucial for a strong immune system. When your body is filled with billions of strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus cultures it prevents pathogens from entering your digestive system because essentially there is no room for the bad bacteria to survive. Pretty cool, eh? I need to dedicate a post just to probiotics. EVERYONE should be taking them. And EVERYDAY. Probiotics are a HUGE immune booster.\n\nAnother immunity building ingredient in the powder is Wheatgrass and a whole load of other flu preventing ingredients \u2013 I could go on and on forever.\n\nAnd then I either have some Larry\u2019s Beans Fair Trade Organic Coffee or some green tea \u2013 One cup a day is all you need to get the antioxidant boost that helps prevent sickness and disease. More than one cup of coffee is questionable, because it make the body acidic. This same basic principle works for alcohol too.\n\nTo continue with my morning ritual \u2013 I headed to the gym for some exercise.\n\nModerate exercise has been shown to reduce the time a person experiences the cold and flu and helps you to naturally prevent contracting viruses in the first place. Exercise stimulates the production of macrophagus, the cells that fight bacteria. Additionally many of your organs are made up of muscles, exercise helps them to function properly preventing disease. This is a great reason to exercise everyday.\n\nThere are always caveats \u2013 for you marathon runners and exercise-o-holics \u2013 there is a blog post in the NY times that talks about a study conducted last year comparing mice who ran moderately vs. mice who ran for a longer distances or for a longer period of time. The mice who exerted more energy on a regular basis died when infected by the flu vaccine and the mice who moderately exercise survived at a higher rate. You can read about it here and judge it yourself. After working out \u2013 I spun up some fresh kale, celery, cilantro, ginger, lemon and garlic Juice. The ingredient I want to highlight here is garlic. Garlic has sulfur-containing compounds, allicin and sulfides that produce antibodies naturally in your bloodstream preventing viruses. My breath wasn\u2019t excited but I could tell my body thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nAt work I finished my breakfast up with some Chia Seeds and Garden of Life Raw Protein. Chia Seeds are a superfood and a fantastic source of omega 3 fatty acids \u2013 They produce phagocytes, the white blood cells that eat up bad bacteria. They also create a strong respiratory system which is key to preventing complications like pneumonia from colds or the flu.\n\nAfternoon \u2013 At my desk I devoured a huge salad with arugula, my beet sweetened hummus, avocado, red onion, and blueberries. Lots of immunity fighters here. The beets and the carrots in the hummus provide a ton of carotenoids. Beta carotene increases the number of infection-fighting cells, natural fighter cells, and helper T-cells, as well as being a powerful antioxidant preventing disease from forming in your body. Beta carotene is also converted into Vitamin A \u2013 a natural immune boosting vitamin. Beets also cleanse the blood and are great for the liver \u2013 your main detoxing organ!\n\nAfter my salad \u2013 I wanted to have something delicious with a cup of tea. I had some of this 90% Raw Cacao Bar with Goji Berries. Raw cacao is the number one source of antioxidants in the world. Cacao is jam packed with potent immune system boosting substances called epicatechins. The gogis just top off the benefits with a ton of Vitamin C and polysaccharides \u2013 the compounds that help your body resist disease. I never thought a snack like this could be so powerful in your diet\u2026 They aren\u2019t called superfoods for nothing. Later in the day, I had Parfait Porridge topped with blueberries and pineapple and mixed raw vegetables for my pre-Yoga snack (with at least 2 hours to digest).\n\nOat Groats, the main ingredient for Parfait Porridge has a modifier called beta glucan that helps your cells find disease more quickly and eliminate them from your body. Pretty freakin\u2019 cool \u2013 if you ask me. After work, I rushed over to Yoga One to enjoy a nice hot sweaty session with one my favorite teachers \u2013 Johnna Smith.\n\nThe overall benefits of Yoga are so amazing for your immunity that I could yell them from every roof top. But one particular pose \u2013 Wheel pose stimulates a acupressure point in the spine that is directly related to your immunity. The \u201cSea of Vitality\u201d point is said to govern the immune system \u2013 especially helping with colds and flus. Being cold and flu season, I stayed in this pose the maximum time today \ud83d\ude42\n\nObviously I didn\u2019t fly to Tokyo and do this wheel pose and come back today \u2013 I tried to sneak some Yoga One pictures in but they didn\u2019t turn out that good. So here\u2019s one from high above Tokyo\u2026.\n\nAt Night \u2013 I had my Mom\u2019s delicious black chickpeas, indian split lentil soup and lots of steamed broccoli. The beans were cooked with lots of ginger, garlic and cumin \u2013 which prevents cough formation when your body comes in contact with respiratory infections\u2026 The broccoli has a special compound called sulforaphane which activates certain antioxidant genes and enzymes in specific immune cells that can battle colds and the flu.\n\nDessert \u2013 Ginger tea and a few prunes and Wild Incan Golden Berries \u2013 All of these ingredients boost the immune system \u2013 especially the ginger. I ran out of fresh ginger (because I used it in my juice earlier), but luckily I had this Yogi Tea on hand. Ginger has a serious laundry list when it comes to protecting and building your immunity \u2013 It\u2019s antimicrobial, antibacterial, it has two natural anti-biotics, prevents disease from entering your body, inhibits pain receptors, stimulates circulation, eliminates congestion and sore throats, and more and more and more. Lesson here \u2013 Get some ginger \u2013 I had it three different times today!\n\n\n\nBe happy, healthy and free of the flu!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How to Boost Your Immunity Naturally", "description": "My recent article on the Flu Vaccine has created a great debate here on Food Babe and on my Facebook Wall.\u00a0I absolutely love this!
