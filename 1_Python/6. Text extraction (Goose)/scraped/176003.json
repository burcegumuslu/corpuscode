The lady in the image above was astute enough to keep a hold of the original printed newspaper. The link for free download is at the bottom of this article.\n\nOn April 26th, 2009 the Irish Independent published an article titled \u2018Concern for Children\u2019s Health as Parents ignoring vaccines\u2019. Edel Kennedy, you should be ashamed of yourself! This is nothing less than an attempt by government, through their puppets in the media, to remove the rights of parents to determine the life choices of their offspring and removes any doubt that we now live in a dictatorship.\n\nThis is an OUTRAGEOUS insult to every parent in the country who has the common sense to research the efficacy of vaccines themselves by simply looking at the historical record rather than trust politicians whose lies\n\nin the media, including those perpetrated by the Dept. of Health under Mary Harney regarding the farce of \u2018 swine flu\u2019 and the dangerous myth of HPV vaccination, have led the country into the abyss of utter poverty\n\nand sold the country into the communist grasp of European bureaucrats whose sole aim is the destruction of every member nation\u2019s sovereignty leaving them clutching at the bailout begging bowl of the IMF.\n\nThe historical record PROVES this for anyone with a little patience and the courage to investigate the FACTS for themselves, and it does take courage, especially for those in the medical profession whose careers will be at risk if they dare expose this danger to our children. It also shatters their illusions that they\u2019re part of an organization which is far from beneficial to those they believe they\u2019 re protecting from illness. However, their Hypocratic Oath should compel them to investigate such wild claims put out by pharmaceutical giants and their drug dealer sales representatives instead of taking the word of an industry well known as being utterly corrupt and ruthless in its business practices.\n\nThe Irish haemophiliac scandal, where patients were knowingly infected with HIV through contaminated blood\n\nproducts should be enough to convince anyone of Big Pharma\u2019s murderous intent. This brings us to the real reasons for vaccinations. I\u2019m not even going to prove to readers that they don\u2019t work. I\u2019ll simply urge you to look up the historical record. One simple example is the demise of measles.\n\nThe measles death rate had declined by 98% from 1915-1958 prior to any vaccination being introduced.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989, 69% and 89% for measles cases in American school-aged children had been vaccinated.\n\nIn 1995, 56% of ALL measles cases in America were vaccinated.\n\nThese figures come from medical journals. Those 3 simple examples PROVE that unvaccinated children are less likely to contract measles and that the vaccine was useless. Look that up for yourself. All other vaccine claims that they\u2019ve cured or eliminated disease follow a similar pattern. Better hygiene, clean water and good healthy food was the cause of the decline and any doctor worth his smelling salts should know that. If they don\u2019t then they are misinformed on a grand scale or they\u2019re in complete denial. Therein lies the problem. Why have doctors been \u2018indoctrinated\u2019 to believe that vaccines are the sacred cow of medicine when the historical record clearly shows that they are virtually useless?\n\nHold onto your sanity because I have some bad news for you.\n\nThe real reason for vaccinations, apart from the massive profits to the manufacturers, is to ensure that you get sick throughout your life, again not only to enrich these same corporations that made you sick, but to ensure that many, if not all of you, die before you ever receive your pension and when you are no longer any of use to society. That\u2019s why they want you retiring later in life and are forcing you through economic terrorism to work longer regardless of your age or health. They literally want to work you to death. If you don\u2019t work you will be classed as a burden to society, a financial cost which society has to bear, and therefore you will be stigmatised as a \u2018useless eater\u2019; a consumer of resources needed for the rest of society. When Big Pharma can no longer profit from the illness they gave you, you will be left to die.\n\nThis is the depopulation agenda promoted under the United Nations Division of Population under the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. We only need look at Africa, the nation which the United Nations has said themselves, could feed the world. Why then are millions in Africa starving to death on that continent? It\u2019s meant to be that way folks.\n\nAll of us at one time or another have been led to believe in the efficacy of vaccines. I was one of them and had\n\nmy child vaccinated nearly 35 years ago. I wouldn\u2019t even dream of it now. I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re all aware of the real pandemic, as opposed to the fake pandemics of the past. It\u2019s called \u2018CANCER\u2019. Autism is also at crisis (pandemic) levels all across the world where mass vaccination programs exist.\n\nPrior to mass vaccination, cancers were extremely rare, as in almost nonexistent. Today in the western, so called developed world, we face a crisis of cancer to the extent that between one in five to one in two will suffer, many dying, from one form of cancer or another. What\u2019s happened to cause this pandemic?\n\nWe only have to look back at the Jonas Salk polio vaccine that went around the world in the full knowledge that it contained the SV40 virus which had no other purpose than causing cancer; yet it was pushed as a vaccine for polio when, as with measles, polio was well in decline prior to any vaccine due to the same factors.\n\nEnter stage right at the TED 201 0 conference, Mr. Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, the biggest computer firm on the planet. What has Bill Gates to do with vaccines you\u2019 re wondering?\n\nSee the quote in the image above. Those are his EXACT words. Are you beginning to get the picture?\n\nThe globalist elite care nothing for humanity; ordinary men, women and children must be eliminated in their\n\ndelusional minds to ensure that their superior types go into the future with the best of breeding being the only criteria worthy of saving. You and I are no longer required and that is why we are seeing the loss of our\n\neconomy, our wealth, our health, our happiness and ultimately, OUR LIVES\n\nYou can download a free copy of the the whole issue here:-", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Featured"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://ia601404.us.archive.org/26/items/sovereign-independent-issue-4/Sovereign_Independent_Issue4.pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
