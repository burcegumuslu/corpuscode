Superior Court.\n\n\u201cMs. McNeil\u2019s two minor children were held in a room by Defendant until she overcame their will and forcibly vaccinated them while physically preventing them from consulting with their mother, who was right outside the room,\u201d the 9-page suit states.\n\nThe children were also allegedly provided with \u201cfalse and fraudulent information\u201d in order to get their purported consent to administer the vaccines.\n\nRethy told the kids that they had to get a COVID-19 vaccine to attend school and that they could not legally decline vaccination, according to the filing.\n\nThe kids gave in when given the false information.\n\nRethy and MedStar did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMcNeil took the children to Rethy for annual physical examinations on Sept. 2, 2022.\n\nThe location was the Georgetown Kids Mobile Medical Clinic/Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, which is operated by the Georgetown University Hospital, at a recreation center. Rethy is director of the mobile clinic.\n\nMcNeil waited outside with her 1-year-old child while the two other kids went inside. But she called her daughter\u2019s cell phone soon after and asked to speak with the doctor. McNeil told Rethy she was outside and available if needed to answer questions or provide information.\n\nRethy never asked McNeil about any vaccinations, according to the suit.\n\nThe 16-year-old child, who attends Dunbar High School, went first. Rethy \u201ccame at me with a needle,\u201d the girl was quoted as saying. Rethy, asked what the injection was, said it was a COVID-19 vaccine. The minor said she did not want the shot.\n\n\u201cDr. Rethy told K.M. that the injection was required for her to attend school, and then injected the needle,\u201d the suit states. The younger child, 14, \u201calso reluctantly agreed to accept the injection after seeing his sister be injected, although he had repeatedly refused COVID-19 injections previously as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth children were very upset and angry that they had been coerced into being injected,\u201d the filing states.\n\nRethy also injected the children with a meningococcal vaccine.\n\nNeither Rethy nor clinic staff provided information about the vaccinations to McNeil or the children, the suit says. Rethy did speak with McNeil, but only told her she was going to call a prescription for the asthma of one of the children.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/mother-sues-doctor-who-allegedly-administered-covid-19-vaccines-to-children-without-consent_5107971.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/pfizer-vaccine-doses-and-cards-700x420.jpg?itok=vhxfUCjt", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23698375-mcneil-v-rethy", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/mother-sues-doctor-who-allegedly-administered-covid-19-vaccines-to-children-without-consent_5107971.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
