Significant and compelling medical data demonstrates that the vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness and death among those who contract COVID-19,\u201d the email reads.\n\nPrior to Miyares\u2019 statement, James Madison University\u2019s website outlined student vaccine requirements as a stipulation for living on campus and attending classes. Proof of vaccination for the spring semester was required to be submitted by Dec. 13.\n\n\u201cJMU requires students to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to moving onto campus or attending classes, except as noted in the exemptions section below,\u201d the policy read. \u201cThis includes undergraduate, graduate and part-time students who attend in-person classes, studies, research or activities.\u201d\n\nPrior to the AG\u2019s statement, Virginia Tech\u2019s website read, \u201cAll students must be vaccinated. Any person who is enrolled as a student is required to be vaccinated, [and] receive a booster when eligible.\u201d\n\nAs of yesterday, the same webpage has been modified to read, \u201cWhile not required, Virginia Tech students and employees are encouraged to be vaccinated, get a booster dose, and to report their vaccination status to the university.\u201d\n\nPrior to the AG\u2019s legal opinion, George Mason University\u2019s website read, \u201cFor the safety of our community, Mason will require vaccines for all students, faculty, and staff, and to share verification of their vaccination status to work, study, and live on campus.\u201d\n\nAs of yesterday, George Mason president Gregory Washington released a letter on behalf of the school announcing the mandate would cease, initially citing that they are \u201cwinning the battle\u201d against Covid-19 before mentioning the AG\u2019s legal address.\n\n\u201cAt long last, it can be said: George Mason University is winning the battle against COVID-19. We have not won yet, but we are close\u2026 Given our high vaccination rate, the continued decline of the omicron variant, the Governor\u2019s recent executive orders and directives, and the recent Attorney General\u2019s opinion, we will now strongly encourage vaccination protocols for all Mason students, faculty, and staff, though we no longer require them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Jan. 26, UVA\u2019s vaccination page outlined mandatory vaccines for all \u201cUVA Health team members\u201d as well as all students \u201cwho live, learn, or work in person\u201d at the school.\n\nBut on Jan. 15, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin issued an Executive Directive barring public universities from requiring Covid vaccines for employees.\n\nDue to this EO, along with Miyares\u2019 legal opinion, UVA\u2019s website now clarifies that vaccination is now optional.\n\n\u201cWhile a strong majority of UVA employees are fully vaccinated and have received booster shots, any employee who is not fully vaccinated or boosted (once eligible) is strongly encouraged to get vaccinated or boosted as soon as possible,\u201d its website states.\n\nMost recently, UVA issued a statement eliminating the vaccine requirement in response to Miyares\u2019 advisory statement.\n\n\u201cLast Friday, the Virginia attorney general issued an advisory opinion indicating that public colleges and universities do not have the legal authority to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for students as a condition of enrollment or in-person attendance,\u201d UVA President Jim Ryan said.\n\nDue to the university\u2019s 99% vaccination rate, along with its mandate deadline having already passed, Ryan called the reversal \u201cmoot.\u201d\n\nCampus Reform will be monitoring college and university responses to AG Miyares\u2019 legal opinion.
