They have, more or less tried to convert me to get on board while I was still living at home (2 months ago) by constantly trying to expose me to content around it, playing David Icke on loud speakers in the house, sending me loads of videos on unregulated media platforms (bitchute etc). So I've spend like probably 100 hours going through anti-vax arguments, counter arguments, looking at data, scientists talking about the subject and so on. Essentially, the conclusion I arrived at was that I am happy to be vaccinated and planned to get AstraZeneca, so I told my parents that was the plan and that the decision was made. To which they responded with hysteria, crying, begging and extreme desperation by telling me stories about how all they ever wanted for me was to be healthy and happy and I was going to destroy that if I got vaccinated. They have since calmed down after I moved away to the city, but they still sent me conspiracy videos daily (most of which I ignore now).\n\nBasically, the point of bringing this up and going through the background somewhat, is that I have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca (first dose) about a week ago, not telling my parents, and I cannot stop this consistent paranoia like, maybe they were right, maybe I'm going to be damaged, or maybe this is a massive global power grab and the vaccines are actually really dangerous in the long-run (that's the main one). It's not like these exact comments come up in the form of structured questions, but there is an uncomfortable subconscious monotone of fear that I can't seem to shake even after doing so much research and coming to an indisputable (in my mind) conclusion of the matter. It's like intellectually it's as clear as day, but emotionally it's a shit show.\n\nIs there anything that other people would recommend as a healthy way to try and get past this 'scaring' and not have this paranoia constantly in the background of thinking? Like a practice of some kind (I already meditate) which might help to get off the emotional railway tracks which this mind has been programmed towards in an attempt to cope with life under home conditions?\n\nAny suggestions would be very appreciated, thank you sm", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Getting Over Vaccine Paranoia", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/69959-getting-over-vaccine-paranoia/", "description": "\n\n\tFirstly, I'm very aware that the topic of vaccines is a horse that has been flogged to death on this forum, so in advance I apologise to those who are tir...", "updated_time": "2021-08-19T04:41:24Z", "site_name": "Actualized.org Forum", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["1", "Posted August 9, 2021", "Prev", "Next", "3", "2"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "August 9, 2021"}
