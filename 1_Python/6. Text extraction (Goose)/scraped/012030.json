These studies represent the most often cited papers by scientists, public health officials and members of the media when trying to refute any evidence of an association between vaccinations and autism.\n\nThere are serious methodological limitations, design flaws, conflicts of interest or other problems related to each of these 16 studies. These flaws have been pointed out by government officials, other researchers, medical review panels and even the authors of the studies themselves. Taken together, the limitations of these studies make it impossible to conclude that thimerosal and MMR vaccines are not associated with autism.\n\nSafeMinds would like to acknowledge the previous work in this regard gathered by the \"Fourteen Studies project at Generation Rescue.\n\nOne additional study on autism and thimerosal was published in September 2010 while this paper was in completed draft form. This study\u2019s methods produced a result that demonstrated that thimerosal exposure was protective against autism. Further analysis of this study is forthcoming but not included here.
