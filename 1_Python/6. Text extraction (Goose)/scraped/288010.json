Recent studies have shown that the Covid-19 vaccines can cause inflammation of the heart, a condition known as myocarditis, particularly in young people.\n\nMyocarditis causes inflammation of the heart muscle, which can then cause the heart to become weakened and unable to function properly. Symptoms of myocarditis can include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n\nIn severe cases, myocarditis can lead to heart failure, cardiac arrest, or even death.\n\nWhile the exact cause of myocarditis after vaccination is not yet fully understood, some experts believe it may be due to an immune response triggered by the vaccine that mistakenly attacks the heart tissue.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the increase in deaths among vaccinated children is the emergence of a strange and rare type of blood clotting disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).\n\nThis disorder has been observed in many people who have received the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, and it is thought to be caused by an immune response to the vaccine.\n\nBut data published by both the U.S. CDC and the UK\u2019s MHRA confirm both Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA gene therapy injections are causing the same conditions.\n\nSome medical experts have also raised concerns about the potential long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly on the developing bodies and immune systems of children. It is possible that the vaccines could have unforeseen consequences on children\u2019s health that have not yet been fully understood or studied.\n\nDespite these potential risks and concerns, many Governments and pharmaceutical companies continue to push for widespread vaccination, arguing that the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nHowever, the recent findings from the UK Office for National Statistics and the CDC in the United States suggest that this simply isn\u2019t the case, particularly for children.\n\nIn light of these findings, many experts are now calling for a re-evaluation of the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination for children. The risks of serious adverse events must be weighed carefully against the potential benefits of vaccination, particularly in light of the low risk that COVID-19 poses to children.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence against the safety of COVID-19 vaccination, pharmaceutical companies and governments continue to push for more vaccinations, claiming that they are safe and effective. However, many experts are now calling for a re-evaluation of the risks and benefits of these vaccinations, especially for children.\n\nThe data coming out of both the UK and the USA is sure to ignite a heated debate among healthcare professionals and the public alike, as the question of the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations continues to be a hot-button issue.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future holds for the millions of children and young adults who have received these vaccinations, but for now, the shocking truth has been revealed.\n\nCovid-19 vaccination is doing far more harm than good.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Secret CDC Reports confirm 535k American Children & Young Adults have died since the FDA approved the COVID-19 Vaccine, resulting in a shocking 50% increase in Excess Deaths", "url": "https://expose-news.com/2023/03/05/cdc-535k-childred-dead-covid-vaccine/", "description": "A shocking report secretly released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has revealed that COVID-19 vaccines, touted as the solution to the alleged SARS-CoV-2 virus, may actually be causin\u2026", "article:published_time": "2023-03-05T06:59:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-04T19:36:36+00:00", "site_name": "The Expose", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/secret-cdc-535k-chilren.png?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Latest News"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=104676#", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-23.png?ssl=1", "https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=104676#", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-22.png?ssl=1", "https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=104676#", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-25.png?ssl=1", "https://expose-news.com/2023/02/23/uk-gov-cover-up-vaccinated-children-137x-likely-die/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/02/23/uk-gov-cover-up-vaccinated-children-137x-likely-die/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/planning/children.html", "https://expose-news.com/2022/05/01/cdc-study-covid-vaccine-risk-myocarditis-13200percent/", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-22.png?ssl=1", "https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=104676#", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-25.png?ssl=1", "https://expose-news.com/2023/02/23/uk-gov-cover-up-vaccinated-children-137x-likely-die/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/april-fundraising-campaign-2023/", "https://expose-news.com/asp-payment-box/?product_id=237456", "https://expose-news.com/asp-payment-box/?product_id=253886", "https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dailyexpose", "https://expose-news.com/donate-via-bank-transfer/", "https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/0e00a4d8-4c4a-43b1-8746-6e477dac325d", "t.me/dailyexpose", "https://gab.com/dailyexpose", "https://gettr.com/user/dailyexposegb", "https://expose-news.com/keep-up-with-the-expose/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/uks-emergency-alert-system-failed/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/uks-emergency-alert-system-failed/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/leaked-new-zealand-health-data/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/leaked-new-zealand-health-data/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/covid-jabs-have-created-millions-of-zombies/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/covid-jabs-have-created-millions-of-zombies/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/75-percent-did-not-die-from-covid/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/75-percent-did-not-die-from-covid/", "https://t.me/dailyexpose"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-03-05T06:59:00+00:00"}
