So far, the vaccines seem to be effective against these mutants, but it's very possible that others will continue to crop up, notes Leonard Krilov, MD, chairman of Pediatrics and chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease at NYU Langone Hospital\u2014Long Island.\n\nIt's also still unknown just what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated (or infected) to achieve herd immunity. \"Best guesses are 70 to 90 percent, which will be difficult to achieve, not just based on availability, but also on the extent of vaccine-hesitant individuals,\" Dr. Krilov says.\n\nWhat's more: While the FDA has granted the Pfizer vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for teens ages 12 to 15 and children as young as 5, the shot is still not yet available to those younger than 5 (Dr. Krilov estimates that might change in early to mid 2022).\n\nStill, being vaccinated (whether or not you've received a booster shot) does give you a little more freedom in your day-to-day. Here, doctors break down what you should and shouldn't do after getting the shot.\n\nThat's why you can now get together indoors sans masks with friends or family members outside of your household, and yes, even hug one another if you're all fully vaccinated. If a family member is not vaccinated, you can still hug them, as long as they're not at a higher risk for severe COVID.\n\nPer May 2021 CDC guidelines, fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask when they're outside \u2014 even at a crowded event with a lot of people, like a concert, sports game or parade \u2014 or in some indoor spaces, including movie theaters and restaurants with friends or family members from multiple households.\n\n\"This is because large gatherings can cause the virus to spread, which can lead to more mutations and variance,\" Niket Sonpal, MD, assistant professor of clinical medicine at Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in New York City, tells LIVESTRONG.com. \"This is true even if you have been vaccinated, as there is still a small chance of contraction.\"\n\nThat's why he recommends sharing factual information with your circle. Perhaps hearing why you chose to get vaccinated or what your experience was like getting the vaccine will encourage others to do the same.\n\n\"Many countries are not allowing the United States to enter, and moreover, vaccination is not a green card,\" Dr. Sonpal says. \"We want to give the health care institutions time to catch up and also give the scientists time to ensure that the new variants of COVID-19 are being neutralized by the current vaccinations.\"\n\nNote that if you do travel internationally, you'll still need to get a COVID test after returning to the U.S. even if you're fully vaccinated, but you won't need to self-quarantine, according to the CDC.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Experts break down what you should and shouldn't do after being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to keep yourself and others around you safe.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763795-what-can-you-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "title": "7 Dos and Don'ts for Life After Vaccination | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2F8e98b86b9fc24f60bff6c8943565d0bd.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731126-covid-variant-mutation/", "https://nyuwinthrop.org/faculty/leonard-r-krilov/", "/article/13727455-social-distancing-tips-seeing-loved-ones/", "/article/13727616-covid-19-test/", "/article/13731648-face-mask-guide-covid/", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13726454-herd-immunity-explained/", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-children-5-through-11-years-age", "https://go.skimresources.com?id=104860X1600559&xs=1&xcust=w_13763795&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-021-02532-4&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livestrong.com%2Farticle%2F13763795-what-can-you-do-after-covid-vaccine%2F", "/article/13727455-social-distancing-tips-seeing-loved-ones/", "/article/13727616-covid-19-test/", "/article/13731648-face-mask-guide-covid/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727561-how-to-wear-face-mask/", "https://tourocom.touro.edu/academics/faculty/harlem/niket-sonpal.php", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727616-covid-19-test/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html", "https://www.stonybrook.edu/experts/profile/sharon-nachman", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731143-what-to-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764018-foods-to-eat-after-vaccine/"], "authors": ["Jenn Sinrich", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/contentlab.studiod/profile/7/21/ecd258feefd7417382d0379c11d21749.jpg"], "publish_date": null}
