Jupiter visits the sign every 12 years, Saturn every 30. On the winter solstice (Dec 21, 2020) Jupiter formed a conjunction with Saturn. This meeting launched the start of a new twenty-year cycle of social/cultural, and economic growth. Jupiter/Saturn are also at the start of a new 200-year cycle, which is part of an even larger (800-year) cycle. Additionally, Jupiter/Saturn are synchronizing to the much bigger clock, that of a coming new world age. Sounds like a big deal, you say? It is. Jupiter in Aquarius is a signature for social movements and trends, for the modernizing of schools of thought and our everyday reality. To the plus, it is a fresh stimulus or enlivening influence. Following on the heels of all the negativity, depression, fear and pessimism that a Capricorn transit can hold, Jupiter in Aquarius, a fresh air, or saving grace influence, can offer welcome respite. This transit can hold fresh hope, inspiration, and opportunity. It can create a buoyancy effect or bounce back we haven\u2019t seen in a while. Certainly, there\u2019s a lot of hopefulness pinned on the new USA administration, the newly forged Brexit agreement, and the vaccine rollout. Jupiter will spend most of this year in Aquarius (with a short dip into Pisces waters from mid May to the end of June). Saturn in Aquarius will be with us to 2023. Jupiter aims to point the way forward, to show us where opportunity lies. Saturn in Aquarius looks to fix the cracks and potholes, or to scrap the old road and build an entirely new one. While the process of getting a better fix on the new reality and its requirements takes time, Saturn in Aquarius will speed the cementing process along. The year ahead sets us onto a faster track, this regarding the establishing of new reality baselines, a new format for everyday living, and the solidifying of a new structure of consciousness. When it comes to inclusivity, equality, caring for our elders and our young ones, and justice for all, it\u2019s high time we re-invented our moral compass! Neptune, continuing in dynamic (square) aspect to the karmic axis, is a key signature for the second wave pandemic spike and for the mutational strains that have recently caught our attention. Apparently, such viruses are typically mutational. Once again, the astrology agrees with the science. Continue to stay vigilant regarding your health. According to Neptune, the exposure threat continues to stay heightened through the end of January and well into February. Mars has spent the past six months transiting Aries. It\u2019s been quite a fight, wouldn\u2019t you agree? As of January 6 (to March 4), Mars takes up residency in Taurus. While in this sign, Mars looks for something more substantial to have and to hold, for more worthy investments of time, heart, or money. Mars in Taurus sets a fertile and lucrative backdrop. It also finds value in quality over quantity, over slow, steady, and sustained, rather than the overnight one hit wonder. While this can be a gain-better-ground transit, Mars will not be up to full steam until it surpasses Saturn on January 13 and teams up with Uranus (conjunction) on January 21. (Also setting the backdrop for significant progress and reinvention mandates, Uranus ends retrograde on January 14.) Coinciding with Biden\u2019s presidential inauguration on January 20, Mars conjunct Uranus infuse new initiatives with a more dynamic life force. Together, Mars/Uranus launches a next 19-month cycle focused on net worth, self worth, and survival matters. January 22, Mars gains extra turbo from Jupiter. Watch this week for added intensity and significant action regarding money markets, crypto currency, and such. (Covid numbers and the weather could be notable too.) Venus enters Capricorn and Mercury enters Aquarius on January 8. Both transits set a helpful/lucrative backdrop for putting ambition and ingenuity into play, for exploring/finding new avenues and options.

There\u2019s more opportunity for the taking than we have heard from the chicken little folks. It is up to you to go out there and meet your life head on. There are three action peaks of the month: January 8 to 14, January 19 to 22, and January 26 to 30. I\u2019ve discussed the first two peaks in the previous paragraphs. The last week of the month hosts a full moon in Leo on January 28. We will feel the energy a few days prior. The Leo full moon is accompanied by a sun/Jupiter and a Venus/Pluto conjunction. It could be a turning point of significance for matters of heart or wallet. Watch for something or someone special to claim spotlight attention.

A birth or a pregnancy brings cause for celebration. Nothing is small or insignificant about this \u201ctake flight\u201d or catch the wave full moon. There could be a major announcement, a special event (the Grammy awards show happens Jan 31), significant trend or big wheels set into motion, a powerplay of note, an instant success story, overnight fame, a big prize won, sudden/surprise opportunity, a life-altering moment. A speculative venture could see a pay-off. Trading and stocks are likely to hit a surge track, there\u2019s sure to be plenty of political action too.
