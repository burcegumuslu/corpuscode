They lead families, communities, businesses, and governments. That has always been their role throughout history. When men become effete, the society collapses. In America this indispensable resource is being destroyed.\n\nIt begins with boys, which means they never become men. I remember when boys were trained for leadership. They received more discipline and were given more independence than girls, who were trained for nurture and motherhood. The roles of the sexes were as distinct as the sexes. There was no such thing as a girl who wanted to be a boy or a boy who wanted to be a girl. Transgenderism is an invention of a sick and dying society.\n\nEverything related to becoming a man has been banned. School playground fights, today an excuse to call police and arrest children, were part of growing up. Sports were where you developed confidence as you learned to catch a high fly, field a grounder, throw a strike, hit a single or a home run. Boys were encouraged. They had their own space, sandlot teams, Little League, Boy Scouts. They had after school jobs\u2013newspaper routes, bagging groceries, cutting lawns, washing cars. Girls developed cooking skills, sewing skills, artistic skills, chaste demeanor. None of this meant that women were barred from professional lives. They were authors, Registered Nurses, accountants, para-legals, teachers, scientists, scholars.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2023/04/06/the-destruction-of-the-american-male/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
