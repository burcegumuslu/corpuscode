From early March 2020, when the FLCCC team of physicians first came together to study and create treatment protocols for fighting the novel disease, the team, guided by Dr. G. Umberto Meduri\u2019s expertise in corticosteroid use, placed methylprednisolone at the head \u2014 as the \u201cM\u201d \u2014 in its MATH+ hospital treatment formula. As a result, the two hospitals using the MATH+ formula had mortality rates of no higher than 6%, when most hospitals lost as many as 80% of their seriously ill COVID patients. This was months before the landmark RECOVERY trial convinced world authorities to allow and advocate for the use of steroids in treating the inflammatory stage of the disease. Publications listed below range from large scale observational studies demonstrating large impacts on mortality in the prior pandemics of SARS and H1N1, through the landmark RECOVERY trial done in the United Kingdom against COVID-19, to numerous and increasing COVID-19 retrospective cohort studies published from Italy, China, Spain, and the United States. In addition, a scientific review of the evidence supporting methylprednisolone in COVID-19 authored by FLCCC Alliance member Dr. G. Umberto Meduri can be found here.\n\nJun 1, 2021\n\n Is Methylprednisolone Better than Dexamethasone for Severe COVID-19?\n\n Daniel D.
