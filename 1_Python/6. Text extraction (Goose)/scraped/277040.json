Vaccines have took us two years to be in oversupply. Today, there are more vaccines than there is demand for vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Gates is obviously referring to the slow roll out of vaccines to countries in Africa and elsewhere, those who have made vast profits from vaccines and regular boosters are also likely to be \u2018sad\u2019 that Omicron has provided massive natural immunity.\n\nThat includes companies like Pfizer, who as FDA Executive Officer Christopher Cole recently admitted, have a \u201cmoney incentive\u201d to to \u201cpromote additional vaccinations.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have shown that being infected with COVID provides far superior natural immunity than the vaccine itself.\n\nThe Times of Israel previously reported on how natural immunity provided Israelis with \u201clonger-lasting Delta defense than vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe variant was 27 times more likely to break through Pfizer protection from January-February and cause symptoms than it was to penetrate natural immunity from the same period,\u201d reported the newspaper.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
