The most powerful cults are those built on kernels of truth and helpful spiritual techniques and wisdom. That's what justifies the abuse and makes the cult so sticky. P.S. Is it possible for a man to orgasm as a woman? Absolutely! And vice versa. But that's a topic for another day.\n\nNotice the subtle ways in which ideology gets programmed into young mind. This is the core problem facing mankind. P.S. My point in showing you this clip is meta. I am not interested in a debate about pro or anti abortion. Your personal views on abortion are irrelevant to me. I am interested in having you learn how ideology of any kind gets programmed into the mind and why it is deeply problematic. Content vs Structure. This is not a problem limited to conservatives, although it is extremely widespread among conservatives.\n\nThe topic of understanding war and conflict is actually deeply spiritual and of upmost importance to study. People seriously misunderstand why war and conflict occurs. To truly understand conflict requires an existential, meta perspective free of all self-bias \u2014 this is a task that few human minds are epistemicly equipped for. I'll have some profound videos about it in the future. In the meantime, it would be wise of you to contemplate the question deeply for yourself: Why does conflict occur within reality at all? What is its existential source?\n\nNow THIS Is Survival! If you want to understand survival and corruption, study the situation in Mexico: This is how most human beings on the planet used to survive. Those of us who live in 1st world democracies simply have no clue what survival really means. BTW, the majority of countries around the world are corrupt in similar fashion as Mexico. Which shows you just how much Spiral development mankind as a whole has left to do. Most people, including I would say the guys behind Spiral Dynamics, overestimate how developed mankind is. We are less developed than we think. Mankind as a whole is nowhere near stage Green, let alone Tier 2. There will not be a Tier 2 to an significant degree in our lifetime. Most of mankind is struggling to reach Blue and Orange. Appreciate the scope of the problem.\n\nRead this crazy story of how the Covid vaccine microchip conspiracy theory was birthed: It is a strange paradox that as mankind evolves it also gets stupider. Some ideas are so stupid they actually become more believable because people figure: \"Well... this would be so wrong if it wasn't true, so it must be true because there's no way I could be so stupid as to believe something so wrong.\" I will repeat the opening statement of my video on The Sneaky Psychology Behind Conspiracy Theories: \"Conspiracy theories are a dumb person's idea of intelligence.\" The funny thing about conspiracy theorists is that they think they are being freethinkers and nonconformists when in fact they are engaged in peak conformity and group-think. It's the paradox of the nonconforming conformists. Self-deception 101. None of this is to say that selfishness and devilry doesn't run rampant in the world. It certainly does. Selfishness is the true conspiracy from which popular conspiracy theories are mere distractions and false flags. If you want to investigate a real conspiracy, look at how selfishly you, your friends, your family, and your colleagues behave while patting each other on the back and reassuring yourselves that you're angels. Human society is a conspiracy of selfishness.\n\nAfter some delay due to my gut health problems, I got my first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine yesterday at my local Walgreens. The whole process took 15 minutes. The shot itself took 1 minute. The other 14 minutes was just waiting for the staff. There was no line. The shot was completely painless. 24 hours later I feel no different than normal. I have a little soreness in my arm where I got the shot. No mark or scar. The needle they use is so tiny you don't even feel it go in. Overall, it's so easy. Go get your vaccine today. Don't let people fearmonger to you with conspiracy theories and fake news. Your odds of dying from Covid are hundreds of times higher than having a complication from the vaccine. So you'd be a fool not get vaccinated. Not to even mention the collective social costs of not getting vaccinated for the global economy and the people you could kill by being an unwitting carrier for the virus. Neither the Pfizer nor the Moderna vaccines contain heavy metals like old fashioned vaccines do, eliminating even that minor risk factor. My Mom and brother both got both doses of the Moderna vaccine and they had no significant side-effects. The vaccine is also FREE! If you're in the USA, you can schedule a free appointment via the Walgreens website. Or your favorite pharmacy center. Don't doubt, don't delay, go get vaccinated today! And be thankful that such a painless, healthy, and effective vaccine exists at all. The fearmongering and lack of gratitude has gotten way out of hand. Yet another example of the madness of crowds.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "615", "height": "345", "embed_code":
