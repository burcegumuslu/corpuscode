School Districts Lying to Parents by Stating all Students Must be Fully Vaccinated when State Law Provides Exemptions\n\nHealth Freedom Idaho is reporting that school districts throughout Idaho are sending threatening letters to parents and falsely claiming that their children must be fully vaccinated or they will not be able to be enrolled in school. Idaho State law actually allows for vaccine exemptions for religious and medical reasons. (Source.) One concerned mom in Idaho writes: \"I was registering my son for kindergarten today (his only partial year of public school before he will be homeschooled). I noticed this passage and the way it was worded when I was filling out his registration paperwork. I came with his vaccine exemption form in hand already filled out, which they accepted. I was really bothered by the fact that we have the right to waive vaccines, and yet they write to parents that by law they have to have their vaccinations. This is wrong. They should say something like, 'It is Idaho State Law that you must have complete immunization records or an Idaho School Immunization Exemption Form to register your child for school.' I listened to moms coming in worried that they didn\u2019t have vaccination records and the school never gave them the option to waive. If it is our right to waive, why is this not disclosed as part of proper informed consent?\"", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Medicine Watch", "Headline"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://healthimpactnews.com/2019/no-shots-no-school-not-true-school-districts-lying-to-parents-by-stating-all-students-must-be-fully-vaccinated-when-state-law-provides-exemptions/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
