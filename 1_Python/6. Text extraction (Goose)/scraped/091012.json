Dr McCann shared the shocking revelation in her address at the Covid Vaccine Conference, hosted by Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party over the weekend in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. The event featured leading ICU physician Dr. Pierre Kory, cardiologist and epidemiologist Dr. Peter McCullough, and McCullough\u2019s collaborator, author John Leake.\n\n\n\nAddressing sold-out crowds, Dr. McCann shared the extraordinary lengths she had to go to to extract causality assessment documents relating to the TGA\u2019s investigation of reported deaths after Covid vaccination, which were obtained under FOI request in a process that took six months. Dr McCann lodged the request after seeing an unexpectedly high number of patients coming through her clinic experiencing adverse events after immunisation (AEFIs). She also noticed a high number of serious AEFI reports in the in the DAEN database, including the reported death of a 14 year-old in October 2021.\n\nIn her original FOI request, Dr. McCann requested causality assessments for all of the reported deaths in the DAEN database. This request was denied due to the large scope, and in negotiation with the TGA, Dr. McCann agreed to revise down the request to the 11 documents that were eventually handed over, of which 10 related to DAEN death reports.\n\nWhen the documents were finally provided to Dr. McCann in July 2022, she was dismayed to find that there were multiple reports that the TGA had assessed as causally linked to Covid vaccination, but, with the exception of one death, had not been reported in the TGA\u2019s regular Safety Reports.\n\nFollowing is a list of deaths that the TGA\u2019s own reports assessed as causally linked to Covid vaccination:\n\n21 year-old female\n\nCase 729139, Document 1\n\nModerna booster. Fatal AEFIs, including myocarditis, cardiac arrest, renal impairment, femoral artery embolism, spinal cord infarction.\n\nAssessment outcome: \u201cCausal\u201d\n\n * Initially determined as \u201cunclassifiable\u201d. VSIG (FOI 4049 Doc 5) updated the assessment outcome to \u201ccausal\u201d.\n\nOf the above five listed deaths, only the first (21 year old female, case 729139) has been published in the TGA Safety Reports, having been added on September 13th 2022. The reported deaths are listed in DAEN, but the causality assessment is not visible to the public.\n\nAustralians have been falsely and misleadingly advised by the TGA and official health representatives that out of 973 reported deaths, only 14 have been assessed as being causally linked to the Covid vaccines (13 following Astra Zeneca, one following Moderna).\n\nThe causality assessment reports released under FOI prove this statement to be a lie.\n\nThe November 2022 TGA Safety Report states that, \u201cThere have been no deaths in children or adolescents determined to be linked to COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d But the assessment reports indicating the causal role of the Pfizer vaccine in the cases of the seven and nine year-old children were released to Dr. McCann in July 2022.\n\nThe causality assessment reports prove this statement also to be a lie.\n\nOn reading the causality assessments provided to her under the FOI, Dr. McCann felt both shocked and confused. \u201cWhy has this information not been provided to health professionals and the public who are making consent decisions? Children are continuing to be vaccinated and this is something that parents deserve to be able to weigh up,\u201d Dr. McCann told .\n\nIt gets worse. Dr. McCann was surprised to find that documents 1-10 out of a total 11 documents from the FOI had not been uploaded to the TGA\u2019s public disclosure log, per regular protocol. She emailed the TGA to query why documents 1-10 had been withheld from the disclosure log, and was advised, in a communication on August 24th 2022:\n\n\n\nThe TGA seems to have assumed that families of the deceased will not want to hear from them. On the contrary, Deb, mother of 21 year-old Natalie (case 729139), told Jab Injuries Australia that the lack of contact from the TGA was, \u201cdisgraceful treatment of a grieving mother who could have made a meaningful contribution to their investigations\u201d. Deb says that she has never been contacted by the TGA, and only discovered the causality assessment outcome of her daughter\u2019s death via the TGA\u2019s Safety Report (September 23rd 2022), which she accessed online.\n\nAs for the TGA\u2019s assertion that disclosure of the documents could undermine public confidence, one could very well argue the opposite case. Perceived lack of transparency drives public distrust. The last thing the TGA needs is public suspicion that it is burying vaccine deaths. Full transparency is the only way to create and maintain trust in public health. Dr. McCann made this argument in a further communication, but the TGA\u2019s decision against uploading documents 1-10 to the public disclosure log was final.\n\nDuring this time, Dr. McCann, in partnership with other concerned doctors, repeatedly wrote to the Health Ministers and Adjunct Professor John Skerritt of the TGA to advise them of concerns about vaccine safety, and to call for immediate suspension of the vaccine rollout until an urgent review of adverse event reports could be undertaken.\n\nThese correspondences were met alternately with silence, obfuscation or blanket assurances that the TGA was closely monitoring safety, and that the vaccines were safe and effective.\n\nThe TGA consistently reports that only 14 of the 973 reported deaths have been causally linked to vaccination. But the contents of FOI 3727 raise questions:\n\u2022 How can the TGA\u2019s statement be true? The TGA\u2019s own causality assessments indicate that there are at least four more deaths that TGA has causally linked to vaccination (two adults, two children) which remain unaccounted for in the official count of 14.\n\u2022 How many of the 959 deaths that the TGA implies are not causally linked to vaccination have even been investigated? Are 900 reports \u2018in progress\u2019? How many have been determined as \u2018not causally linked\u2019? Dr. McCann asked the TGA to state the number of causality assessment reports that had been completed, but her request was denied.\n\nDr. McCann is concerned about the implications for public health and safety: \u201cIf everyone is working on the basis that all of these deaths have been investigated and have been determined as not causally linked, well we can\u2019t be sure that that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor now, Dr. McCann is turning her efforts to a Covid Vaccine Class Action, which is expected to file within the month. The Class Action has received over 350 expressions of interest, and the number is still growing.\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully this class action will force some transparency so that there will be more clarity around how adverse events are reviewed, and how many are likely to be linked to the vaccines,\u201d says Dr McCann.\n\nYesterday, Federal MP Russell Broadbent added further pressure to the TGA, referring to Dr. McCann\u2019s FOI 3727 in Parliament: \u201cWhy has the TGA not responded to doctors who raised these issues with you six months ago, including drawing your attention to those case reports? This information is extremely alarming and demands an immediate response from the TGA.\u201d\n\nSydney lawyer Tony Nikolic, of AFL Solicitors, has represented parents of children who are disputing the necessity of having their child vaccinated against Covid, and is now seeing cases related to Covid vaccine injury in children as well. Mr. Nikolic told :\n\n\n\nAustralian parents who have concerns that their child has been vaccine injured or is subject to coercion to take a Covid vaccine are invited to contact Mr. Nikolic.\n\n\n\nThe TGA has been contacted for comment.\n\nThis article first appeared on Rebekah Barnett\u2019s Substack page, Dystopian Down Under.\n\nUPDATE: The TGA has responded to Rebekah\u2019s request for comment.
