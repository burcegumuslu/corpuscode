Because as they state, these medical conditions have been associated with severe COVID-19 \u201cand vaccines in general.\u201d In other words, vaccines in general, historically, have carried enormous risk and dangers over an incredibly wide area of medical conditions. This is a key confession.\n\nFurther, if you read the full secret Pfizer document, you will come to Table 7, which does list a number of categories of adverse reactions, all of which WERE reported in the first three months of the Pfizer vaccine rollout. This IS stunning.\n\nIn the secret document, Pfizer does list 1,223 deaths occurring after just three months of the vaccine rollout. This should have been sufficient to cause a complete halt to the vaccination program.\n\nFinally, Pfizer admits that in the first three months of the vaccine rollout, it logged a staggering 42,086 cases of adverse reactions. And as far as I can determine from the Pfizer document, these 42,086 cases represented a total of 139,888 adverse events. In other words, in many cases, there were reports of multiple adverse events.\n\nJournalist Celia Farber just wrote an explosive article on the Pfizer secret document. You should read it (and her addendum, here). She deserves our thanks and gratitude. And here you can also read the document itself.\n\nIn short, the Pfizer document (which was never supposed to see the light of day but was disclosed as part of a FOIA suit) describes the adverse effects from just the first three months of injections with the company\u2019s COVID vaccine:\n\n158,000 adverse events, 1,223 deaths. In a half-sane world, this would have been more than enough to halt all injections and cancel the vaccine.\n\nI\u2019ve queried two attorneys. They both looked at the Pfizer document and state they believe it\u2019s authentic.\n\nThe appendix of the Pfizer document is the most astonishing section. It\u2019s beyond astonishing. It lists all the types of vaccine adverse events Pfizer logged\u2014again, in just three months of injections.\n\nPage after page after page after page of types of adverse events. Each type of event cast in medical language, the language of the dead. The proponents of this technical-ese speak, as it were, from beyond the grave. They\u2019re super-educated brainwashed zombies. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re listing and counting abstractions in an academic board game.\n\nThe abstractions raise no concerns. In the document, no one is waving red flags. They\u2019re all medical bean counters, keeping their books with precision.\n\nMake no mistake, these are the people who are operating the levers of society on a day-to-day basis, maiming and killing with a confident attitude that indicates they are beyond reproach. The very notion of reproach is foreign to them.\n\nCivilization is drowning. It\u2019s drowning in a giant lake of TECHNIQUE. The uses to which technique is put have become irrelevant. Just follow procedure. Carry out assigned tasks. Pass along information. Report on results. And then you will have achieved immunity from blame.\n\nOr resist and rebel no matter what. These are the stakes. This is the war.\n\nGet ready. Buckle up.
