This blockage can alter tissue functioning and trigger autoimmune disease, as well as cause abnormal bleeding or clotting, including jab-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.\n\nIvermectin, hydroxychloroquine (with zinc), quercetin (with zinc), and fisetin (a flavonoid) all help to protect ACE2 receptors from being flooded with damaging spike proteins.\n\nCovid injections also trigger a spike in interleukin 6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine. The following substances may help to detox and remedy this situation:\n\nBoswellia serrata (frankincense)\n\n Black cumin (Nigella sativa)\n\n Krill oil and other fatty acids\n\n Fisetin\n\n Quercetin\n\n Luteolin\n\n Zinc\n\n Jasmine tea\n\n Bay leaves\n\n Nutmeg\n\n Dandelion leaf extract\n\n Curcumin\n\n Cinnamon\n\n Apigenin\n\n Resveratrol\n\n Vitamin D3 (with vitamin K)\n\n Magnesium\n\n Spices\n\n Black pepper\n\n Sage\n\nIn order to gain entry into your cells, SARS-CoV-2 must first bind to either an ACE2 or CD147 receptor on the cell. The spike protein subunit must then be proteolytically cleaved, or cut \u2013 without this cleavage, the virus would simply attach to the receptor and stop there.\n\nIt turns out that SARS-CoV-2 has a novel furin cleavage site that is not present in natural coronaviruses, which is why many believe it was created in a laboratory. Some powerful natural furin inhibitors include:\n\nSerine protease is another enzyme that is \u201cresponsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, enabling host cell fusion of the virus.\u201d Inhibiting serine protease could help to prevent spike protein activation and viral entry into cells, which can be done with the following foods and substances:\n\nEating healthy and restricting when you eat helps the immune system to naturally detoxify spike proteins\n\nAs you probably noticed, many of the above remedies are foods. All you have to do is eat them and your body takes care of the rest. (Related: Broccoli and especially broccoli sprouts have been shown to repair spike protein damage throughout the body.)\n\nWith that said, cutting out processed and other pro-inflammatory foods is a great place to start in ridding your body of spike proteins and other jab toxins. This includes cutting out vegetable (seed) oils, many of which are highly refined and highly inflammatory.\n\nRestricting when you eat to a six- to eight-hour window, also known as time-restricted eating, is also helpful because it has been shown to improve mitochondrial health and metabolic flexibility.\n\nTime-restricted eating also increases autophagy, an important process by which your body vacuums up and cleans out damaged cells. WCH explains it like this:\n\n\u201cThis method \u2026 is used to induce autophagy, which is essentially a recycling process that takes place in human cells, where cells degrade and recycle components. Autophagy is used by the body to eliminate damaged cell proteins and can destroy harmful viruses and bacteria post-infection.\u201d\n\nUsing a sauna, preferably with infrared capability, is another powerful way to rid your body of toxins while increasing longevity. The heat stress from a sauna increases plasma volume and blood flow to the heart and muscles, which in turn increases athletic endurance.\n\nSauna-induced heat shock also increases muscle mass by enhancing protein uptake and the production of human growth hormone (HGH).\n\nIf you need a simpler place to start on the diet front, WCH recommends adding the following 10 essential compounds to your health strategy:\n\nIt is also highly recommended that you check out the full WCH spike protein detox guide for specific dosage information. This is especially important for ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, as both of these are pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nBe sure to read the dosage information for the natural remedies as well since it is based on optimal therapeutic potential.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom. The news also serves as a social connection tool, as we tend to relate to those who know about and believe the things we do. With the power of an open truth-seeking mind in hand, the individual can grow wise and the collective can prosper.\n\nNot sure how to make sense of this? Want to learn how to discern like a pro?
