Boyce, Executive Vice President of Health and Biomedical Sciences Katrina Armstrong, and Senior Executive Vice President Gerald M. Rosberg issued the announcement that Columbia dropped the mandate for students, faculty, and other members of the university community.\n\nProof of vaccination\u2013including for visitors to the university\u2013is no longer needed, though the university community is still strongly encouraged to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\n\nPositive tests for COVID-19 do not have to be submitted to Columbia. Instead, the university community is encouraged to follow CDC guidelines and the advice of a physician after testing positive.\n\n[RELATED: REPORT: Community college changes course to comply with state\u2019s vaccine mandate]\n\nColumbia cited the declining case counts in New York City and nationwide as part of its justification for lifting its vaccine mandate.\n\nIn New York, responses to Biden\u2019s declaration on the state of emergency are mixed. The Rochester Institute of Technology joined Columbia by recently dropping its vaccine mandate, while the State University System of New York (SUNY) still requires them for students but not faculty, according to the New York Post.\n\nDuring the fall 2022 semester, colleges and universities engaged in a fierce debate over whether they should still require masking and vaccination as campuses continued policies that exceeded CDC guidelines.\n\nThat same semester, colleges and universities also required students to receive booster vaccines, sometimes issuing punishments such as barring noncompliant students from enrollment or expelling them.\n\nCampus Reform contacted all relevant parties listed for comment and will update this article accordingly.\n\nSarah Prentice is a Political Science Major at SUNY Brockport, where she is a Campus Reform Correspondent, the President of Turning Point USA, and a Young Women for America Ambassador.
