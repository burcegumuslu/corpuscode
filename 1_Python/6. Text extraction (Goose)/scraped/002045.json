The two big Paris hospitals that received him refused to start the treatment (without it being explained in detail) if the patient refused the experimental injection, of absolutely unknown effects on the development of cancers.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 justification? None: \u201cthat\u2019s the way it is\u201d, and we have accepted it!\n\nSilence on the colleagues suspended for lack of obedience and even more on the objective reasons that made them prefer to lose their jobs, their remuneration, their houses, their families intolerant to these decisions as well, rather than submit to the presidential ukase to accept experimental drugs\u2026\n\nWould more than three hundred thousand caregivers (a figure that is probably highly underestimated given the number of hospitals and clinics currently forced to close beds and postpone interventions due to lack of personnel) be crazy, conspiratorial or delusional to the point of putting themselves in great personal, social, family, professional and psychological danger?\n\nHave the doctors who claim that vaccination is safe taken the time to look at the statistics of the effects reported and accepted by the official agencies? Are the FDA, EMA, MHRA also \u201cconspiratorial\u201d when they release statistics as in the case of VAERS, which is entity of the CDC:\n\nMore than 726,000 Covid vaccine-related adverse events reported to VAERS as CDC and FDA overturn advisory committee recommendations on Pfizer\u2019s third vaccine.\n\nVAERS data released by the CDC included a total of 726,965 adverse event reports from all age groups following Covid vaccines, including 15,386 deaths and 99,410 serious complications between December 14, 2020, and September 17, 2021.[1]\n\nOr Eudra Vigilance pharmacovigilance body of the European Medicines Agency\n\nOr even the ANSM, our French agency, which shows more than 1200 deaths accepted as at least possibly related to these experimental injections.\n\nAll therapeutic trials for fifty years were stopped after a few deaths for investigation (53 deaths stopped the H1N1 vaccine). Here, thousands of deaths throughout the world and children are shamelessly attacked[2]. How can we continue to believe that this is a health policy?\n\nWhy this denial of the most solid sects on the part of theoretically educated doctors, capable of obtaining information directly from reliable sources and equipped with a brain?\n\nFear of the boss, of the director, who in a few months\u2019 time will inevitably be called into question, since many countries are backtracking and even Germany wants to get out of vaccine terrorism, perhaps on the occasion of Mrs Merkel\u2019s departure[3].\n\n\u201cThe leading organizations of contracted physicians in Germany are demanding an immediate end to the \u201canti-corona\u201d measures and an end to the \u201chorror rhetoric and panic politics\u201d. Obviously, French hospital doctors in Paris and elsewhere do not read German newspapers and are terrorized by the threats of their professional association, their minister, and become kapos[4] and terrorize their patients.\n\nMore and More Testimonies are Coming In\n\nWhatever their unacceptable reasons, testimonies are multiplying.\n\nA young girl accompanies her friend to her mother\u2019s funeral\u2026 such a mother, mother of a high school friend, 34 years old, in remission from breast cancer for two years, who is injected with the vaccine and collapses a few days later in a coma and dies after three days of hospitalization\u2026 Politically correct explanation: the cancer exploded and took her away. Close the chapter and the coffin.\n\nWhat would Maigret have said? [Historic Police Investigator]\n\nBut too many coincidences shock the police investigators in front of a corpse. Only doctors would not have the right to think about coincidences of time, for example: \u201ctemporality\u201d is their key word\u2026\n\nLike the misleading slogan, \u201cthe numbers are always right\u201d. Yes, if they are true and observed in the real world.\n\nBut how much confidence can we have in the rigged simulations that the government and the media feed us without ever specifying that they are only predictions or estimates? 5] But one can do what one wants with the figures, when one chooses them, or creates them to justify the chosen hypothesis, and the the results are totally blurred.\n\nIn any case, as far as \u201ccancer and gene injection\u201d is concerned, the vagueness unfortunately dissipates in front of the multitude of terrible stories.\n\nFrom the colleague who sees multiple \u201cballs\u201d appearing under her armpits, which the check-ups in the hospital do not explain\u2026 Obviously no possible link with the vax. And yet the ganglions that appear some time after the injection are a frequent observation after these vax.\n\nSo clearly there seems to be three situations:\n\u2022 The appearance of a cancer rapidly after the injection (two weeks to a few months) and very progressive, in a person who was previously free of known carcinological pathologies.\n\u2022 The resumption of cancer in a patient who has been in complete remission for several months or years.\n\u2022 The rapid, even explosive, evolution of a cancer that is not yet controlled.\n\nBeyond the testimonies that are pouring in from relatives and friends and on social networks, a Swiss newspaper has finally addressed the subject in a broader way.\n\nHere are some excerpts from their article[6] and their references[7]:\n\nThus the authors conclude that it is quite possible that these immune changes could have unintended consequences on the condition of the recipient of the gene injection. A matter of common sense indeed!\n\nPost-vaccination reactivation of latent viral infections, including shingles virus, EBV (Epstein-Barr) and hepatitis virus, has also been observed.\n\nThere are already a few thousand observations in official adverse event reporting and online patient groups. There are certainly true coincidences or diagnostic delays due to delayed diagnosis related to containment. But we should not dismiss the huge problems that these real people affected in their daily lives and even more the responsibility that cancer doctors take by imposing the injection before any treatment or protocol continuation. Their main argument: \u201cwe did it right, without discussion\u201d does not seem worthy of a once thoughtful profession.\n\nIn August 2021, Dr. Ryan Cole,[8] an American pathologist for many years, described a significant increase in certain types of cancer (e.g. endometrial cancer, uterine cancer) since the beginning of the covid mass vaccination campaign. More recently, German pathologists have also noted the problem of post-vaccination immune dysregulation and sudden tumor growth in some patients.\n\nOn the French networks, several testimonies coincide with the reappearance of vaginal hemorrhages in women over 85 years of age leading to the diagnosis of endometrial cancer and rapid death\u2026 The spike protein produced by the body following the injection is particularly attracted to the genitals, and this would be a new demonstration of this.\n\nSo until we know more, let\u2019s be careful, both doctors and caregivers, and not play the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice!\n\nCaution is required with all experimental treatments and even more so when they are the result of a technique never used before in infectious pathology. First, do no harm must guide the decisions of any physician faithful to his Hippocratic oath.\n\nDr. Nicole Del\u00e9pine: Pediatrician, oncologist, former head of the pediatric oncology department at the R Poincar\u00e9 Garches Hospital APHP France\n\nWebsite www.docteurnicoledelepine.fr and ametist.org for the defense of children with cancer\n\n[1] More Than 726,000 COVID Vaccine Injuries Reported to VAERS as CDC, FDA Overrule Advisory Committees\u2019 Recommandations on Third Pfizer Shot\n\u2022 Children\u2019s Health Defense (childrenshealthdefense.org)\n\n[3] Les m\u00e9decins lib\u00e9raux allemands pour la fin de \u00ab la politique de la panique \u00bb\n\n le 27/09/2021 Dr Stephan Hofmeister, Dr Andreas Gassen, Dr Thomas Kriedel\n\n KBV Lopata/axentis.de France-Soir\n\n Les principales organisations de m\u00e9decins conventionn\u00e9s en Allemagne exigent la fin imm\u00e9diate des mesures \u00ab anti-corona \u00bb et la fin de \u00ab la rh\u00e9torique de l\u2019horreur et la politique de la panique \u00bb.\n\n Lors de la convention des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s des m\u00e9decins conventionn\u00e9s allemands, le directeur adjoint de la Kassen\u00e4rztlichen Bundesvereinigung (KBV, association nationale des m\u00e9decins de l\u2019assurance maladie) le Dr Stephan Hofmeister, et le pr\u00e9sident, le Dr Andreas Gassen, ont exig\u00e9 la fin des mesures dites \u00ab anti-Corona \u00bb en Allemagne et la fin de la \u00ab politique de la panique et la rh\u00e9torique de l\u2019horreur \u00bb.\n\n Le communiqu\u00e9 de presse de la KBV d\u00e9clare : \u00ab tous ceux qui souhaitent se faire vacciner ont la possibilit\u00e9 de le faire.
