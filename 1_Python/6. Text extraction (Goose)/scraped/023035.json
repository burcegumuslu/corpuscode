Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) has been demanding answers from federal health wonks whose silence is approaching pandemic proportions. The two-term senior senator from the Badger State recently sent separate letters to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky \u201crequesting information about whether the agency performed sufficient surveillance of Covid-19 vaccine adverse events\u201d and inquiring why the CDC spent almost half a million tax dollars to track millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cA recent article noted that [the] CDC did not compile all of the data on vaccine adverse events it initially claimed it would,\u201d Johnson wrote in a June 27, 2022, letter to Walensky.\n\nVAERS refers to the federal program where healthcare workers can report suspected adverse events from vaccinations, though these are rarely followed-up on and confirmed by health authorities.\n\nAccording to Johnson, the CDC \u201creportedly failed to provide these tables and other surveillance data in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,\u201d even while the CDC oddly claimed, \u201cno information was withheld from [the FOIA] release.\u201d\n\nJohnson shot back: \u201cThis raises questions about whether [the] CDC ever collected the information on vaccine safety it originally claimed it would in the Jan. 2021 SOP.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the senator called on the agency to \u201cexplain why, and detail who, made the decision to not follow the SOP and when that decision was made,\u201d according to Johnson\u2019s office.\n\nIn his other letter, dated May 5, Johnson queried Walensky about the agency\u2019s \u201creported use of location data to monitor Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report by \u201cVICE,\u201d an alternative media platform, which includes firsthand CDC data as a source, the CDC paid one company $420,000 to access location data \u201cfrom at least 20 million active cellphone users per day\u201d to examine Americans\u2019 activities in schools, places of worship, parks, grocery stores, and public transit stations, as Johnson related in his letter.\n\nIt remains unclear why the CDC tracked millions of Americans during the pandemic and whether it continues to do so. The CDC \u201cshould have been prioritizing the development of treatments, effective testing, and vaccine safety rather than tracking Americans\u2019 daily lives,\u201d Johnson wrote.\n\nAs discussed during an Oct. 22, 2020, teleconference on vaccine surveillance systems, \u201ca CDC official noted that [the] CDC and [the] FDA planned to use VAERS to conduct data mining \u2026 every one to two weeks,\u201d Johnson\u2019s letter noted. That official praised VAERS, stating that it can \u201crapidly detect safety signals and can detect rare adverse events,\u201d Johnson noted, adding:\n\nAccording to the independent website OpenVAERS.com, based on federal Health and Human Services data, there had been 29,162 \u201cvaccine reported deaths\u201d just in the U.S. through June 24, along with 2,191,497 reported adverse vaccine effects and 165,213 total reported Covid-19 vaccine-related hospitalizations in the U.S.\n\nHowever, relatively small percentages of patients and doctors, if they\u2019re aware of VAERS at all, take the time to report vaccine reactions, actual or suspected, in the first place.\n\nMeanwhile, in the immediate wake of Pfizer/BioNTech receiving the dubious permission of the FDA to include babies, toddlers, and children, ages 6 months to four years, in the Covid-19 vaccination campaign, the Crimes Against Humanity Tour USA, whose organizers are seeking justice about Covid-related crimes, is growing. At press time, the traveling conference had visited seven cities: Los Angeles May 1, Chicago May 8, Phoe\u00adnix May 14, Houston May 21, Minneapolis May 28, Dallas June 11, and Tampa July 2, with additional planned visits to Sacramento July 16 and Utah July 30.\n\nThe conference, organized in part by noted German lawyer and vaccine industry critic Reiner Fuellmich, posted this online statement:\n\nWe have made significant progress thus far \u2026 to lodge the first criminal case that will result in a grand jury being assembled to investigate the vast amount of evidence to indict various individuals responsible for crimes against humanity. All other cases lodged thus far are civil cases that have little chance of success\u2026 Only a criminal case will bring the result we all hope to see, which is the halting of the jab campaign and bringing those involved \u2026 to justice.\n\nFuellmich, Dr. Richard M. Fleming and Dr. Judy Mikovits have been among those making on-stage appearances along the tour, which constitutes \u201ca cross examination of the global pandemic, the global reset, and humanity\u2019s path to a Great Awakening,\u201d organizers say.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://americanfreepress.net/afpaudio/29_30_Audio/09_29_30_CDC_Anderson.mp3", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/1-year-digital-subscription/", "https://www.beatirs.com/", "https://johnellis.com/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/faucian-bargain/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/the-real-anthony-fauci/", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
