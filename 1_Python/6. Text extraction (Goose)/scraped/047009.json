The first one is a study on the \u201ctransmission-blocking vaccines\u201d for malaria-endemic countries, which received $135,000.\n\n\u201cThis project seeks to use a comprehensive antigen discovery pathway, including antigen identification through genome-wide immunological screening, validation in rodent malaria model, and further evaluation in P. vivax, to identify new transmission-blocking vaccine candidates for vivax malaria,\u201d the project summary stated. The grant was given to China Medical University.\n\nThe National Pulse noted that the said university is entirely controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and formerly known as the Peasants Red Army Military Medical School.\n\n\u201cIt is the only medical institution to have participated in the \u2018long march\u2019 in 1934 with the Red Army of the CCP,\u201d said Natalie Winters, National Pulse\u2018s lead investigative reporter and podcast host.\n\nThe other research focused on the spread of dengue fever in China, with $132,912 going to the Southern Medical University (SMU). Winters said the school was formerly known as First Military Medical University.\n\n\u201cSMU falls under the jurisdiction of the Military Committee of the PLA, according to its website. Professors, as well as entire institutes, have received awards from various branches of the PLA, including its general logistics department,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that this university\u2019s biomechanics laboratory operates under the control of the PLA and counts support of China\u2019s 863 programs, which has seen Chinese scientists affiliated with the effort get convicted for stealing trade secrets from American companies.\n\nThe school has also collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses. SMU provided human blood samples to the Wuhan lab for its controversial work with EcoHealth Alliance, another recipient of NIH grants.\n\nEven without this new revelation, Fauci is already considered the single biggest reason why COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic.\n\n\u201cHe has done incalculable damage throughout the world,\u201d Epoch Times columnist Jeffrey Tucker said during an interview with LifeSite News senior correspondent Jim Hale.\n\nTucker, the founder and president of Brownstone Institute, said the NIAID director\u2019s pandemic measures have damaged a lot of people and businesses.\n\n\u201cHe believed that he could control the spread through forced behavioral changes and worked very closely with Deborah Birx to bring this about,\u201d Tucker said.\n\nHe stressed that Fauci definitely lied about his funding of gain-of-function through Eco Health Alliance and friend Peter Daszak, who received several grants from NIAID. (Related: Fauci and the NIH caught funding China\u2019s covid bioweapons research.)\n\nAccording to Tucker, Fauci convinced Big Tech and mainstream media to back his campaign promoting fear and hysteria.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about that, he\u2019s lied about everything. He\u2019s lied about natural immunity. He was asked countless times about natural immunity [and] each time he said, \u2018Well, we are looking into that. We just don\u2019t know.\u2019 But we\u2019ve known about natural immunity for two and a half thousand years. And so this was just ridiculous,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch the below video that talks about the shameful legacy of Anthony Fauci.\n\nThis video is from the LSNTV channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nTWISTED: Fauci is now claiming that he never recommended lockdowns.\n\nWhy does it matter that Fauci got COVID-19.\n\nBirx admits she and Fauci made up \u201cthe science\u201d on social distancing, lockdowns.\n\nLawsuit filed against Fauci, Biden regime hacks for colluding with Big Tech to suppress free speech.", "opengraph": {"title": "Anthony Fauci, NIH fund China\u2019s military-run labs using US taxpayers\u2019 money", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-07-29-fauci-fund-china-military-run-labs-taxpayers-money.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "The National Pulse revealed in a recent article that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to China-based laboratories\u00a0with deep ties to the\u00a0People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).
