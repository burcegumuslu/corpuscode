They think they\u2019ll start that one in July. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s gonna give us a lot of answers. If they get through that, then we\u2019ll get the vaccine; keeping our fingers crossed.\u201d\n\nSo what does that mean in terms of when the public will be seeing a vaccine available?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that\u2019s even tougher to answer with certainty.\n\n\u201cThat usually takes months or years\u2014in this case, they\u2019re hoping months, so again I think that 12-18 month is probably somewhat expected,\u201d remarked Torres. \u201cSo we\u2019re talking sometime after the new year I think is when we\u2019ll get it. Maybe before if things fall into place really well.\u201d\n\nAnother point worthy of note regarding the early vaccine phase for Moderna was brought up by Daniel Salmon, Director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cI would certainly take this as good news, and it\u2019s certainly worth moving forward\u201d into later-stage trials, said Salmon. \u201cThere\u2019s just historically, if you look at vaccine development, lots of vaccines that look good out of Phase 1 that don\u2019t turn out to be good products.\u201d\n\nHear more on this story in the TODAY interview with Hota Kotb and Dr. John Torres below.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "When Will a Coronavirus Vaccine Be Ready?
