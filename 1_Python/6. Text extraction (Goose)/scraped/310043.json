More ominously, the \u201cmolecular genetic code\u201d for said \u201cnovel SARS CoV 2\u201d virus appears to be a computer generated model shared with the world via the World Health Organization (WHO), allowing for future \u201cpandemics\u201d to be manufactured via computer modeling rather than actual viral lab testing and isolation.\n\ntruth #3: COVIDtopia\u2019s biggest beneficiaries \u2013 Big Comm/Tech, the US Military, Big Pharma, and Big Global \u201cPublic Health\u201d Players like the UN/WHO and the BMGF / Wellcome Trust / GAVI / NIH \u2013 fund and fuel COVID 24/7 MSM news coverage (aka \u201cViral Fear Porn\u201d).\n\ntruth #4: US Big Tech Corporations censor and US MSM marginalize all vital COVID questions and debates.\n\ntruth #5: COVID \u201cconflict of interest\u201d computer modelling and death data counting are inaccurate, misleading, and dangerous.\n\ntruth #6: COVID \u201cPCR testing\u201d is scientifically nonsensical and dangerous to Human autonomy and sovereignty.\n\ntruth #7: COVIDtopia thrives on Human Fear, Virtue Signaling, Tribalization, and Dependency. Humans at their best exhibit Humility, Curiosity, Conscience, Courage, and Independence \u2013 as exhibited by both the Human entrepreneurial spirit (small businesses) and the Human desire to publicly gather for information sharing, story swapping and peaceable protest (1st Amendment and public debate, discussion and dialogue \u2013 hallmarks of any free and democratic society).\n\ntruth #8: Masks are ineffective at suppressing viruses (including COVID-19) and cause myriad harms to mask wearers. Here in Vermont, we recommend Amy Hornblas\u2019 excellent work producing the 2021 Vermont Mask Survey, one of thousands of courageous Vermonters challenging this COVIDtastrophe, as well as this exhaustive list of COVID-19 specific scientific studies re: masks and viruses from the Swiss Policy Research group.and their TOP TEN reasons why so many members of #TeamHuman complied with such non-scientific nonsense.\n\ntruth #9: COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d disguise experimental untested human cell reprogramming gene therapy technologies whose health consequences remain unknown, although emerging data published by the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) initiative indicates thousands of \u201cvaccine\u201d induced deaths and tens of thousands of \u201cvaccine\u201d induced \u201cadverse events.\u201d \u201cThe shots ARE the pandemic,\u201d as Nobel Prize winning French virologist Luc Montagnier observed in July 2021. Or, as the \u201cvaccine\u201d manufacturers themselves explain in their fine print, their injections suppress neither viral infections nor viral transmissions; their injections merely mask COVID-19 disease symptoms. In sum, \u201cvaccinated\u201d humans subject themselves to experimental injections out of Fear, Virtue, or Compliance, and then move through the world unwittingly transmitting disease because the injections merely mask their symptoms, while the \u201cvaccinated\u201d blame the so-called \u201cunvaccinated\u201d (Humans with healthy natural immunity) for viral spread due to \u201cselfishness\u201d or \u201cignorance.\u201d Orwellian. Moving into Autumn 2021, the data clearly indicate that these \u201cvaccines\u201d do not \u201cwork\u201d to stop infections or transmissions \u2013 just as their manufacturers stated months ago, even as they tout \u201cbooster\u201d shots as the next \u201csolution.\u201d (HINT: natural immunity is far superior to vaccine-induced immunity.)\n\ntruth #10: COVID will never \u201cgo away,\u201d if the global Transhumanist Technocrats funding and pushing the Great Reset and the 4th Industrial Revolution \u2013 (COVIDtopians) have their way. Time for #TeamHuman To Rise Up, Resist, and Be More Resilient. See our Conclusion below for dozens of ways to do so.\n\nA new Civilizational conundrum, shaped by the strange story of a Novel Virus.\n\nTruth be told, our current COVIDtastrophe has never been about a \u201cvirus,\u201d but about much bigger plans for Humanity.\n\nHow do we know?\n\nHere are but three eye-opening examples.\n\u2022 Oddly, \u201cglobal health partners\u201d \u2013 the UN\u2019s World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), John Hopkins University, the Rockefeller Foundation etc. \u2013 have planned (\u201cwar gamed,\u201d really) \u201cCOVID viral global pandemic\u201d scenarios for decades. #Plandemic\n\u2022 Curiously, the US Congress introduced the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act on January 24, 2019, fully ONE YEAR before SARS CoV 2\u2019s arrival on the world stage. (The so-called US CARES Act \u2013 Public Law No: 116-13 \u2013 passed March 27, 2020.\n\u2022 Strangely, the European Council, in collaboration with the organizations above, began planning for Orwellian \u201cvaccine passports\u201d years ago, developing a comprehensive \u201croll out\u201d strategy by 2019.\n\nFourth and most revealingly, this same group of organizational actors is busy planning their next \u201cpandemic.\u201d\n\nYou can read their SPARS #Plandemic blueprints, complete with a helpful Table of Contents, right here.\n\nThe list of COVID curiosities is lengthy, but let these four examples serve as illustrations as we begin our journey.\n\nTo repeat, this has never been about a \u201cvirus.\u201d\n\nThe goal, rather, is COVIDtopia.\n\nIn popular culture and historical imagination, \u201cUtopia\u201d has three meanings.\n\u2022 A place of ideal perfection, especially in laws, government, and social conditions.\n\nAll three meanings apply to this COVIDtopia we bewildered humans find ourselves inhabiting.\n\nCOVIDtopia, you ask? Whatever do you mean?\n\nI mean the strange \u201cdisconnect\u201d between Reality as commonly understood until 2020, and an imagined Viral Utopia that seems to have gripped the Human Psyche for a full year now.\n\nI define COVIDtopia as a collectively imagined Viral Utopia, a Brave New World into which we are being ushered, a watershed moment in Human history marked by the swift and radical reorganization of all Human affairs around the existential Fear of a Virus.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple statement that captures the essence of COVIDtopia.\n\n\u201cEven one COVID death is one too many!\u201d\n\nI have read, heard, and seen this statement uttered over and over and over again for one year now.\n\nThis statement, of course, is nonsensical, in a nation of 330 million citizens, where an average of three million Humans died in 2020 (between 8,000 and 10,000 daily US deaths) of myriad causes, and new Humans were born \u2013 close to four million babies joined US in 2020 (roughly 11,000 daily births \u2013 the lowest birth rate since 1985).\n\nLest you think I don\u2019t care about \u201cthe COVID killing Grandma,\u201d I offer three nearly universally agreed-upon observations about Life and Death: 1) Every Life is sacred, 2) Death comes for us all, and 3) Life and Death are the only two certainties that define the complex shared Reality of Human existence.\n\n\u201cBut 500,000 US humans died of COVID \u2013 an extremely contagious virus \u2013 in 2020!\u201d you may be thinking, quoting the incessant drumbeat of daily death data that defines the 24/7 COVIDtopian MSM news cycle.\n\nNo. 500,000 US humans died with COVID, officially, in 2020.\n\nOnly 6% of these humans died exclusively of COVID, according to Center for Disease Control (CDC) data.\n\nThat\u2019s 30,000 US humans whose lives were officially extinguished by COVID alone.\n\nRemembering that as many as 10,000 US Humans die every day, 30,000 US Humans dying exclusively of COVID suddenly seems rather trivial, at least in the ruthlessly objective language of statistics.\n\nIn fact, the CDC tells US that every year:\n\n600,000 US Humans die from various cancers.\n\nSo, every year, 1.6 million US Humans die from these six causes alone.\n\nIf COVID is indeed a US \u201cnational public health emergency,\u201d then COVID best get in line behind much more pressing public health emergencies, such as the six listed above.\n\nOne year into COVIDtopia, in a March 2021 open letter to my elected Vermont representatives, I made the following five observations:\n\n1) The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 99.96% of all Humans who have contracted COVID are recovering or have recovered with no long-term negative effects.\n\n2) In his book Underreported Truths About COVID-19, veteran New York Times journalist Alex Berenson notes that this 99.96% figure represents 999 of 1,000 Humans, statistically speaking.\n\n3) As of March 2021, we have lost approximately 200 Vermonters to the virus or \u201ccomplications from the virus\u201d this past year. Who were they? Our most vulnerable Vermont populations, mostly the advanced elderly and those with 3.8 co-morbidities (on average \u2013 see CDC\u2019s web site). Most all died with COVID, but not exclusively from COVID.\n\n4) To put this 200 COVID death rate number in perspective, Vermont loses, on average, 1,000 Vermonters annually, killed by tobacco-related illnesses.\n\nEvery year. 1,000. Give or take.\n\n5) COVIDtopia\u2019s untold consequences to Vermont\u2019s citizenry \u2013 in terms of un(der)employment, economic collapse, depression, anxiety, unpaid bills, housing displacement, alcoholism, drug abuse, suicide, family rifts, delayed medical procedures, etc. \u2013 are incalculable.\n\nThree of our four representatives acknowledged receipt of my letter. One representative responded in a short email urging me to contact the Governor\u2019s office, while another responded by insisting that \u201cVermont\u2019s COVID rules must be followed,\u201d failing to acknowledge the WHO and CDC\u2019s own data presented in my letter.\n\nTime for US to speak truths (plural) about COVID and the world it has wrought.\n\nIn ten truths, this book explores how COVIDtopia arrived, what COVIDtopia means for both US and our Planet, and why we must resist COVIDtopia at all costs.\n\nLet us be clear.\n\nCOVIDtopia, shaped by the current \u201cCOVID Crisis\u201d \u2013 is not about a \u201cVirus.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake, rather, is the future of our Human species and indeed, the future of our beautiful Planet.\n\nI write COVIDtopia from Vermont\u2019s Green Mountains, exactly one year into what the US mainstream news media (MSM) refer to as a \u201cglobal pandemic.\u201d\n\nOne year ago, I hiked to the top of a nearby 4,000+ foot peak called Camel\u2019s Hump, surveying the snow-covered beauty of the Vermont landscape around me in the company of my 21-year-old daughter Anneka and a friend. The trail up proved icy, the wind chilly, but the view from the pinnacle \u2013 the grateful feeling of being alive after a few hours of exertion, punctuated by moments of laughter, meditation, and conversation \u2013 made the trek worth our time and labor. Returning home, we built a crackling fire in the wood stove, enjoyed hot mugs of tea, fired up the outdoor sauna, and enjoyed a quiet dinner with family.\n\nThe next day, our world here in Vermont began to shut down. The \u201cCOVID-19 global viral pandemic\u201d had arrived in the Green Mountains.\n\nOn March 24, 2020, Vermont Republican governor Phil Scott issued an emergency order, suspending the Vermont Constitution by executive fiat and calling on all Vermonters to \u201cStay Home, Stay Safe.\u201d We need two weeks, Scott told Vermonters, to \u201cflatten the curve,\u201d slowing the spread of this \u201cnovel corona virus\u201d to allow Vermont hospitals and health clinics to best prepare.\n\n\u201cI want to be very clear about this: We need everyone to limit activities outside of the home and to practice social distancing at all times to slow the spread of this highly contagious and potentially deadly virus,\u201d said Governor Phil Scott one year ago. \u201cWe all must do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 to minimize infections \u2013 particularly for those who are elderly or have underlying chronic health conditions \u2013 and prevent it from overwhelming our healthcare facilities. The more Vermonters who take this seriously and stay home, the faster we can return to normal.\u201d By spring 2020, hastily erected viral \u201cfield hospitals\u201d sat unused, medical personnel furloughed, hospitals in Vermont as quiet as ghost towns.\n\nOne year later, Vermont Governor Phil Scott\u2019s emergency order is still in place. While 200 Vermonters have died from this \u201cnovel corona virus\u201d (most of them of advanced age in a few nursing homes with myriad co-morbidities) hundreds of thousands of Vermonters\u2019 lives have been upended: massive un(der)employment, uncertainty, anxiety, stress, rising levels of opioid, alcohol, drug and child abuse, masked students in all Vermont\u2019s public schools, colleges, and universities, and, most of all, Fear.\n\nHow did most Vermonters, indeed, most of US, come to accept COVIDtopia as acceptable?\n\nIndeed, how did nearly the entire Planet find itself in COVIDtopia\u2019s thrall?\n\nCOVIDtopia, a book I began researching the day Governor Scott imposed the lockdown, explores answers to these two questions.\n\nTo this book\u2019s subtitle \u2013 let\u2019s define our terms.\n\n\u201cTyranny\u201d is an old term referring to \u201ccruel, unreasonable, or arbitrary use of power or control,\u201d often applied to abusive or excessive government power.\n\nI coined this phrase after months of researching COVID data, and witnessing first-hand how government-imposed COVIDtopian viral policies \u2013 mandatory physical distancing, masking, economic lockdowns with no recompense, \u201cPCR testing,\u201d and now, perhaps, mandatory \u201cvaccinations\u201d- impacted citizens in Vermont, the US, and around the world.\n\nIf the use of the word \u201ctyranny\u201d seems like a stretch, just look into the eyes of the hundreds of thousands of Vermonters who have suffered under COVIDtopia.\n\nLook into their eyes, and, if they will even meet your gaze, tell me what you see.\n\nA phrase first coined during the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials, \u201chealth freedom\u201d is a fundamental human right embedded in international law after the victorious Allies exposed the horrific medical war crimes sanctioned by the Nazi regime, grotesque experiments committed by Nazi doctors and supported by the German nation \u2013 at that time, the world\u2019s most advanced country.\n\nCentral to health freedom is the legal concept of \u201cinformed consent,\u201d which states that any potentially performed medical procedure on any patient must first be subjected to two tests, posed here in the form of two questions:\n\u2022 Does the patient have a clear understanding of the medical procedure and potential consequences?\n\u2022 Has the patient fully agreed (\u201cconsented\u201d) to said medical procedure?\n\nHere is the 1947 Nuremberg Code \u201cinformed consent\u201d for \u201chealth freedom\u201d language, verbatim.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.\n\nThis means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.\u201d\n\nWhat many Humans don\u2019t realize is that WHO-recommended and US/Vermont government-imposed COVID policies like physical distancing, mask wearing, PCR testing, and \u201cvaccinations\u201d are all medical procedures of one form or another: top-down state-mandated interventions that deeply impact human psychology, physiology, and spiritual well-being, imposed on US for a full year now without any consideration of or public dialogue about \u201chealth freedom\u201d or \u201cinformed consent.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, \u201cfreedom\u201d isn\u2019t merely an abstract concept. When we Humans feel and know we are free, we experience all sorts of profound physiological changes. Our brain function increases and quickens, our endocrine levels optimize, our body\u2019s cells awaken to a higher degree, our energy output rises, and our Mind and Spirit awaken to the possibilities of our Potential.\n\nAnd without \u201cfreedom,\u201d of course, the opposite is true. Our brain functions decrease. Our endocrine levels destabilize. Our moods swing, beyond our control. Our body\u2019s cells go to sleep, our human energies go into hibernation, and our Mind and Spirit deaden.\n\nWithout health freedom, in short, we Humans cease to be fully Human.\n\nQuick history. We sapiens emerged from the trees tens of millions of years ago, and, in collaborative competition with other hominids like the Neanderthal and the Denisovan, we have evolved into the planet\u2019s most successful species. We humans, too, are the only species capable of flexible collaboration in large groups around shared stories, explains Israeli historian and futurist Yuval Noah Harari in his best-selling book Sapiens.\n\nTo wit: over the millennia, sapien inventions like hunting and gathering tools, spoken and written languages, fire, agriculture, harnessed energetic power (the 1st Industrial Revolution), electricity (the 2nd Industrial Revolution), computing, (the 3rd Industrial Revolution) and the digital Internet merging with networked artificial intelligence (the 4thIndustrial Revolution) have given us more mastery over our lives and our Planet.\n\nIronically, however, COVIDtopia, when treated as an unquestioned Official Narrative, leverages our most successful sapien impulses \u2013 the ability to collaborate flexibly in large groups around shared stories \u2013 against us, as we will see.\n\n\u201cDestiny\u201d refers to the ability of both individual Humans and our species as a whole to co-creatively imagine our own Future, and then bring to bear all of our energies \u2013 spiritual, mental, psychological, and physical \u2013 in manifesting our imagined future, co-creating our Fate in real time.\n\nHuman destiny is an evolutionary promise that COVIDtopia renders impossible.\n\nThe Italian dictator Benito Mussolini famously defined \u201cfascism\u201d as the merger of state and corporate power, at the expenses of individual rights and democratic processes. Fascism is found on the Right in extreme Nationalist movements (think Nazism), and found on the Left in ambitious \u201cone size fits all\u201d Globalist projects (think Communism or the United Nations), and is often disguised within any ideology or \u201cism\u201d that imposes one-size-fits-all initiatives onto the beautiful diversity of Human experience.\n\nWoke\u2019ism: an \u201cism\u201d that views Humans as little more than victims of a System of interlocking oppressions defined by a seemingly arbitrary handful of social categories (Race, Class, or Gender). In the \u201cWoke\u201d world, individuals are grouped into \u201ctribes\u201d by their visible physical characteristics (skin color or sexual organ differences), rather than considering each sovereign Human\u2019s unique skills, attributes, and potentialities.\n\nSafety\u2019ism: an \u201cism\u201d that prioritizes Safety (freedom from all risk) above all else within the Human experience. US elite liberal arts colleges\u2019 obsession with Safety\u2019ism \u2013 \u201csafe spaces,\u201d \u201cmicro aggressions,\u201d \u201canti-bias hotlines,\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d \u2013 capture this \u201cism\u201d quite well.\n\nThe term \u201cTechno,\u201d meanwhile, refers to an ominous civilizational trend \u2013 that of rendering to Technocrats (so-called \u201cexperts\u201d) more and more of our collective human experience. As a species, we are being herded like cattle into a planetary Age of Techno-Fascism. Lest this observation seem hyperbolic, consider that in the span of merely a year, COVIDtopia has emerged across the Planet as a techno-fascist force that goes by many names:\n\nThe Great Reset: with COVID as catalyst, the Globalist Digerati class declare we must suddenly and with great haste and little discussion reinvent Human civilization, fusing our Human neurophysiological and biological systems with digital technologies, creating a\u2026\n\n4th Industrial Revolution: the intruding of artificial intelligence via digital networks into even the most intimate Human affairs, biohacking our minds and bodies, to engender a\u2026\n\nTranshumanist Technocracy: a world of sapien cyborgs (part Human / part Machine) collectively \u201cmanaged\u201d via powerful digital networks by \u201cexperts\u201d for \u201cour own good,\u201d leading to a\u2026\n\nSingularity: the complete merger of Humans and Machines, which futurist Ray Kurzweil excitedly predicted would happen (back in his 2005 book) by mid 21st century.\n\nIf the above words and phrases are unfamiliar to you, I suggest a bit of research may be in order. In the meantime, COVIDtopia will touch on them throughout our journey.\n\nBooks are never written alone, but rather, through the collective efforts of bright and aware Humans doing good work in the world.\n\nSo, gratitude to the following.\n\nThanks to our Vermont Independent community of readers and contributors for their critical support; yak friends around the world for daily living and learning in the close company of a remarkably adaptable mammalian species (bos grunniens); the Our Geoengineering Age research team for demonstrating how interdisciplinary environmental research can work; and my university students for their friendship and hard work, and for enduring this COVID\u2019addled civilizational moment with grit and grace.\n\nSpecial thanks to four Vermonters without whose friendship and support I would be lost.\n\nIan Baldwin, for his unflagging comradery, abiding mentorship, and deep wisdom.\n\nPete Garritano, for his good grace, humble humor, and scientific dedication to weekly consulting the COVID Oracles, including ever-changing World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease Control (CDC) web sites.\n\nAndrew McClymont, for his wicked wit, entrepreneurial spirit, and unflagging optimism during our weekly F2F coffee chats and cold plunges in the Mad River.\n\nAimee Stephenson, for her courage in speaking out, her \u201ccan do\u201d irreverence, and her willingness to share her deep understanding of science and medicine as a University of Vermont (UVM) trained PhD in microbiology.\n\nIn the midst of any civilizational crisis, you can find three groups of Humans.\n\nThose who create the Illusion, those who believe the Delusion, and those who clarify the Confusion.\n\nI write this book with all three groups in mind.\n\nMy hope, of course, is that COVIDtopia will inspire you, dear reader, to destroy the Illusion, reject the Delusion, and clarify the Confusion.\n\nIndeed, our Human destiny and the future of our beautiful Planet depends on it.\n\nWe Humans, each of us, is a highly evolved self-organizing system.\n\nIn our gloriously flawed evolutionary uniqueness, we are each comprised of (give or take) 30 trillion cells, 40 trillion bacteria, and 380 trillion viruses in or on a Human body, claims Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative, dubbed the Human Microbiome Project (begun in 2007).\n\nGiven our astonishingly complex Human microbiome, how do we highly evolved Humans, (both individually and as a species) become Healthy, Strong, and Happy?\n\u2022 Practicing daily breathing protocols \u2013 we Humans have invented myriad options for deepening our spiritual life through mindfulness, prayer, and meditation.\n\n3. Pursuing regular exercise, Outside, in Nature: walking, hiking, running, swimming, climbing \u2013 all of which contribute to our ongoing evolutionary success as a species.\n\n4. Resting every evening, allowing our Minds, Bodies and Spirits to recuperate from the creative complexities of Daily Living.\n\n5. Developing relationships with other living Beings \u2013 plants, animals, and the Planet as a Whole.\n\n6.
