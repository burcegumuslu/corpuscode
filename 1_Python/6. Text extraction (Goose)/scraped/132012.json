He shared this belief with Dr. Daniel Bobinski during the March 9 episode of \u201cKeep The Republic\u201d on Brighteon.TV.\n\n\u201cThis AI topic is going to change the world. It is the Fourth Industrial Revolution,\u201d Mitson said, adding that expertise in the application of AI to business is an emerging field.\n\n\u201cThe big focus is how to help the businesses that I\u2019ve worked with to really accelerate their profitability, maintain, reduce or grow their capability and reduce their headcount. AI seemed like the perfect tool to do it \u2013 and then ChatGPT happened. This was perfect timing for those efforts.\u201d\n\nBobinski, meanwhile, remarked that the user-friendly ChatGPT can be used by most companies that have a sales force.\n\nHis guest agreed, saying that AI can be used to go through a list of leads and identify common characteristics by placing a buyer profile on customers. It can also reprocess leads and return the top 150 that qualify under different criteria.\n\nMitson, the author of the book \u201cCorporate Strategy in the Age of AI,\u201d also noted that AI can identify contact information of customers and help sales representatives reach out to them. He continued that aside from sending the right message to the right people, AI also enables making different sales pitches to the customer.\n\nThe \u201cKeep The Republic\u201d host seconded his guest\u2019s remarks, pointing out that using AI can save lots of time searching for possible clients, which could take weeks or months for humans. (Related: Welcome to your jobless future\u2026 Artificial intelligence will replace half of all jobs in the next decade.)\n\nBut AI is still a work in progress.\n\nBobinski recounted an experiment he conducted using ChatGPT, telling the AI bot to summarize the stance of Idaho Gov. Brad Little on the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) based on an article the program host wrote. He was insulted by the reply given to him, implying that his data was neither factual nor reliable.\n\nNoting the program\u2019s left-wing stance, Bobinski stated that people need to learn how to ask ChatGPT the right questions. He also noted the importance of pushing back when the AI adopts a holier-than-thou approach.\n\nIn response to the \u201cKeep The Republic\u201d host\u2019s question about other AI platforms that lean left, Mitson said there are already five others that exhibit various levels of wokeism. However, ChatGPT is the farthest when it comes to capability. Mitson ultimately remarked that there is no AI chatbot that is truly conservative and credible.\n\nIn spite of this, Mitson said the discouraging things about the ChatGPT and other liberal AIs will eventually drive the development of conservative versions.\n\nEven SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk observed this leftist bias in ChatGPT, accusing its creator OpenAI of training the platform\u2019s language models to be \u201cwoke.\u201d According to the Toronto Star, the technology bigwig is now working on a conservative version of ChatGPT \u2013 and is now recruiting AI researchers for the endeavor.\n\nFollow Robots.news for more news about AI.\n\nWatch the March 9 episode of \u201cKeep the Republic\u201d below. \u201cKeep the Republic\u201d with Dr. Daniel Bobinski airs every Thursday at 4 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nRise of the robots: 8 professions that will be taken over by AI technology,\n\nArtificial intelligence ChatGPT program successfully passes Bar, medical licensing exams \u2013 are machines taking over the world?\n\nRise of the machines: Expert warns AI will take over 20% of all jobs within 5 YEARS.", "opengraph": {"title": "Keep The Republic: Fourth Industrial Revolution will change the world via AI \u2013 Brighteon.TV", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-03-17-fourth-industrial-revolution-change-world-via-ai.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "Strategic leader and technologist Justin Mitson believes the Fourth Industrial Revolution will change the world through artificial intelligence (AI).
