So far, the mandatory vaccination applies only to children and the new project will be made extensive also to adults. The gratuity of the vaccines, in as much, happened in fact, but from now on it will be protected by law.\n\nAccording to the text itself, it will be the Executive, through the Ministry of Health of the Nation, which must regulate in a term of 120 days the fine print of the norm for its specific application.\n\nThe legislator also explained one of the points of the project that generated more controversy. Until now, proof of vaccination was a requirement to enroll in schools. But Article 9 of the new law states that \u201cthe certification of compliance with the National Vaccination Calendar must be required\u201d also at the time of processing the ID, passport or driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cIt will not interrupt the processing of any document,\u201d said Yedlin and explained that in case of not presenting the full schedule of vaccinations, the person will be \u201cnotified\u201d as well as the local health authority, to get in contact and \u201coffer the necessary vaccines\u201d. \u201cThey are control points,\u201d the Tucuman insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you will not be able to sign up for the faculty if you do not have the Hepatitis B vaccine, but the university has the right to send you to vaccinate because it\u2019s mandatory that you have it.\u201d\n\nComment on this article at VaccineImpact.com.\n\nLeaving a lucrative career as a nephrologist (kidney doctor), Dr. Suzanne Humphries is now free to actually help cure people.\n\nIn this autobiography she explains why good doctors are constrained within the current corrupt medical system from practicing real, ethical medicine.\n\nOne of the sane voices when it comes to examining the science behind modern-day vaccines, no pro-vaccine extremist doctors have ever dared to debate her in public.\n\nSay NO to Mandatory Vaccines T-Shirt\n\nBig Pharma and government health authorities are trying to pass laws mandating vaccines for all children, and even adults.\n\nShow your opposition to forced vaccinations and support the cause of Vaccine Impact, part of the Health Impact News network.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Health Impact News", "type": "article", "title": "Argentina Creates Mandatory Vaccination Law For Passport, ID, Driver\u2019s License, School & More", "description": "According to a new Argentine law, in order to renew one's DNI, passport and registration, a complete vaccination card must be presented.
