About 40,300 AEEs were reported in VAERS following COVID-19 vaccinations. This may be an under-estimation of actual AEE-related damage since biomarkers that could reflect pre-clinical AEEs and general symptoms that applied to myriad diseases were not assessed. The main emphases of the AEEs were menstruation abnormalities (e.g., Menstruation Irregular (3911 entries), Dysmenorrhoea (2166), Menstruation Delayed (1262), Amenorrhoea (863), Polymenorrhoea (777), Oligomenorrhoea (686), Hypomenorrhoea (202), Menopause (168)) and metabolic imbalances.\n\nIn the text, an example of possible real-world scale-up AEE numbers from VAERS entry numbers was provided; based on the assumptions used, a result of ~1,343,600 AEEs was obtained. It should be emphasized that scale-up from VAERS entry numbers to real-world numbers is unknown with any degree of accuracy at this point, but has the potential to result in large numbers of COVID-19 vaccine-induced AEEs (and subsequent reduced lifespans) over time.\n\nThose AEE types that had the highest VAERS entry numbers were one-to-two orders-of-magnitude higher than their flu vaccine counterparts.\n\nTracking of AEEs cases over the next few years would help indicate any significant increases caused by the administration of the COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, the paucity or absence of human clinical trials before approval of the COVID-19 vaccines is completely incompatible with the potential for emergence of AEEs following COVID-19 vaccination, as indicated by the results in the present OpEd. Adequate pre-distribution testing for the COVID-19 vaccines may have been precluded by the legalistic framework established for Public Health Emergencies over the past five decades, as discussed in Appendix 1.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A Letter to the Editor: \"About 40,300 AEEs were reported in VAERS following COVID-19 vaccinations\"", "description": "It\u00a0examines\u00a0the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) comprehensively for reports of adverse endocrine events (AEEs).\u00a0", "url": "https://dailyclout.io/a-letter-to-the-editor-about-40300-aees-were-reported-in-vaers-following-covid-19-vaccinations/", "site_name": "DailyClout", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyclout/", "article:published_time": "2023-03-21T18:38:35+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-21T18:44:30+00:00", "image": "https://dailyclout.io/wp-content/uploads/Capture-558.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "487", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/are-covid-19-vaccine-induced-adverse-endocrine-events-rare-b4f0ecca", "https://gettr.com/share?text=A%20Letter%20to%20the%20Editor%3A%20%22About%2040%2C300%20AEEs%20were%20reported%20in%20VAERS%20following%20COVID-19%20vaccinations%22&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyclout.io%2Fa-letter-to-the-editor-about-40300-aees-were-reported-in-vaers-following-covid-19-vaccinations%2F", "https://dailyclout.io/a-letter-to-the-editor-about-40300-aees-were-reported-in-vaers-following-covid-19-vaccinations/"], "authors": ["DailyClout"], "publish_date": "2023-03-21T18:38:35+00:00"}
