Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nCOVID Vaccine to Be Offered to Vulnerable Babies and Children in U.K.\n\nChildren aged between six months and four years old who are deemed clinically vulnerable will be offered two doses of a COVID vaccine, public health bodies in the U.K. have announced.\n\nThe move, revealed by the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) after approval by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI), comes after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved for children of this age by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in December. Children who are not clinically vulnerable are not included in the U.K.-wide offer.\n\nAccording to NHS England, the vaccines will begin to be offered to those eligible in England from mid-June. The body has advised that parents should wait to be contacted before coming forward.\n\nUKHSA added that more than 1 million children aged six months to four years in the U.S. had received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine since June.\n\nA Utah woman has filed a product liability lawsuit over cervical cancer diagnosed after a Gardasil vaccine, indicating the manufacturer over-promoted the safety and effectiveness of the widely used HPV vaccine. The complaint was filed by Caroline Grace Cantera in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina on March 16, presenting claims against Merck & Co. as the defendant.\n\nCantera indicates that she was 19 years old when she received the first of three Gardasil injections in December 2016. After her second injection, in March 2018, a Pap test showed she had no signs of cervical cancer. However, after the third injection in April 2018, Cantera began suffering fatigue, severe stomach pains, anxiety and weakness throughout her body.\n\nAfter first thinking it was stress, she sought medical help after her period lasted for more than four weeks and was diagnosed with stage four cervical cancer. As a result of the Gardasil cervical cancer diagnosis, Cantera underwent multiple biopsies, CT scans, MRIs, chemotherapy, three brachytherapy treatments and 30 radiation treatments.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Merck intentionally falsely advertised and overstated the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine, which failed to prevent, and potentially caused, Cantera to develop advanced-stage cervical cancer.\n\nModerna\u2019s CEO Bancel Suggests That Lower Demand for the COVID Vaccine Is a Justification for Quadrupling of the Price\n\nLast month, during a Senate hearing in which Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel testified regarding the quadrupling in the list price of the company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, he cited lower consumer demand as one of several reasons for the need to raise the price. To an economist like myself, but also to the general public that\u2019s an extraordinarily odd justification. Higher prices don\u2019t reflect lower demand. Rather, they\u2019re a function of a sub-optimal market.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, the federal government has provided Americans with COVID-19 tests, vaccines and treatments free of charge, but this will soon change. On May 11, the U.S. public health emergency for COVID-19 will end. The Biden Administration says it\u2019s \u201ctransitioning\u201d COVID-19-related costs to public and private markets, including health insurers and pharmacies.\n\nLate last year, the White House COVID-19 Response Team Coordinator Ashish Jha said his \u201chope is that in 2023, you\u2019re going to see the commercialization of almost all of these products.\u201d Of course, this does beg the question, aren\u2019t all these products being commercialized now?\n\nCommercialization is simply the process of doing something principally for financial gain. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech are definitely in this to make a profit, even when the federal government is the main purchaser.\n\nJohnson & Johnson shares on Wednesday climbed after the company proposed paying $8.9 billion to settle thousands of claims that its baby powder and other talc products caused cancer.\n\nMore than 60,000 claimants have committed to support the proposed resolution, which would require approval in bankruptcy court, the company announced in a securities filing late Tuesday.\n\nJ&J\u2019s stock closed nearly 4.5% higher Wednesday. The company\u2019s market value stands at more than $430 billion.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant also said its subsidiary LTL Management refiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after its first attempt faced legal challenges. The subsidiary is shouldering tens of thousands of talc lawsuits in a bid to reduce J&J\u2019s losses from litigation and settlement.\n\nPfizer Moves on up to the West Side, Establishing New Nerve Center at Hudson Yards\u2019 Spiral Skyscraper\n\nFrom medication to meditation, Pfizer\u2019s new West Side Manhattan headquarters is a ritzy real-estate ode to its workers.\n\nFor more than sixty years, Pfizer has operated out of a revamped revolutionary-era building near Manhattan\u2019s Grand Central Terminal and the U.N. And now, Pfizer is pulling back the curtain on its new home base at The Spiral in New York City\u2019s Hudson Yards. Pfizer first telegraphed the move almost five years ago to the day and began welcoming roughly 2,500 staffers to the swanky new digs last December.\n\nPfizer\u2019s move into the new headquarters \u201cmarks the beginning of an exciting and important chapter for Pfizer,\u201d CEO Albert Bourla said in the press release. It comes as the long-time New York resident has expanded its business exponentially thanks to COVID-19 products.\n\nPfizer has been using the COVID windfall to grow in other areas through mergers and acquisitions. These include the $5.4 billion purchase of rare blood disorder drug developer Global Blood Therapeutics and the $11.6 billion buyout of Biohaven for its migraine portfolio. And Pfizer is beefing up in oncology, shelling out $43 billion to take over antibody-drug conjugate specialist Seagen.\n\nThe \u2018King Kong\u2019 of Weight-Loss Drugs Is Coming\n\nPeople who are overweight are flocking to the drug Ozempic to slim down. Looming is an even more powerful weight-loss treatment. The drug Mounjaro helped a typical person with obesity who weighed 230 pounds lose up to 50 pounds during a test period of nearly 17 months.\n\nNo anti-obesity drug has ever safely made such a difference. In the coming months, it is widely expected to get the go-ahead from U.S. health regulators to be prescribed for losing weight and keeping it off, and some patients are already using it unapproved for that purpose.\n\nThe advance of Mounjaro, which is already on the market to treat Type 2 diabetes, has excited doctors and patients who have been waiting decades for effective treatments, while helping turn its maker, Eli Lilly & Co., into the most valuable standalone pharmaceutical company in the U.S. with a market value of more than $300 billion.\n\nMounjaro could be one of the highest-selling drugs of all time with annual sales exceeding $25 billion. Novo\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy brought in close to $10 billion last year, with prescriptions rapidly growing.\n\nOver a four-day period last summer, Dustin Pack set out into Tampa Bay in search of one of the most coveted fish species in Florida.\n\nHe was fishing for science. Pack was recruited to hook redfish for a new statewide study, released this week, which examined the species\u2019 blood for 94 commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. With Pack\u2019s help, a researcher at Florida International University caught 15 redfish around Tampa Bay, in areas ranging from the northern Hillsborough Bay to the bay\u2019s southern mouth at Emerson Point.\n\nNow the results are public: All 15 fish in Tampa Bay had drugs in their blood. Specifically, every redfish had a heart medicine called Tambocor in its system, according to the study published in partnership with the Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, a Miami-based conservation organization. The pharmaceutical is prescribed to treat irregular heartbeats.\n\nAcross the nine Florida estuaries examined for the study, Tampa Bay and Apalachicola had the highest number of pharmaceutical detections, according to the research. Redfish throughout Florida have an average of two different drugs in their blood. In Tampa Bay, that number is three.\n\nGSK Will Have to Pay Additional Royalties to AstraZeneca on Cancer Drug Zejula\n\nWhen Emma Walmsley took over as CEO at GSK in 2017, one of her first moves was to beef up the company\u2019s oncology portfolio with a $5.1 billion acquisition of cancer specialist Tesaro and its newly approved drug Zejula.\n\nThe ovarian cancer treatment generated 463 million pounds sterling ($571 million) in 2022, representing a 17% increase from the previous year. So far, so good, right?\n\nWell, not exactly. After losing a patent case in court Wednesday, GSK will have to surrender a portion of its sales of Zejula to Tesaro\u2019s partner on the drug, AstraZeneca.\n\nAn AstraZeneca spokesperson said the company was \u201cpleased\u201d with the decision. GSK plans to look at \u201cnext steps,\u201d a spokesperson told Reuters.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID Vaccine to Be Offered to Vulnerable Babies and Children in U.K. + More", "description": "The Defender\u2019s Big Pharma Watch delivers the latest headlines related to pharmaceutical companies and their products, including vaccines, drugs, and medical devices and treatments.
