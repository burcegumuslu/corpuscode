Posted in Latest news\n\nCity food supplies cannot survive without reliable refrigeration at every level, from farms to retail stores. But green propagandists continue to inflict lethal damage to our electricity industry \u2013 it has become dangerously unreliable and dreadfully expensive.\n\nThis will produce unreliable and expensive food supplies. Their intrusive green-energy infrastructure is also nibbling away at our grasslands and farms, thus reducing their capacity to produce food. [emphasis, links added]\n\nLess recognized is the damage green propagandists are doing to public health and our food supply by attacking animal foods, and promoting grains, vegetables, seeds, and fake foods for humans.\n\nAs far back as we have recorded history, humans have been hunter-gatherers.\n\nThey hunted, cooked, ate and sometimes farmed cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, ducks, turkeys, swans, antelope, buffalo, caribou, mammoths, deer, bears, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, seals, herrings, prawns, oysters, crabs, clams, cod, whales, sharks, salmon, kangaroos, possums, rabbits, hares, rats, mice, dogs, cougars, eels, snakes and even other humans (aboriginal cannibals on the Palmer River goldfield in early Australia preferred to eat sweet Chinamen who ate lots of rice rather than overly salty Britishers who ate lots of salt beef.)\n\nWhen the hunters were successful, the tribe rejoiced and feasted mightily before the meats spoiled. But when the hunters failed, they relied on the gatherers for ripening fruits, honey, tubers, wild onions, nuts and laboriously harvested grains.\n\nThey learned that some plant foods were toxic unless treated in special ways by grinding, roasting, fermenting, and cooking.\n\nMeats were the favored food but some tribes also consumed raw milk, butter, cheese, and blood from their animals. Some ate fish and waterfowl.\n\nFruits were seasonal foods and tubers, onions, and grains were survival foods. Party foods like sugar and alcohol were more recent inventions.\n\nHuman teeth reflect the foods they are designed to use \u2013 canines for gripping and ripping meat off bones, incisors for cutting bite-sized bits, and molars for chewing and grinding.\n\nAnd humans have the forward-focused eyes of predators, not the all-around eyesight of their wary herbivorous prey.\n\nMen have always battled over hunting, fishing, and farming territory, but now greens are trying to lock all humans out with national parks, world heritage declarations, and bans and quotas on farming, fishing, and hunting.\n\nThey subsidize the sterilization of farms and grasslands with wind and solar \u201cfarms\u201d, access roads, and a spiderweb of power lines.\n\nThey also promote the conversion of farmland to bushland and encourage offshore bird choppers whose sonic noise upsets neighbors and seems to addle the navigating abilities of some sea creatures.\n\nNow greens are attacking our carnivore diet and promoting a granivore-vegetarian diet for humans.\n\nPoliticians should be free to choose their own diet but they should not force meat lovers to pretend they are granivores with crops and gizzards, or plant-eating ruminants with extra stomachs and who spend ages re-chewing their vegetarian cuds.\n\nUnfortunately, the world\u2019s teeming cities are becoming increasingly reliant on grains, sugars, oil seeds, fruits, and vegetables grown by intense farming and heavily dependent on irrigation, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers.\n\nGrain-dependent feedlots produce much of our beef, pork, mutton, salmon, prawns, chickens, and eggs; factories produce our baked, frozen and canned foods. Now greens are promoting denatured fake \u201cmeat\u201d and \u201cmilk\u201d, which contain neither meat nor milk.\n\nWhilst intense farming has fostered a dramatic increase in the human population, the human food chain is swamped with grains, greens, and seed oils with their unhealthy lectins, glutens, oxalates, phytic acid, harmful oils, artificial sweeteners, chemical additives, and sprays.\n\nThis process parallels a dramatic deterioration in human health. Like green energy, green food for humans is proving a disastrous choice.\n\nPretending humans are herbivores and granivores has accompanied an epidemic of ill health.\n\nObesity, arthritis, heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, leaky gut, fatty liver, dental caries, heart failure, cancers, brain fog, knee replacement, stomach stitching, birth defects, and gender confusion seem to be hallmarks of our age. The surgery waiting lists keep expanding.\n\nBut instead of trying to fix our dietary problems, we have created a massive new \u201chealth\u201d industry.\n\nWhile human diets race off in the wrong direction, health research seeks magic bullets and focuses on profitable vaccines, patentable medicines, expensive surgery, and genetic wizardry.\n\nEven grazing animals that once lived mainly on grasses and herbs (with little ripening grass seeds just before the hard times of winter) are now confined in food factories, with little exercise, and encouraged to gorge on farmed grains.\n\nOmnivorous pigs and chickens and vegetarian cattle and sheep now stand in pens and feedlots eating grain-rich feeds.\n\nThe bun, chips, salad, and sauces have swamped the meat in the \u201cbeef\u201d burger and there is more batter and potato than seafood in \u201cfish and chips.\u201d\n\nBreakfast cereals have replaced bacon and eggs, and fake \u201cmeat\u201d and fake \u201cmilk\u201d are lauded as healthy choices.\n\nWe can see the obese results of this green food revolution waddling down the aisles of supermarkets and ordering green smoothies and muffins in the food courts.\n\nGreen energy will prove a disaster for our economy, and green foods will be a deadly choice for many humans.\n\nFuture footpaths will be crowded with mobility scooters and hospitals and care homes will be overwhelmed by unhealthy aging vegans.\n\nViv Forbes has studied science and grazing animal management. He started his adult life believing in all government health advice. He ate minimal butter, cheese, and salt and chose lots of vegetarian options, including fake meat. Health for him and his family suffered. Slowly he came to his senses, returned to a \u201cHunter Gatherer\u201d diet, and experienced real improvements in Health (almost too late).\n\nIn his final class at Warwick High School, one student and one parent may have been classed as \u201coverweight\u201d. The ABS now reports that 67% of all Australian adults and 25% of children are overweight or obese.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Greens Are Creating A Man-Made Food And Health Disaster", "description": "Green energy and green foods are proving disastrous for our economy, and a deadly choice for many humans.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2023-04-03T13:02:14+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/australia-solar-wind.jpg", "image:width": "1888", "image:height": "1305", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-dark-ages-for-australian-energy-are-here/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/no-renewables-are-not-the-cheapest-form-of-new-energy/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/greens-australia-bushfires-worse/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/midwest-farmland-targeted-by-1300-mile-carbon-capture-pipeline/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/solars-lofty-ambitions-are-eating-ever-larger-expanses-of-land/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wind-solar-biofuel-energy-devastating-planet-earth/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/spurning-rural-pleas-oregon-supreme-court-approves-300-mile-wind-power-line/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-sinister-truth-about-bird-killing-wind-farms/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/meet-the-dutch-climate-refugees-fleeing-unbearably-noisy-wind-farms/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/evidence-shows-offshore-wind-activity-is-killing-lots-of-whales/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/germany-forcing-farmers-to-use-less-fertilizer-to-satisfy-eus-green-agenda/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wapo-props-up-fake-meat-company-that-vows-to-save-the-planet/", "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cartoon-fake-meat.jpg?ssl=1", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/media-claims-global-crops-shrinking-as-harvests-set-records/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/real-meat-vs-plant-based-meat-whats-really-greener/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-real-threats-to-biodiversity-and-humanity/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/starbucks-ban-dairy-for-climate/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/destroying-australias-economy-with-fake-renewables-and-big-batteries/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20How%20Greens%20Are%20Creating%20A%20Man-Made%20Food%20And%20Health%20Disaster&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fhow-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/#print", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-greens-are-creating-a-man-made-food-and-health-disaster/trackback/"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2023-04-03T13:02:14+00:00"}
