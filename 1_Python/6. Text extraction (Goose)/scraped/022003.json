Four days earlier, the historic document had been adopted by delegates to the Continental Congress, but the bell did not ring to announce the issuing of the document until the Declaration of Independence returned from the printer on July 8.\n\nIn 1751, to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of Pennsylvania\u2019s original constitution, the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly ordered the bell to be constructed. After being cracked during a test, and then recast twice, the bell was hung from the State House steeple in June 1753. Rung to call the Pennsylvania Assembly together and to summon people for special announcements and events, it was also rung on important occasions, such as King George III\u2019s 1761 ascension to the British throne and, in 1765, to call the people together to discuss Parliament\u2019s controversial Stamp Act. With the outbreak of the American Revolution in April 1775, the bell was rung to announce the battles of Lexington and Concord. Its most famous tolling, however, was on July 8, 1776, when it summoned Philadelphia citizens for the first reading of the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\ud83e\udd21 Joe Biden has only done 2 press interviews in 2022\n\n\ud83c\udd98 60% of small businesses say inflation is hurting them worse than Covid lockdowns\n\n\u260e\ufe0fRogers telecommunications company offline.
