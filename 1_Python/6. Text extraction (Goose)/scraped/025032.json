All PCR tests monitored by the CDC are set at 37 to 45 cycles. The CDC acknowledges that tests over 28 cycles are not allowed for a positive reliable result.\n\nThis invalidates over 90% of the alleged Covid cases / \u201cinfections\u201d detected by the use of this incorrect test.\n\nIn addition to the incorrect tests and fraudulent death certificates, the \u201cexperimental\u201d vaccine itself violates Article 32 of the Geneva Convention.\n\nUnder Article 32 of the 1949 Geneva Convention, \u201cmutilation and medical or scientific experiments not required for the medical treatment of a protected person\u201d are prohibited.\n\nAccording to Article 147, conducting biological experiments on protected persons is a serious breach of the Convention.\n\nAlso: Educate Yourself: How Herbs Used in the 1918 Flu Pandemic Can Be Effective Today. Video below:\n\nThe \u201cexperimental\u201d vaccine violates all 10 Nuremberg codes \u2013 which carry the death penalty for those who try to break these international laws.\n\n1) Provides immunity to the virus\n\nThis is a \u201cleaky\u201d gene therapy that does not provide immunity to Covid and claims that they reduce the symptoms, but double-vaccinated are now 60% of patients who need ER or ICU with covid infections.\n\n2) Protects the recipients from getting the virus\n\nThis gene therapy does not provide immunity and the double vaccine can still catch and spread the virus.\n\nThis gene therapy does not reduce deaths from the infection. Double-vaccinated people infected with Covid have also died.\n\n4) Reduces the circulation of the virus\n\nThis gene therapy still allows the virus to spread because it gives zero immunity to the virus.\n\n5) Reduces the transmission of the virus\n\nThis gene therapy still allows transmission of the virus because it does not confer immunity to the virus.\n\nThe following violations of the Nuremberg Code apply:\n\nNo person should be forced to take a medical experiment without informed consent.\n\nMany media, political and non-medical people urge people to take the injection.\n\nThey do not provide information about the negative effects or dangers of this gene therapy. All you hear from them is \u2013 \u201csafe and effective\u201d and \u201cthe benefits outweigh the risks.\u201d\n\nCountries use blockades, coercion and threats to force people to take this vaccine or are banned from participating in free society under the mandate of a vaccine pass or Green Pass.\n\nDuring the Nuremberg trials, the media were also prosecuted and members were killed for lying to the public, along with many of the doctors and Nazis found guilty of crimes against humanity.\n\nReference: This Secret Ancient Japanese Tonic Recipe Will Help You Melts 54 LBS Of Fat\n\nNuremberg Code # 2: Yields with fruitful results that cannot be produced by other means\n\nAs mentioned above, gene therapy does not meet the criteria for a vaccine and does not offer immunity to the virus. There are other medical treatments that give fruitful results against Covid, such as Ivermectin, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and strengthened immune system for flu and colds.\n\nNuremberg Code # 3: Basic experiments as a result of animal experiments and natural history disease\n\nThis gene therapy skipped animal experiments and went directly to human experiments.\n\nIn mRNA research used by Pfizer \u2013 a candidate study on mRNA with rhesus macaques monkeys using BNT162b2 mRNA and in that study all monkeys developed pneumonia but the researchers considered the risk low because these were young healthy monkeys from 2-4 years of age.\n\nIsrael has used Pfizer and the International Court of Justice has accepted a requirement that 80% of recipients with pneumonia should be injected with this gene therapy.\n\nDespite this alarming development, Pfizer continued to develop its mRNA for Covid, without animal testing.\n\nSince the launch of the experiment and listed under the CDC VAERS reporting system, over 4,000 deaths and 50,000 vaccine injuries have been reported in the United States. In the EU, more than 7,000 deaths and 365,000 vaccine injuries have been reported. This is a serious violation of this code.\n\nNuremberg Code # 5: No experiment should be performed if there is reason to believe that injury or death will occur\n\nSee No. 4, based on fact-based medical data, this gene therapy causes death and injury. Previous research on mRNA also shows several risks that have been ignored for this current experimental gene experiment. A 2002 study of SARS-CoV-1 nail proteins showed that they cause inflammation, immunopathology, blood clots and inhibit Angiotensin 2 expression. This experiment forces the body to produce this nail protein that inherits all these risks.\n\nNuremberg Code # 6: The risk should never exceed the benefit\n\nCovid-19 has a recovery rate of 98-99%. Vaccine damage, death, and adverse side effects of mRNA gene therapy far outweigh this risk.\n\nThe use of \u201cleaky\u201d vaccines was banned for agricultural use by the US and the EU due to the Marek Chicken study which shows \u201chot viruses\u201d and variants appear\u2026 make the disease even more deadly.\n\nNevertheless, this has been ignored for human use by the CDC aware that the risk of new, more deadly variants arises from leaky vaccinations. The CDC is fully aware that the use of leaky vaccines facilitates the emergence of hotter (more deadly) strains. Yet they have ignored this when it comes to humans\n\nNuremberg Code # 7: Preparations must be made for even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death\n\nNo preparations were made. This gene therapy skipped animal experiments. The pharmaceutical companies\u2019 own clinical phase 3 studies will not end until 2022/2023. These vaccines were approved in an emergency\n\nUse only action to force on a misinformed public. They are NOT FDA approved.\n\nNuremberg Code # 8: Experiments must be carried out by scientifically qualified persons\n\nPoliticians, the media and actors who claim that this is a safe and effective vaccine are not qualified. Propaganda is not medical science.\n\nMany stores such as Walmart & drive-through vaccine centers are not qualified to administer experimental medical gene therapies to the uninformed public.\n\nNuremberg Code # 9: Everyone must have the freedom to end the experiment at any time\n\nDespite the call from over 85,000 doctors, nurses, virologists and epidemiologists \u2013 the experiment does not end. In fact, there are currently many attempts to change laws to enforce vaccine compliance.\n\nThis includes mandatory and mandatory vaccinations. Experimental \u201csprayers\u201d are planned every six months without using the growing number of deaths and injuries already caused by this experiment.\n\nThese update images will be administered without any clinical trials. Hopefully, this new Nuremberg trial will put an end to this crime against humanity.\n\nNuremberg Code # 10: The researcher must terminate the experiment at any time if there is a probable cause for injury or death\n\nIt is clear from statistical reporting data that this experiment leads to death and injury. But not all politicians, pharmaceutical companies and so-called experts make any attempt to stop this gene therapy experiment from harming a misinformed public.\n\nLegal proceedings are progressing, evidence has been gathered and a large growing group of experts is sounding the alarm.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "1,000 Lawyers and 10,000 Doctors Have Filed a Lawsuit for Violations of the Nuremberg Code - American Media Group", "description": "Background to the new Nuremberg Trials 2021 :A large team of more than 1,000 lawyers and over 10,000 medical experts, led by Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, has initiated legal proceedings against the CDC, WHO and the Davos Group for crimes against humanity.", "url": "https://amg-news.com/1000-lawyers-and-10000-doctors-have-filed-a-lawsuit-for-violations-of-the-nuremberg-code/", "site_name": "American Media Group", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/medeea23greere", "article:published_time": "2021-05-23T19:06:06+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-09-08T21:38:55+00:00", "image": "https://amg-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/corona.jpg", "image:width": "881", "image:height": "495", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Covid", "Nuremberg Trials 2021", "Nuremberg Code"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://8efe57rzq1pthlbxwlx9reikbz.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG23may", "https://8efe57rzq1pthlbxwlx9reikbz.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG23mayV", "https://8c133li5g3btdx2bjdtkma5r5x.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG23may", "https://8c133li5g3btdx2bjdtkma5r5x.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG23mayV", "https://46a889u3s2oyhtfq0l67rw6x7q.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG23may", "http://sistatiden.se/1000-advokater-och-10000-lakare-har-inlamnat-en-stamningsansokan-for-brott-mot-nurnbergkoden-den-nya-nurnberg-rattegangen-startar-den-3-juli-2021/?fbclid=IwAR0XPxm1PIU0XmIv4eeev1FcoZmZFnhAlWvK3q-EwhNYr_U3JcX-dIh4z08", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022"], "authors": ["Medeea Greere"], "publish_date": "2021-05-23T19:06:06+00:00"}
