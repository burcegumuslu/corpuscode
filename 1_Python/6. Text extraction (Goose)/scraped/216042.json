Yet , with 750,000,000 (on the way to one billion) #CDCwhistleblower Twitter impressions, it begs the question why this major story has not been investigated and given proper attention by mainstream media, enforcement agencies, and worldwide medical oversight boards.\n\nThe fact remains that in 2004, top CDC researchers saw a major statistically significant link to increased autism caused in their MMR vaccines trials and they blatantly covered it up.\n\nDue to the now infamous CDC whistle blower Dr. William Thompson\u2019s press release admitting purposeful neglect, what started as a bump in the night has now grown into a vicious monster with teeth under the beds of complicit CDC officials and a purposefully silent media. Angry parents are still angry and children are still being vaccine injured.\n\nAccording to a report by Ben Swann filed in September of 2014, Congressman Bill Posey\u2019s office claimed \u201cwe have received a very large number of documents and we are going through those documents now.\u201d However, since then not even a simple press conference has been called to inform the public.\n\nWhat was left of the CDC\u2019s public trust and integrity has been beaten up and trampled in the last five months by an MMR/autism research scandal, a botched Ebola response, and now an endless social media nightmare.\n\n\n\n In a recent interview Brian Hooker, PhD announced breaking information saying that he is in possession of \u201cseveral more data sets that I have received from the CDC to reanalyze (papers) regarding thimerosal exposure and autism as well as thimerosal exposure and other neuro-developmental abnormalities.\n\nThe CDC whistle blower has said and published twice that thirmerosal causes \u201cticks\u201d. Now we need to emphasize that \u201cticks\u201d are not a minor deal. Hooker goes on to say:\n\n\u201c\u2026by the way, incidences of \u201cticks\u201d is much, much higher than the autistic population.\n\n That story the CDC has really tried to bury and if you go to their own website they talk about thimerosal being safe except for issues around the injection site. Using their own data and using their own results that is simply not true.\u201d\n\nRegarding Hooker\u2019s reanalysis of the new CDC data concerning thimerosal in his possession he states that \u201cI am seeing statistically significant links across the board not only for autism and \u201cticks\u201d but also for lower performance on IQ tests among individuals who were exposed to higher doses of thirmerosal in their infant vaccines and speech and language delays.\u201d\n\n In closing, the CDC has just released its recent numbers on flu vaccine effectiveness for this season. According their own numbers, this year\u2019s flu vaccine is only 23% effective.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "American Public Officially Loses Faith in CDC", "description": "In 2004, top CDC researchers saw a major statistically significant link to increased autism and MMR vaccine - and it was blatantly covered up.", "url": "https://naturalsociety.com/american-public-officially-loses-faith-cdc/", "site_name": "Natural Society", "article:tag": "vaccines", "article:section": "Featured", "article:published_time": "2015-01-22T08:15:40+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-11T15:15:11+00:00", "updated_time": "2021-10-11T11:15:11-04:00", "image": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2015/01/vaccine_glove_735_350.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2015/01/vaccine_glove_735_350.jpg", "image:width": "735", "image:height": "350", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/cdc-whistleblower-comes-forward-admits-coverup-on-vaccine-link-to-autism/", "http://benswann.com/update-congressmans-office-in-possession-of-100000-cdc-whistleblower-documents/", "https://naturalsociety.com/cdc-whistle-blowers-evidence-vaccines-autism-may-silenced-forever/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/lax-us-guidelines-on-ebola-led-to-poor-hospital-training-experts-say.html", "http://www.robertscottbell.com/blog/cdcwhistleblower-at-750-million-brian-hooker-phd-mmr-autism-risk-ty-bollinger-outside-the-box-medical-kidnap-can-food-defense-more/", "http://news.yahoo.com/flu-vaccine-not-working-well-only-23-percent-180144538.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/lax-us-guidelines-on-ebola-led-to-poor-hospital-training-experts-say.html?_r=1"], "authors": ["Jefferey Jaxen"], "publish_date": "2015-01-22T08:15:40+00:00"}
