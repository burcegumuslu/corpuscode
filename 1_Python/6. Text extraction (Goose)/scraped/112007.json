Now, scientists have apparently created a vaccine that is 100 percent effective against one form of Ebola. From the New York Times story:\n\nIn a scientific triumph that will change the way the world fights a terrifying killer, an experimental Ebola vaccine tested on humans in the waning days of the West African epidemic has been shown to provide 100 percent protection against the lethal disease.\n\nThink of the human suffering and deaths that will be prevented! And, of course, like all modern medical breakthroughs, its development required animal testing:\n\nTests in monkeys showed that one shot protected all of them when it was given at least a week before they were given a high dose of Ebola. The shot even protected a few monkeys who received it a day after being infected with Ebola.\n\nI am sure those prominent animal rights activists and others who call animal research ineffective \u2014 and researchers \u201csadists\u201d \u2014 will be upset that the monkeys were so abused.\n\nPhoto credit: Linda Bartlett [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n Cross-posted at The Corner.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/mt-import/images/Monoclonal_antibodies3.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "An Ebola Vaccine \u2014 Thank Animal Testing | Evolution News", "description": "Ebola is a terrible disease that afflicts the poorest areas of our planet.", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2016/12/an_ebola_vaccin/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2019-03-05T19:11+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2016-12-23T20:33+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-03-05T19:11+00:00"}, "tags": ["science", "Research", "News", "Health & Wellness"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/health/ebola-vaccine.html?smid=tw-share", "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AMonoclonal_antibodies3.jpg", "http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/443305/ebola-vaccine-created"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016-12-23T20:33+00:00"}
