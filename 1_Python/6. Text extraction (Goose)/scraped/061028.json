Perhaps Pfizer already has a shot to sell us for the side effects, as well.\n\n \n\n Despite the obvious and now well-documented and life-threatening side effects caused by the jabs, the shots are still mandated in many places. Maine Gov. Janet Mills is violating federal Title VII law by refusing to allow any religious exemptions to the shots. Anyone who refuses will lose their license to practice in her state. What Mills is doing is illegal and Liberty Counsel is putting a stop to it.\n\n \n\n This week we filed a brief with the Court of Appeals in our case, Alicia Lowe, et al., v. Janet Mills, et al., which could become one of our next cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Read on.\n\nBy definition, \"gain of function\" research manipulates viruses, making them more contagious and able to cross species barriers. It is an extremely dangerous field of study, as a newly created virus could escape the lab and become a super virus that natural immune systems cannot easily combat.\n\nFor decades, researchers have warned that such \"studies\" had the potential of creating a man-made global pandemic.\n\nTen years ago, one such \"gain of function\" bioengineered virus did escape the lab, creating the \"bird flu\" epidemic of 2012. As a result, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was forced to implement strict guidelines for overseeing any such projects, putting a moratorium on \"gain of function\" research grants.\n\nInterestingly, in a 2012 paper published in mBio, the open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, Dr. Anthony Fauci claimed that \"the benefits of such experiments and the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks.\"\n\nThanks to the incestuous relationship between Big Pharma and the federal government, Liberty Counsel has been fighting in the courts for the right to refuse these shots. Our battle continues on multiple fronts.\n\nFast-forward to the present, and \"gain of function\" experiments are still frowned upon by much of the scientific community\u2014except Pfizer, which has simply changed the language.\n\nIn an undercover video just released by Project Veritas, a Pfizer executive admitted that Pfizer is deliberately mutating the coronavirus to make the virus more potent in order to sell MORE vaccines.\n\nJordan Trishton Walker, M.D., is the director of Research & Development, Strategic Operations and MRNA Scientific Planning at Pfizer. While having drinks with the undercover journalist, Dr. Walker revealed Pfizer's grand scheme.\n\n\"You're not supposed to do gain of function with viruses,\" Dr. Walker told the journalist. Instead, Walker and his colleagues call this dangerous research \"directed evolution.\" What does \"directed evolution\" mean exactly? Dr. Walker explains, saying, \"We do these selected structure mutations to try to see if we can make them more potent.\"\n\nThat sounds a lot like gain of function ...\n\nBut, he continued, \"Don't tell anyone this, by the way. You have to promise you won't tell anyone, okay? So, the way it would work is like we put them in\u2014the virus\u2014in these monkeys. And then we successively, like, cause them to keep infecting each other. And we collect serial samples from them, and then, the ones that are more infectious, to like, the virus, we'll put them in another monkey, and you just constantly actively mutate it ... You can now force it to mutate in a certain way you want it.\"\n\nDr. Walker only recently graduated from medical school at the University of Texas Southwestern in 2018. He came to Pfizer from Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which is best known for increasing profit lines in major corporations by identifying and capitalizing on what BCG calls \"cash cows.\"\n\nIn the undercover video, Dr. Walker further explains Pfizer's strategy, saying, \"So that's why they're thinking like, if you do it controlled in a lab, then we say this is a new epitope, and so if it comes out later on, in the public, then you already have a vaccine kind of working.\"\n\nWhen the journalist notes that this would be a lucrative business, Dr. Walker giggled and agreed, saying, \"Yeah, if it works,\" before adding, \"Either way it's going to be a cash cow. COVID will probably be a cash cow for us for a while going forward,\" Dr. Walker declared before giggling again.\n\nIt appears that Pfizer may be creating viruses to force new vaccines on the world to keep its latest \"cash cow\" well fed.\n\nMeanwhile, the shot mandate presses on, regardless of the corruption that fostered the shots in the first place, and regardless of the now-proven life- ending side effects.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 2021, Dr. Nirav Shah, former director of Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, amended the state's administrative regulation to eliminate the ability of health care workers to request and obtain a religious exemption and accommodation from the COVID shot mandate. However, federal law requires that employers MUST consider religious accommodations.\n\nBut Gov. Janet Mills, whom we sued two years ago for unlawfully forcing all churches to close, does not care about religious freedom or federal law. Two years after the \"two weeks to flatten the curve\" mantra, Mills still demands that any employer that fails to enforce her unlawful mandate will lose their license to do business in Maine.\n\nLiberty Counsel represents health care workers in Maine who have sincerely held religious beliefs that prevent them from accepting the COVID shots.\n\nThis week, we filed a brief with the Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, we continue defending military service members against Joe Biden's shot mandates.\n\nFor the original article, visit our content partners at lc.org.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!
