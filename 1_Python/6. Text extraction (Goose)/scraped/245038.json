The news came on the same day that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was granted full approval from the FDA, and more than five months after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was fully approved.\n\nNovavax is requesting that its NVX-CoV2373 protein-based vaccine be authorized for people ages 18 and up, pointing out in a press release that its clinical trials show that the vaccine has a 90% efficacy rate and a \u201creassuring\u201d safety profile.\n\n\u201cWe believe our vaccine offers a differentiated option built on a well-understood protein-based vaccine platform that can be an alternative to the portfolio of available vaccines to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Stanley C. Erck, president and CEO of Novavax, said in a statement.\n\nSome people have questioned why another COVID-19 vaccine is needed at this point, but infectious disease doctors argue that this vaccine fills a void. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nHow does the Novavax vaccine work?\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is a protein-based vaccine that\u2019s created from the genetic sequence of the original SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene is inserted into an insect virus, called a baculovirus. That virus infects insect cells, which pump out the spike protein. Then, the spike proteins are harvested and combined with an adjuvant (an ingredient that creates a stronger immune response in your body), explains William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine uses a more traditional approach,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. \u201cIt\u2019s taken the critical part of the spike protein and used it to make the vaccine. The body responds to that part of the spike protein and makes antibodies.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine is designed to be given in two 0.5 milliliter doses, delivered 21 days apart.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine works slightly differently from other vaccines. Those include:\n\u2022 mRNA vaccines: These vaccines encode a part of the spike protein that's found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains. The mRNA vaccines use pieces of that encoded protein to spark an immune response from your body and develop antibodies. Your body eventually eliminates the protein and the mRNA, but the antibodies stick around.\n\u2022 Vector vaccines: These vaccines use an inactivated virus as a carrier to deliver proteins that your body recognizes as a threat. As a result, your body makes antibodies against those proteins. The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is an adenovirus vaccine, which means it uses an inactivated common cold virus.\n\u2022 Whole killed vaccines: These vaccines use a killed version of the germ that causes a disease, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) explains. These also prompt an immune response in your body but they don\u2019t usually create as much immunity as those that use live viruses. As a result, you may need several doses over time to have ongoing immunity. Common inactivated vaccines include the flu shot, hepatitis A shot, polio vaccine, and rabies vaccine.\n\nWhat does the data say about the Novavax vaccine?\n\nNovavax has done two Phase 3 clinical trials: The PREVENT-19 trial, which enrolled about 30,000 people in the U.S. and Mexico, and another trial that had almost 15,000 participants in the U.K.\n\nIn the U.K. trial, there were 56 cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group and six cases in the vaccinated group, leading an efficacy rate of 89.3%. In the PREVENT-19 trial, 63 people who received a placebo shot got COVID-19 and 14 of those who were vaccinated contracted the virus, giving the vaccine a 90.4% efficacy rate.\n\nThe most common side effects from the trials included:\n\nWhy is the Novavax vaccine needed now?\n\nThere are already two COVID-19 vaccines that are fully approved by the FDA for use\u2014Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech\u2014and another (Johnson & Johnson) that is operating under an EUA. So why is another COVID-19 vaccine needed?\n\nThomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, acknowledges that, \u201cwe now have enough COVID-19 vaccine to vaccinate everyone we want.\u201d But, he says, \u201cNovavax has a chance to be a niche vaccine for those individuals that believe the mRNA vaccines are \u2018experimental.\u2019\u201d\n\nNovavax\u2019s more traditional approach to vaccination \u201cmay be more palatable to some,\u201d Dr. Russo says. \u201cAs a result,\u201d he adds, \u201cwe may be able to move the dial with these people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also just good to have more options, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThe larger the menu for COVID vaccines, the better,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Schaffner says the Novavax vaccine can also be a helpful option for \u201cthe very small minority\u201d of people who are allergic to ingredients in the mRNA vaccines. And, he says, more ways of fighting COVID-19 are always better.\n\n\u201cIn general, we always like to have more vaccine manufacturers, particularly in pandemic circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cWho knows when a new variant will surface and more options will be needed?\u201d\n\nNovavax's clinical trial data and EUA application has been submitted to the FDA. It's unclear when it will be granted, if it is at all.\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
