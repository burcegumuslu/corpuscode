Is AIDS murder? You decide dear reader. I'm just sharing with you the information I have discovered. It certainly seems strange and more than coincidental that AIDS suddenly appeared in the latter half of the 20th century. The most straight forward evidence of this are the progress reports of the U.S. Special Virus Cancer Program, as exposed by Dr. Len Horowitz (www.tetrahedron.org) and Dr. Boyd Graves and a video called \"AIDS CURE: U.S. Patent #5676977\" that used to be on Google video. The killer is that the U.S. has patented a cure for AIDS (www.uspto.gov, patent # 5676977). Large \"humanitarian\" organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and Samaritan's Purse don't prioritize finding a CURE for AIDS! This is not surprising considering that the heads of these major organizations are SNAKES and disgusting liars. The patent # is 5676977. He can tell people where to get the infusion to cure them, as he received it himself in Tijuana. This is real; but no one cares enough to do anything about it.\n\nAphios Granted US Patent For Combination HIV Latency Nanotherapeutic Towards an HIV Cure\n\nWOBURN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aphios Corporation today announced that it was issued US Patent No. 10,493,030 for the treatment of HIV latency towards an HIV cure.\n\n \n\n Aphios granted US Patent for the treatment of HIV latency towards an HIV cure. #HIV/AIDS is a pandemic on par with the Black Plaque and the Spanish Flu. The end can sometimes seem to be a long way away, but a cure for HIV is realizable within our lifetime\n\n \n\n Tweet this\n\n Since the start of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in 1982, over 32 million people have died from AIDS and there were approximately 37.9 million people living with HIV in 2018. In the United States, an estimated 1.1 million people are currently living with HIV and approximately 40,000 new infections occur each year. AIDS-related mortality has fortunately declined by 33% since 2010. Even with these encouraging statistics, the total number of persons infected increases about 1 million per year in the absence of a cure since the annual average rate of new infections is approx. 1.7 million and the average number of deaths globally is approx. 770,000. A cure for HIV is urgently needed to bend the curve towards ending this pandemic affecting more than 38 million people worldwide.\n\n \n\n HIV infects several cell types during the course of infection and progression to AIDS. Antiretroviral (ART) is very effective in controlling replication of the virus in most cells. HIV, however, establishes latent long-term infection in a small pool of memory CD4+ T (immune) and other cells, which contain integrated but transcriptionally silent HIV provirus. These cellular virus reservoirs are a potential source of rapid HIV virus reactivation and progression to AIDS if ART is stopped for any reason. There are no commercially available drugs for treating HIV latency and/or curing HIV.\n\n \n\n The Aphios \u2019030 patent is for a combination of two Latency Reversal Agents (LRAs) -- a Protein Kinase C (PKC) modulator of the anti-tumor class, \u2018Bryoids\u2019 and a Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor co-encapsulated in long-circulating pegylated immuno-nanosomes to purge latent HIV from cellular reservoirs. Bryoids, such as Bryostatin-1, activate cellular transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB which transcribes latent HIV into active HIV virus. The HDAC inhibitor removes acetyl groups affecting gene expression and increases accessibility of NF-\u03baB improving transcription efficacy. By combining a PKC modulator and HDAC inhibitor in the same nanoparticle, both drugs reach their intended target simultaneously. These nanoparticles can be coated with targeting ligands to reach their target and with anti-PDL-1 nanobodies to keep CD4+ T-cells activated for clearance of re-activated HIV-1 virus. These immuno-nanosomes will reduce systemic toxicities while pegylation increases nanoparticle biological residence time to increase therapeutic efficacy and overall therapeutic index.\n\n \n\n Dr. Trevor P, Castor, CEO, Aphios and inventor of the issued patent states that \u201cHIV/AIDS is a pandemic we are still battling on par with pandemics of the past such as the 14th century Bubonic Plague and the 20th century Spanish Flu. The end can sometimes seem to be a long way away, but a cure for HIV is realizable within our lifetime. APH-0812 is designed to activate latent HIV reservoirs for clearance by ARVs and/or the patient\u2019s immune system, and eliminate the long-term economic burden of ARV drug costs, associated drug-induced side effects and social stigma.\u201d READ MORE\n\nThe Origin of AIDS and HIV May Not Be What You Have Learned\n\nMost people believe that the origin of HIV, the AIDS virus, derives from some natural evolutionary event. Key among these HIV origin theories is the so called \"cut hunter theory\" in which a human, allegedly African native, received a bloody wound or infected splash while preparing a chimpanzee carrying a similar virus (i.e., ). Most recent research, along with the scientific consensus, holds that the origin of HIV and AIDS could never have happened this way.\n\nIn 2001, The Royal Society of London's conference proceedings, which sought to determine the initial cause of AIDS and the origin of HIV, were published for the world to behold. The most highly respected scientists and academicians debated the possibility that HIV-1, the most widespread and deadly human AIDS virus, evolved from accidental vaccine contaminations and subsequent transmissions to mostly to African villagers. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) received the focus of interest here since that vaccine was partially derived from growing live polio viruses in monkey kidney cells that have historically proven to be contaminated with cancer viruses such as SV40 -- the 40th monkey virus ever discovered -- currently linked by medical scientists to widespread human cancers. By the end of the symposium, the esteemed delegates concluded the HIV origin and AIDS was not likely to have come from polio vaccine transmissions as chimpanzees were not proven to have been used during the manufacture of this vaccine.\n\nMore importantly, among the most respected of all HIV/AIDS origin theorists, the U.S. Government's chief DNA sequence analyst at the Los Alamos Laboratory in , Dr. Gerald Myers, reported with his colleagues that the origin of HIV could not have begun with \"cut hunters\" or other single isolated cross species transmissions (called \"zoonosis\"). He reported that genetic sequencing studies prove some \"punctuated origin of AIDS event\" took place during the mid-1970s giving rise, virtually simultaneously, to at least ten different HIV \"clades\" (or genetic subtypes) associated with ten different distinguishable AIDS epidemics in Africa alone. The most likely cause of this widespread bizarre zoonosis was some man-made (i.e., iatrogenic) event involving chimpanzees, this group reckoned.\n\nMyers and his colleagues offered the following best explanation for the origin of HIV: \"It is not far-fetched,\" they wrote, \"to imagine the ten or so clades deriving from a single animal (perhaps immunosuppressed and possessing a swarm of variants) [as might have been the case with chimpanzees used in the process of vaccine manufacture] or from a few animals that might have belonged to a single troop or might have been gang-caged together. The number of animals required is secondary to the extent of variation in the source at the time of the zoonotic or iatrogenic event. The [vaccine] hypothesis makes a case for such a punctuated origin . . .\" (See: Burr T, Hyman JM and Myers G. The origin of acquired immune deficiency syndrome: Darwinian or Lamarchkian? Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2001) 356:877-887.)\n\nThe answer to this question was singularly advanced by a Harvard-degreed independent investigator, Dr. Leonard Horowitz in the award winning book Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola -- Nature, Accident or Intentional? (Tetrahedron Press, 1998; 1-888-508-4787; http:www.tetrahedron.org) Dr. Horowitz unearthed and reprinted stunning scientific documents and National Institutes of Health contracts proving that chimpanzees, contaminated with numerous viruses, were used to produce hundreds of hepatitis B vaccine doses administered to central African Blacks along with homosexual men in New York City at precisely the time Dr. Myers and colleagues claim the origin of HIV \"punctuated event\" occurred.\n\nFor a FEATURE ARTICLE on this topic by Dr. Leonard Horowitz, click here.\n\nSOURCE: The Origin of AIDS and HIV May Not Be What You Have Learned", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.tetrahedron.org", "patented_aids_cure.htm", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200128005183/en/Aphios-Granted-Patent-Combination-HIV-Latency-Nanotherapeutic#:~:text=--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aphios,latency towards an HIV cure.&text=Since the start of the,living with HIV%", "http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/cgi-bin/store/agora.cgi?&p_id=0012", "http:www.tetrahedron.org", "http://www.originofaids.com/articles/early.htm", "http://www.originofaids.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
