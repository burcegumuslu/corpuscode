It is an opportunity we have never had before, or may never have a game. So we must use all the levers we have at our disposal, knowing that each and every one of us has a vital role to play.\n\nNow is the time to think what history would say about this crisis. And now is the time for all of us to define our own role. What is it that would make it so that history would look at this crisis, as the great opportunity for reset\n\nwas ready to get controversial? This is going to be the most important topic we\u2019ve ever covered. The most important at the moment, almost the most important time actually. I always stick to occult symbolism and pop culture and the movies and the music. And the aliens like I try to have a good time. But subject at hand today goes into uncharted territory for my shows. We\u2019re gonna talk about a little bit on the Chinese Communist globalist trying to take over the world. Because you know who\u2019s right alex jones is right. He\u2019s right. Oh, there\u2019s all time he was right. I didn\u2019t know that. But we\u2019re going to talk about it cuz I\u2019m not good at this. Global geopolitics. Like it\u2019s such a futile effort following the politics and these movers and shakers and these, these groups that try laterals and the CF powers and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and all these people. It\u2019s a lot. I mean, this is a lifetime of research that Alex Jones has done. That\u2019s a you know why he gets into it so deep. But like, for me, that\u2019s a little too much. But I haven\u2019t deep so deep. It put my butt to sleep on these globalists on what they\u2019re doing, and it opened up my eyes. It shocked me. I\u2019m literally I\u2019m shaking, you should see my hand I\u2019m shaking right now. We\u2019re going to talk about it though. And here\u2019s the thing, it What follows is a show on the great reset. If you haven\u2019t already deduce that, we\u2019re gonna talk about the great reset. Specifically on this first episode, on the free feed here, we\u2019re going to talk about Klaus Schwab and his book COVID-19, the great reset, they lay it all out exactly what they\u2019re doing. And if you want to support my research and support the show, you know where to go. And those people that do support, they\u2019re gonna get extra episodes. We\u2019re gonna go deeper. We\u2019re going to go into class Rob second book. Well, it was sorry, that\u2019s a misnomer. His fourth industrial revolution book, I read that I read that book, I read the COVID-19 great reset book, I got notes. I\u2019m gonna save you a lot of time on I\u2019m going to go through and explain it to you. But on that second episode, like we\u2019re going to do like maybe four or five episodes on this. I\u2019m going to throw the first one on the free feed and I know heavy is going to be tuned out because this isn\u2019t that fun. I\u2019m gonna make it fun though. And it\u2019s actually incredibly important actually the most important topic I\u2019ve ever covered, if you can believe that. But on the second episode that\u2019s going to go on my feeds like patreon.com slash Illuminati watcher or rockfon comm slash creators slash Isaac. I\u2019m going to put you know that\u2019s where I put my bonus shows for supporters on each network, whichever one you like better. The second episode, we\u2019re going to about transhumanism five g class Schwab\u2019s Fourth Industrial Revolution book, then part three, I believe, I\u2019m still fleshing out the details here. We\u2019re going to do or talk about your boy Jay Dyer. Oh, yeah. Jay Dyer. None of a kind words though. This isn\u2019t a drama section. He actually had a great video on the great reset. On he did a he hosted Alex Jones\u2019s show, he did the fourth hour. And he broke down the great reset over 45 minutes and I watched it and I thought, My God, what are we in for? And I fact checked everything. Because like I said, I read the books. And if you you know, if you only listen to the first episode and we part ways after this journey, go check out Jay show on that because he breaks down the great reset too. And he\u2019s not wrong. We\u2019re gonna in that third episode, we\u2019ll talk about the World Economic Forum and the eight points that they talk about the eight point plan and the communist agenda. Like I said, this is gonna be the most important topics you\u2019ve ever heard. For me, this is some of the most important research I\u2019ve ever done. But like, Is it fun? No. For me, like the research like this is very, it makes you mad. It makes you scared. It makes everything a lot more serious. And, boy, I\u2019d rather walk watch Katy Perry videos. Let me tell you that much. Then on the fourth episode, we\u2019re gonna talk about Bill Cooper Behold a Pale Horse. He talked about this in the 80s and 90s By the way, he predicted all of this it\u2019s all true. The truth is always no right? And Bill Cooper knew it he told you about it. That\u2019s gonna be a good episode. I was gonna be fun. Because Bill Cooper is a no g that dudes Oh gee, he read pilled me first red pill via Bill Cooper then I\u2019ll do like a part five. I think we\u2019d like conclusion. Social dilemmas, what to do all that stuff. And I don\u2019t know if you follow me on the Instagram. I did a nice little video. There. You can still watch it. I posted it on December 3 30 minute video me shaming people into wearing masks. I know that sounds crazy, doesn\u2019t it? Because the truth community is adamantly against the mask. And I get it. I don\u2019t want to wear the thing either. It feels very controlling. But there\u2019s a reason for that. And you got to listen to all these episodes to understand why because I assure you, they the globalists, the elites are doing a chess move on us. And Boyle boy, they\u2019re putting your own fate in your hands. You don\u2019t want to wear the mask well. Get ready for the Chinese Communist cashless system that come your way. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s next. clash. Clash Royale is going to shop with his leader hosen and his big kielbasa and he\u2019s gonna make you he\u2019s gonna make you call him daddy. It sounds absurd. I\u2019m telling after all of this research I\u2019ve been doing for days and days and days. This is real, this is happening. And censorships real. That\u2019s gonna be part of this agenda. That\u2019s why I tell you, you got to sign up for my email newsletter. Because believe you me one day, you\u2019re gonna look for your boy Isaac on your podcast feed are your socials and I\u2019m no longer gonna be there. lunati watcher.com slash start. If you go to Illuminati watch.com co star here. And when you sign up for the email newsletter, I will give you a free copy of my first book a grand unified conspiracy theory, the Illuminati Ancient Aliens and pop culture. It\u2019s a good time you get I\u2019m gonna lose. I own the email, I pay for it every month, hundreds of dollars a pay for this thing? Join the crew. It\u2019s mean you, buddy. Alright. Let\u2019s talk about okay. And let me preface this thing because I got to kind of lay the foundations, this is a lot of information. You have to understand, maybe you\u2019re new to the truth or community, I don\u2019t know. But you have to understand there\u2019s always been a desire to centralize control into a global one world government, the New World Order, whatever you want to call it. And they advertise globalization as the solution to problems in the world to global problems, which are, in fact, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re fake the problems globally. I\u2019m just saying that they use them to their advantage to centralize authority. Now it could be like, and it could be like when a like a company buys out another one. And they make it worse by like cutting out jobs and making people do more with less. And then the workers are pissed off and they get rid of all the expertise that has been there for 20 years, because they don\u2019t like paying them that much. And now the company is even worse than it was before. That\u2019s what I argue this would be like, just so you know, I\u2019m on Team pro America here is about as patriotic as I\u2019m ever gonna get with this show. Because I love America, and I love her for her freedom and her beauty. But they want to take that all away. Klaus Schwab wants to take it all away. And when you read his books, it\u2019s insidious. Because when you read the books, you think, Oh, this guy seems all right. I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s just saying like, Hey, you know, pollution is a problem and climate change is a problem. Let\u2019s you know, let\u2019s have a fair world. Let\u2019s lift people up. Which like the liberal granola sodomy is like, yeah, okay, I dig that. But as you\u2019ll hear when we go through all this stuff, It\u2019s an insidious plan. And they need to destroy America\u2019s freedom first, that\u2019s what they need. But when we talk about all these show up in the course of these episodes about the great reset, I guess it\u2019s gonna be like five episodes on the great reset. You\u2019re going to understand why the viruses here you\u2019ll know why they\u2019re orchestrating a certain response from you. They\u2019re going to understand, you\u2019ll even know why the aliens are going to be the final threat to courses into the New World Order. If we don\u2019t bow down before then, you will find out why the Illuminati globalist when all this to happen, why cash has to go why America must crumble to her knees. That big beautiful bald eagle needs to be down underneath cryin. You\u2019ll know why Ilan musk and these nerds want to send you to other planets instead of fixing our own. And you\u2019ll be shocked. You\u2019ll be shocked when I reveal to you that these globalists, they it\u2019s not personal. They don\u2019t want to kill you. They don\u2019t care. They hate you. What do they care? You\u2019re nothing to them. They just think you\u2019re stupid and you need control to do the right thing. That\u2019s that\u2019s what it is. And ultimately, you know, it\u2019s like, Look, I don\u2019t disagree with all these facts, observations, the science things that these globalists are pushing. I don\u2019t disagree with all of them. But what I don\u2019t trust is the people pushing the agenda, these globalist elites. You know, that World Economic Forum, it\u2019s run by like the 1000 richest capitalist corporations and and they\u2019re gonna come in and tell us how to be more fair, nice to each other. I don\u2019t think so. How do you think Bill Gates got rich? He goes from being nice to people. I mean, these same people, they out there Oh, yeah, GMOs are so safe. to stab ease are so safe. Christianity\u2019s there\u2019s a big problem. It\u2019s in the way of real progress. I disagree with almost everything they say. Why would I trust their ideas that climate change is real? I know it\u2019s hard, right? I have a hard time. Because I do buy into some of their arguments of population explosion via romance, explosion, natural resources being squeezed middle class being squeezed into oblivion, climate change all this stuff. I just don\u2019t trust them to be the solution. That\u2019s the difference. Okay. Now, there you go. That was a 10 minute preamble. For what follows if you join us on our on the long version, would it be like five hours at least? This first show might be damn five hours. I got notes in this book. So what you\u2019re listening to now is the great reset Part One whet your appetite and see if you want to dive deep with us if you want dive deep join us patreon.com slash Illuminati watcher or rockfon.com slash creator slash Isaac, you\u2019ve heard my spiel on both of those whichever one you like, I don\u2019t care. pick your poison. Some people like one over the other. It doesn\u2019t matter to me, I just appreciate your support in any way. I did read to Klaus Schwab\u2019s books and of Behold a Pale Horse and oh my god I\u2019ve been so I\u2019ve been deep in the rabbit hole, folks. So anyways, let\u2019s get onto the Klaus Schwab and the Illuminati globalist agenda, part one here. Now the sequence because I got to lay this out, right. What prompted me to get into this topic because this is a little off brand. Okay. There are so many troopers in the community talking about the great reset. And I appreciate respect the work of my man Jay Dyer. He spent so much time on it. I thought let me give it a whirl. Let me see if I agree with him. Because I don\u2019t think me and Jay agree on everything we agree on a lot. A shocking amount of similarities is almost like he\u2019s my long lost brother. I don\u2019t think we have agreements and everything though. And as you heard on the I did a rock Finn Show with Jay. And we went into why he was hanging out with Alex Jones and out there, you know, screaming through the bullhorn in Georgia at the pro Trump\u2019s stop the steel election and all that stuff. And like you know my stance like i don\u2019t i don\u2019t think Trump is the guy I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the guy to bring this all down. But I get where people are coming from where they buy into it right on some levels. I just I just haven\u2019t seen anything to make me believe them. So I you know, I wanted to see I went into this they can Okay, the great reset. This is some conservative fearmongering of these Chinese communist globalist because the conservatives are always so scared of socialism. It\u2019s such a dirty word. But now I see. Now I get it. I get it now. And it took a Lot of wrangling and I was intrigued to research this Believe it or not by an image of Carl Schwab that was floating around where he\u2019s wearing this bizarre, wacky, wacky outfit looking like Dr. Evil and to defend him it was a college graduation when you go to college graduations, which I did, right. I\u2019ve been indoctrinated. When I went for I walked at Penn State for my masters. And there were some Bizarro Harry Potter looking costumes going on. So what I saw Klaus Schwab, I was like, man, why are they picking on man like this? He didn\u2019t. He just had a college thing. But anyway, it was intriguing photo and I thought let me see these truth is right. Why they why are they doing this? So I bought his book COVID-19 the great reset. And I read it and I thought it was pretty smart book. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really see the fear in it. And that proves how insidious this whole thing is. You\u2019ll see when we peel everything back. I\u2019m gonna be Do you see birdbox? You seem to mean for birdbox I\u2019m the old guy. ripping your eyes open. See, see the truth. Just beautiful. That\u2019s me right now. And when you guys are smart, you guys have been doing that to me. Honestly, I get more flak from people for my belief systems. But now I get it. Right. And I\u2019ve always I\u2019ve always, you know, like I said, Bill Cooper and David red billed me they were always into this global octopus of control thing. So I believed it. I didn\u2019t see how the pieces fit together. Now I see. Now I get it. Oh, let\u2019s see. Yeah, like I said, Let me see Baba Baba. Talk about the global cabal. I talked about that. Let\u2019s get into it. Let\u2019s get into COVID-19 the great reset. And I\u2019m telling you right now I got I got so many notes. So many notes. I\u2019m going to try to bust through this. And mega fun for you. And fun for me. I\u2019m gonna read you. Sure I read you on a German accent the whole time? Or? I mean, I seriously have at least 10 pages of notes from this book. So yeah, this is this is good. All right, page 11. I\u2019m on page 11. I\u2019m going to read you from the book. But the existential crisis also favored that sounds like Bora. I sent every voice it sounds like Bora. I forget it. No, no German accent for you. But deep existential crisis also favor introspection, it can harbor the potential for transformation. The Fault Lines of the world most notably social divides, lack of fairness, absence of cooperation, failure of global governance and leadership now lie exposed as never before. And people can feel the time for reinvention has come in new world will emerge the contours of which are for us to both imagine and draw. Now, what he\u2019s saying. And this is a I might have just keep harping on it. But he\u2019s saying the virus basically is like any other crisis that can\u2019t let a good crisis go to waste. They\u2019re going to use it to create the new world, right? That\u2019s the great reset. And he\u2019s saying, This is the time for transformation. That\u2019s why from day one, they said all new normal coming your way, and things will never be the same again. And right from the get go. I always thought What do you mean things aren\u2019t gonna be the same ever again. We\u2019re gonna deal with this crap and then move on. What are you talking about? But then after reading the book, I understand now. It is true. It is very true there. This is the new normal. And we\u2019ll explain as we go. But listen to what he says here. The Tama the the fault lines of the world. He talks about social divides lack of fairness, absence of cooperation, failure of global governance and leadership. He\u2019s saying like, Look, the human popular mankind is run around on Earth. They don\u2019t listen to anything. You\u2019re telling us a deadly virus and they\u2019re like, screw you. I\u2019m going out. And right or wrong, we can we could argue about the death rates. We could argue about the masks, but we\u2019re not going to. That\u2019s all he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s saying look, there\u2019s this big problem. It\u2019s time for transformation. Okay, next quote. At the at the time of writing June 2020. The pandemic continues to worsen globally. Many of us are pondering when things will return to normal. The short response is never keep reading here. radical changes of such consequence are coming that some pundits have referred to a before Coronavirus bc and after Coronavirus ac era. We will continue to be surprised by both the rap rapidity and unexpected nature. Of these changes, as they conflate with each other, they will provoke second, third, fourth and more order consequences cascading effects, unforeseen outcomes. In doing so they will shape a new normal radically different from the one we will be progressively leaving behind. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s saying is to simpletons like me, I think, why does anything have to change? It\u2019s just a virus, like many viruses before. But with the lockdowns with the economy shutting down with the ripple effects, and and here\u2019s a good example. I went to the store to get some cilantro. And guess what, there\u2019s no cilantro. Because COVID because of California, wildfires, fill in the blank. There\u2019s people in these factories and they get sick, and then they spread it to other people. Now, there\u2019s less people working. I mean, everything takes longer with COVID. Right. And what that results in is an economic void that some companies will fill through automation, Ai, ingenuity, innovations, whatever. Look at telework, right? I didn\u2019t get to telework before now, I\u2019m teleworking 100% of the time, and it\u2019s beautiful. I love it. Now, let\u2019s keep breeding. Because of their inherently disruptive nature. epidemics throughout history have proven to be a force for lasting and often radical change, sparking riots, causing population clashes, military defeats, but also triggering innovations, redrawing national boundaries, and often paving the way for revolutions. outbreaks forced empires to change course like the Byzantine Empire when struck by the plague of Justinian in 541, and some even to disappear altogether. When Aztec and Inca emperors died with most of their subjects from European germs. So rightfully so, he\u2019s making a good point here. That when when the Europeans came over with the germs, all the mass tax they were they were probably marched around. And the smart ones were like, oh, you\u2019re coming to white folk, it\u2019s time for a new normal and all the dummies were like, what are you gonna we\u2019re just gonna keep doing what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re gonna keep like, you know, making chocolate and sacrificing kids to the gods. And they\u2019re just gonna be white people here now to was a big deal. And next thing you know, boom, they\u2019re all dead. From syphilis or whatever. Keep it moving. Here we go. Deus. There\u2019s nothing new about the confinement and lock downs imposed upon much of the world to manage COVID-19. They have been common practice for centuries. The earliest forms of confinement came with the quarantines instituted in an effort to contain the Black Death, that between 1347 and 1351 killed about a third of all Europeans. Coming from the word corn tanah Cora, Cora anta, which means 40 in Italian, the idea of confining people for 40 days originated without the authorities really understanding what they wanted to contain. But the measures were one of the first forms of institutionalized public health that helped legitimize the accretion of power by the modern state, the period of 40 days as no Medical Foundation, it was chosen for symbolic and religious reasons. both the Old and New Testaments often refer to the number 40 in the context of purification, in particular, the 40 days of Lent, and the 40 days of the flood in Genesis. So he said, A is a sort of a power move, be the core team, there\u2019s a spiritual implication and remember earlier, they were calling BC and AC before COVID, after COVID. How blasphemous Is that right? But that is a What do you call, like a litmus test of the bigger picture? They need to destroy Christianity, I always say it. And this is just a metaphor of that. The virus to them. Again, if you look at like gnostic conversion ideas, the virus is their savior because the virus will enable them to cause this transformation to happen. So when they talk about the 4040 days of the in the Bible, like this is this is it for them? They love it. They\u2019re psychopaths. World Class, Rob has been watching too much shayzon porn. Let\u2019s keep reading. None fits the region pattern of the human suffering and economic destruction caused by the current pandemic. So what he\u2019s saying in the book, he says, He basically saying COVID is going to have a larger impact that all the events that he lists out, he lists out like 911 Spanish flu, the Great Depression. I mean, and I\u2019m thinking is this guy lost his damn mind. The Spanish Flu killed like 50 million. People, how\u2019s COVID gonna have a larger impact? Well, only you only understand the severity and impact of this when you research people like Bill Cooper, who break down why this is happening. And again, I know this is like I keep teasing you with the thing, but like, it\u2019s kind of a deep idea of, I mean, the short version is they want to usher in this new totalitarian socialist economy or world global government, where they divvy out the resources fairly to save you, your neighbor and Mother Earth. That\u2019s the short version, but I have to go through a lot of information to get there before. I mean, it just sounds like Oh, you\u2019re being a paranoid conspiracy guy. And I\u2019m telling you, and you know, me, right, I\u2019m a pretty rational, honest dude. I\u2019ll tell you when there\u2019s levels of how much I believe something, I believe this one. Next, the pandemic will accelerate systemic changes that were already apparent prior to the crisis, the partial retreat from globalization, the growing decoupling between the US and China the acceleration of automation concerns about heightened surveillance, the growing appeal of well being policies, rising nationalism, and the subsequent fear of immigration, the growing power of tech, the necessity for firms to have an even stronger online presence among many others. It might just provoke changes that would have already seemed inconceivable before the pandemic such as new forms of monetary policy, like helicopter money, the reconsideration recalibration of some of our social priorities, and an augmented search for the common good as a policy objective, the notion of fairness and acquiring political potency, radical welfare and taxation measures and drastic geopolitical realignment, realignment, so. And you might I had to look up helicopter money, I didn\u2019t know what that was, it\u2019s like dropping money from helicopter like the, the stimulus checks, right? The Trump box. So you seen that he\u2019s saying, and again, this supports the idea that there will be a new normal, that what a pandemic does is it is an accelerator, an amplifier, if you will. So, we were already retrieved from globalization here in America. Right? And then Brexit to Well, now it\u2019s gonna be even worse. Which is a good thing, but I think it\u2019s a good thing. I mean, I don\u2019t know macro economics, but to the globalist, it\u2019s not a good thing. They don\u2019t want that. Rising nationalism, he\u2019s saying that\u2019s gonna get worse, which I mean, it kind of has, right. I mean, you got all these groups out there that are national list esque. Fear of immigration, like, yeah, you don\u2019t want to start letting everyone in the growing power of tech, that was exacerbated. In fact, by the pandemic, look at zoom, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna know what zoom was before this thing hit. Let\u2019s keep let\u2019s keep reading society, I\u2019m only on page 19. Good Lord, here we go. Societies could be poised to become either more egalitarian or more authoritarian, or geared towards more solidarity or more individualism, favoring the interest of the few or the many economies when they recover could take the path of more inclusivity and be more attuned to the needs of the global commons. Or they could return to functioning as they did before you get the point, we should take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine our world, in a bid to make it better and more resilient one as it emerges on the other side of the crisis, in an interdependent world, risks amplify each other and in doing so have cascading effects. He\u2019s saying, look, we\u2019re all connected globally, the risks are faced globally. You know, we get our we get our goods from other countries. I mean, somewhere in this book, he says the US gets 97% of its antibiotics from China. Did you know that I didn\u2019t know that. It was a Global Connections. Therefore, all the risks are faced globally, which is kind of what he\u2019s saying when he says the COVID is different. It\u2019s different from 911, the Spanish flu, we\u2019re all fighting it globally. And I think what he\u2019s trying to say, that therefore makes people think, well, we\u2019re in this fight together. Let\u2019s join resource resources. Let\u2019s get on the same team and fight this thing. And I argue that if we don\u2019t give in to that and don\u2019t give into a global government, the next thing they\u2019re going to up the ante with an alien threat, which will be an extension of COVID right? As far as like a global risk. Quote, many Asian countries reacted quickly because they were prepared logistically and organizationally due to SARS. And thus were able to lessen the impact of the pandemic. Because by the way, like, not all these things come from China not to sound like a jerk, but I mean, I don\u2019t Well, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. I just know that like, a lot of these viruses seem to come from there. Is it because they\u2019re mistreating the animals? Is it because of those, uh, wet markets? Is it because of labs, the wool hand lab quote, by contrast, many Western countries were unprepared and were ravaged by the pandemic. It\u2019s no coincidence that they\u2019re the ones in which the false notion of a black swan event circulated the most. However, we can confidently assert that the pandemic, a high probability, high consequences White Swan event, will provoke many black swan events through second, third and fourth order effects. And he\u2019s saying the Western cultures weren\u2019t able to foresee the impact. And on top of the initial impact, there\u2019s going to be the side effects rippling through all these businesses that we still don\u2019t even know about. We don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening in because it\u2019s very complex system. We\u2019re interconnected globally. In America we don\u2019t manufacture like we used to. Any any refers to this topic is velocity in the book. There\u2019s like a velocity to it, right. Oh, and should you wonder about the white swan Black Swan deal. The Black Swan theory is an idea that there\u2019s some kind of rare, unforeseen event and it comes in and then after the fact people are like, Oh, well, we should have known that was gonna happen. Whereas like, for years, these nerves like Bill Gates had been saying, like, Look, there ran a global pandemic, someday, we need to be ready. I mean, even your boy Obama handed off a folder of like, here\u2019s the in case of pan global pandemic folder that apparently, and I don\u2019t want to get political, but you know, Trump throwing the garbage and dismantle the CDCs global pandemic team. That Hey, that\u2019s just what they\u2019re saying on the news that is, in fact funded by people within the same group. So question everything. Let\u2019s keep reading. What the history of previous epidemics shows again and again, is how pandemics exploit trade routes and the clash that exists between the interests of public health and those of economics, something that constituents Oh, that constitutes an economic aberration, as we will see in just a few pages, as the historian Simon scammer describes, in the midst of calamity economics is always at loggerheads with the interest of public health, even though until there was an understanding of germ borne diseases. The plague was mostly attributed to foul air and noxious vapors said to arise from stagnant or polluted marshes. There was nonetheless a sense that the very commercial arteries that generated prosperity were now transformed into vectors of poison. But when quarantines were proposed, and or imposed, those who stood to lose most merchants, and in some places, artisans, and workers from the stoppage of markets, fares and trade put up stiff resistance, must the economy die, so that it could be resurrected and robust good health? Yes, said the guardians of public health who became part of urban life in Europe as a bloc. Now look, what they\u2019re saying is he said, we\u2019ve done this before dummies, fighting against the quarantine saying all you can\u2019t lock us down. And there\u2019s somewhere in here where he lays out a pretty good argument. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re gonna get into it. Because look, and I\u2019ve got friends who owned businesses that have the same sentiment, like, Look, you can\u2019t just crush the economy because it\u2019s gonna kill a few people. Well, I mean, true, right? To an extent. look old, the Schwab sister says, and I don\u2019t know if I disagree with them, because look at the Meatpacking industry, at the factory farms there. They say his argument is like, Look, you can\u2019t have a full open economy because there\u2019s two reasons. One, there\u2019s a psychological component. The news tells you there\u2019s people dying of this disease. And you know, even though only maybe a percentage of people will be scared, you know, you take 30% of your customers away. That\u2019s a pretty big chunk. So like on one hand, you\u2019re not going to get everyone out there anyway because psychologically They\u2019re not ready to keep the economy fired up. And then on the other hand, if you had everything running at full speed, everyone working as normal, pretend nothing\u2019s wrong, the virus will spread and you\u2019ll have, you know, half your workforce is out sick or one of them\u2019s dead now and blah, blah, blah, and it goes on and on. It ripples around and it makes things worse. That\u2019s the argument. That\u2019s why they say look, just shut it down for two weeks. Even though that didn\u2019t work, right. But this is I mean, this is what they This is what they\u2019re saying. They\u2019re saying merchants, artisans. At the markets and the fair back in the day, they were like, Hell no, you ain\u2019t gonna quarantine me from the Black Death. I got together and make that money. Maybe I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll only live 24 years I got I can\u2019t lock down for four months. It\u2019s like half my life. Let\u2019s keep y\u2019all a seminal paper on the long term economic consequences of major pandemics throughout history shows that significant macro economic after effects can persist as long as 40 years, substantially depressing real rates of return. This is in contrast to wars that have the opposite effect, they destroy capital, while pandemics do not. Wars trigger higher real estate rates, implying greater economic activity, while pandemics trigger lower real estate rates, implying sluggish economic activity. In addition, consumers tend to react to the shock by increasing their savings either because of new precautionary concerns, or simply to replace wealth lost during the epidemic. Bah bah, bah, similar but less extreme examples of other pandemics point to the same conclusion, labor gains in power to the detriment of capital. What he\u2019s saying is assets will decrease, but labor wages will go up. He\u2019s saying that there\u2019s gonna be an effect on the economy for many, many years, again, supporting the idea of a new normal, based on the research of other major pandemics. And it\u2019s like they knew right like Bill Gates and all these guys have been saying they\u2019ve been warning you for a long time about a pandemic, because they apparently are having a foresight to be like, this is gonna create a ripple effect and everyone\u2019s gonna be hating life. Okay, let\u2019s keep reading. And overwhelming consensus has emerged within the global scientific community, that Jin qui one of China\u2019s leading scientists had a right when he said in April 2020, quote, this is very likely to be an epidemic that coexist with humans for a long time, become seasonal and is sustained within human bodies. What does that mean means get ready for more flu shots. Now you taking your flu shot, you\u2019re taking your COVID shot, shots, shots, shots, shots shots. In the second scenario, the first wave is followed by a larger wave that takes place in the third or fourth quarter of 2020. And one or more, one or several similar smaller waves in 2021. Like during the Spanish flu pandemic, this scenario requires the reimplementation of mitigation systems around the fourth quarter of 2020 to contain the spread of infection by block. Okay, so I\u2019m reading my notes are the reason I brought that up, they basically have done simulations that were on the money with exactly how this thing looks. And I guess the point there is like, I don\u2019t think these guys are entirely wrong. I think, like I always say, like, I don\u2019t think these are like all complete dumb asses. I don\u2019t trust them. In fact, maybe that makes them less trustworthy. Can\u2019t trust a smart, evil nerd. Okay, so they keep talking about this is Okay, here we go. Here\u2019s where he talks about why you can\u2019t shut down the economy. The reasons are twofold. One on the supply side, a pre if prematurely loosening the various restrictions and the rules of social distancing resulted in an acceleration of infection, which almost all scientists believe it would, more employees and workers would become infected and more businesses would just stop functioning. As I say, it\u2019s a saving economy and just letting people die. Like that\u2019s the that\u2019s the one option. That\u2019s what was that Governor Abbott in Texas was saying at the beginning, he\u2019s like, Look, man, like people got die. Sorry. Economy is God. And I don\u2019t and look, I get it. I get why you would have that stance. He said, there\u2019s two reasons. One, if everyone went back to work, the businesses will eventually shut down because everyone\u2019s either gonna be sick or dead. And this is what happened. You remember when the meat factories did this and then Trump man Did they have to stay open? But it also happened in sports ball? Yes. Back on November 29, the Denver Broncos had all of their quarterbacks out with COVID all of them. And here\u2019s the thing, aren\u2019t those sports ball teams, all quarantine in hotels and stuff this whole time? Well, the point is, you could try a full reopening. But not only is everyone going to get the COVID and casualties be will be way higher and the hospital will be overwhelmed. But the confidence to go out and spend and party and go to the bars and go on vacations like both the confidence won\u2019t be there because it\u2019s a it\u2019s a conundrum as the deaths and hospitalizations increase. The people paying attention will lose confidence in going out and say that\u2019s scary, I ain\u2019t going out. Not everyone is in the position to endure the the COVID disease or at the very minimum they\u2019re worried about getting someone close to them. It\u2019s a real conundrum. Let\u2019s keep reading individuals perceptions of safety drive consumer and business decisions which means that sustained economic improvement is contingent upon two things, the confidence that the pandemic is behind us without which people will not consume and invest and the proof that the virus is defeated globally. So you see that\u2019s the second reason you can\u2019t save the economy by just sacrificing people to COVID population won\u2019t consume they won\u2019t spend unless they\u2019re save and the viruses bind us and and look I don\u2019t know if I agree with that entirely. Because I\u2019m here to tell you living in Utah through this pandemic health houses and car sales are through the roof through the roof I got a friend who manages a car sales lot biggest selling months ever in the history of the company. I got a friend looking for a house can\u2019t get into one they sell the day they go up on the market now would now here\u2019s an idea I wanted to flow this idea because I like to test the boundaries of our thought process here because I don\u2019t want you to be a sheep a slave to what I say or anyone else critical thinking okay, here\u2019s an exercise with the troopers be so apt to call out the governments if maybe the government was like look the virus is fine there\u2019s no virus everything\u2019s fine. Nobody\u2019s dying. Because guess what the truth is would do then they\u2019d be screaming bloody murder about oh my god they there\u2019s a deadly virus and they just these want us to keep consuming and obeying. Right? Is that what they would do? We always take this sort of devil\u2019s advocate stance with the government and and the authorities. The authorities are like look Hey, there\u2019s a deadly virus coming. We need to be careful because life is gonna die. And then the truth is like hell no, you just did a scan demick What do you want to do you want them to say yeah, no, it\u2019s fine. Everything\u2019s fine. Meanwhile, people are dying left and right hospitals are overflowing they got the ice truck pulling up and you know that there\u2019s a there\u2019s a hospital I have a friend working in auto industry said they\u2019re starting to stack the bodies in the the the trucks that\u2019s not just some news fake news crap I\u2019m seen on the on the TV. So like what the truth is be like oh, my God, you should protect us. You should tell us to wear masks. You should be working on a vaccine but they don\u2019t they want us to die. They want us to just consume and fuel their fuel their their pockets with wealth. Now just a fun exercise thought exercise. I\u2019m not saying I agree with that stance. I\u2019m just saying that would be one that let\u2019s keep reading. If governments fail to save lives, people afraid of the virus will not resume shopping, traveling or dining out this will hinder economic recovery locked down or no lock down. And it\u2019s true, right? I\u2019ve really gone out deep nearly to the extent that I had before. Quote, the simple conclusion in countries afflicted with registered COVID-19 cases that at the peak were roughly doubling every two days. Governments had no reasonable alternative but to impose rigorous lockdowns. Genting otherwise is to ignore the power of exponential growth and the considerable damage it can inflict through a pandemic, because of the extreme velocity of the COVID-19 progression. The timing and forcefulness of the intervention. Were of the essence. Any like any goes on he cites two studies proving the lock bounds save lives. Then, you know, you add in the rate of reinfection and the velocity of COVID he\u2019s saying he\u2019s basically like, Look, this is the only choice. Nobody wanted to lock down. But that\u2019s the way it had to be. That\u2019s what He says, okay, they\u2019ll shoot the messenger. The shock that the pandemic has inflicted on the global economy has been more severe and has occurred much faster than anything else in recorded economic history. Even the Great Depression in the early 1930s, in the global financial crisis in 2008, it took several years for GDP to contract by 10% or more, and for unemployment to soar above 10%. And he\u2019s right again. He\u2019s right. He look at you remember, when back in late 2019, the Georgia community was all up in arms clamoring about all these CEOs stepping down, you remember that? They were dumping their stocks? Me Bill Gates did it do they all did it. And then I think in March, even like a bunch of Congress people, they were dumping their stocks. Because they\u2019re not idiots. They knew it was coming. The assessor the economic economist Kenneth Rogoff, warned, quote, everything depends on how long it lasts. But if this goes on for a long time, it\u2019s certainly going to be the mother of all financial crisis. Consequently, the service sector that represents by far the largest component of economic activity activity in any developed economy, about 70% of GDP, and more than 80% of employment in the US, was hit the hardest by the pandemic. It also suffered from another distinctive characteristic, contrary to manufacturing or agriculture, lost revenues and services are gone forever, they cannot be deferred because service companies don\u2019t hold inventories or stock raw materials. Several months into the pandemic, it looks like even assemblance of a return to business as usual for most service companies, is inconceivable. As long as COVID-19 remains a threat to our health. This in turn suggests that a full return to normal cannot be envisioned envisaged in Hellboy in envisaged before a vaccine is available. This is gonna be bad, right? That\u2019s true. I\u2019m reading Time magazine article about how service industries are the future of America. And that\u2019s kind of not good. So he might be right, like there might be massive deferred issues. If that\u2019s the industry that gets hit the hardest with this kind of thing. And this will fit into the World Economic Forum\u2019s eight point plan of this global communist re proportioning of stuff if too many people are without, well, what happens is you got too many poor people and too many desperate people, and then you got increased crime and it comes peer anarchie. The next hurdle is the political challenge of vaccinating enough people worldwide, we are as collectively as strong as the weakest link with a high enough compliance rate, despite the rise of anti vaxxer Oh, so there he goes, uh, you know, and that\u2019s the writing\u2019s on the wall, they\u2019re going to force that thing. In the US a harbinger of difficulties to come elsewhere, it is estimated that the official rate of unemployment could reach a peak of 25% in 2020, a level equivalent to that of the Great Depression. That would be even higher, if hidden unemployment were to be taken into account, like workers or the law, situation of employees in the service industry will be particularly dire. So if you are going to serve as injuries, nobody\u2019s saying get out now. services are like people that do tasks versus selling a product. You have to ask an economist, I don\u2019t really understand how this would affect someone like an attorney or whatever, who does a service or YouTuber, I don\u2019t know. Do a little homework on that. Two reasons account for this striking difference. One, the US labor market has higher and fire culture that doesn\u2019t exist and is often prohibited by law in Europe. And to right from the onset of the crisis Europe put into place fiscal measures is just destined to support employment. And he\u2019s saying that and and if you look it up, the US unemployment went up 11%, Germany went up 1%. Because immediately Germany was putting in measures to protect the workers in America, we don\u2019t really do that. We don\u2019t really do that. The substance of the argument goes like this automation is disruptive, but it improves productivity and increases wealth, which in turn leads to greater demand for goods and services, and dust new types of jobs to satisfy those demands. And that is a section where he talks about how automation will be part of this new normal. And he\u2019s saying the robots are good for them. The economy is Alex Jones wrong. Alex Jones talk about the robots replacing everybody. That\u2019s not what old trumpster says. In the pre pandemic era, new AI based technologies were gradually introduced to automate some of the tasks performed by humans. COVID-19 crisis in its accompanying measures of social distancing, has suddenly accelerated the innovation. chat bots, voice recognition software like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and other software can replace tasks normally performed by humans. He says the labor market will become polarized between highly paid work and lots of jobs that have disappeared or aren\u2019t well paying. Now let\u2019s see what else he says here. I got a lot on notes. I\u2019m gonna I\u2019m gonna I\u2019m gonna cut back on my readings and give you the notes. Oh, dear, dogs are losing. So he basically lays out an idea that the great reset on values will happen because previous to the COVID GDP was the big factor, right? The big metric everyone measure progress on? Well, GDP doesn\u2019t account for the well being of the average person. This is a very communist socialist sort of idea. And New Zealand has already got a metric tracking mental health. And America you know, in America, we\u2019ve notoriously have shit mental health. With the mass shootings, the depression, the suicides, there\u2019s a stigma against therapy. I mean, we\u2019re pretty weird country rap. Like, what do they say about like, as far as sexy? Were Puritans in the streets of freaks in the sheets? Okay. He lays out this idea that happiness depends on more than like, material wealth and these sorts of things. And I mean, this is written by a bunch of rich guys so make sense? Right? I think they\u2019re just trying to sell sell you on this idea. But I mean, he\u2019s not wrong entirely, right? He\u2019s saying that we\u2019re going to place more value on the environment responsible eating, empathy, generosity, and all these things, which are all great ideas, right? I\u2019m not opposed to that. He says the green economy spans a range of possibilities from greener energy to ecotourism to the circular economy. For example, shifting from the take, make dispose approach to production and consumption to a model that is restorative and regenerative by design. To preserve resources, minimize waste, use a product before reaches the end, user or use a product again before it reaches the end of his life, creating further value that can generate economic benefits with job growth and all this stuff. Says companies have strategies that favor repairable products with longer lifespans from phones cars fashion that even offer free repairs, like Patagonia and platform platforms with trading products are expanding fast. I love this idea, right? This sounds great. I hate buying new products I reuse and repair as long as I possibly can. I Lowe\u2019s shopping for new stuff. I load products that last five years and fill up a landfill like you know, ovens and washers and dryers. I\u2019ve always had like Doug just charged me twice as much I don\u2019t care make this thing last longer. I had a I had a Kodak printer. It was a great printer. And they stopped making them print cartridges and I email so what the hell, why aren\u2019t you making the ink cartridges anymore? And I always stopped supporting that model. I\u2019m like, this is the best printer I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve had this thing like 10 years. And they\u2019re like That\u2019s nice. glad you enjoyed it. God that about a son of a gun so to go buy another printer. Yeah, I hate the I hate consuming and throwing crap in Atlanta Phil when there\u2019s no need for it. That\u2019s why I hate no one else I hate. You don\u2019t really grinds my gears prelit Christmas trees. Because then the lights go out. And you got to throw this giant Christmas tree in the garbage. just sell the things without the lights and put them on or make a lights that you can fix easier. Alright, so like me in class, we agree on that one. We have five on that one. Okay. Oh, let\u2019s see. He\u2019s talking about growth. There\u2019s gonna be growth. I\u2019ll give you the short version growth opportunities in health and education. Do then there\u2019s a C, there\u2019s a D growth movement, embracing zero or negative GDP growth. If you believe that he\u2019s saying that there\u2019s a certain stigma behind being consumers. They don\u2019t like that. Some people don\u2019t like that. Like the some people appreciate advocating for eating less meat. Taking fewer flights and all that stuff. It says the pandemic has spurred renewed interest in this movement that wants to reverse the pace of economic growth. Leading more than 1100 experts from around the world to release a manifesto in May 20 2020. For the D growth strategy to tackle economic and human crisis caused by COVID-19. They\u2019d ended up with all the granola things, right? Do all the good things. And this is where you start getting a taste of the the say when they say you\u2019ll, you\u2019ll make less, you\u2019ll have less, you\u2019ll be happier. None of I buy into that. I mean, it definitely goes in the face of the red blooded, capitalist free market capitalism and hoarding. But I got lots of questions on that as a bigger show. How are you going to get the elites to support this? Are they going to just buy into this? Are they going to force us to live on this standard of equitable wealth while they maintain their yachts and private jets? I mean, that\u2019s the backbone of socialism, right? See, boop, boop boop for you. Oh, here\u2019s Here we go. Listen to the disdain for America Klaus Schwab has. For decades, the US has enjoyed the exorbitant privilege of retaining the global currency reserve status that has long been a perk of Imperial might and economic lyxor elixir. To a considerable extent, American power and prosperity has been built and reinforced by the global trust in the dollar, and the willingness of customers abroad to hold it most often in the form of US government bonds. The fact that so many countries have foreign institutions want to hold dollars as a store of Reserve has anchored its status. This has enabled the US to borrow cheaply abroad and benefit from low interest rates at home, which in turn has allowed Americans to consume beyond their means. Consume beyond our means say this will support the argument that we\u2019re going to put forth in the future episodes. America must crumble to her greedy knees. That\u2019s their viewpoint. And I look I don\u2019t know, are they right? I don\u2019t know. America is kind of a wacky place. I don\u2019t have the kind of worldview to know like, Oh, you know, people in Germany are much better people and happier. I don\u2019t know, I have no idea. I\u2019m already swimming in the fish tank. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like outside. In Plato\u2019s proverbial cave, as it were. Here we go for quite some time, some analysts and policymakers have been considering a possible and progressive end to the dominance of the dollar. They now think the pandemic might be the catalyst that proves them right. On the one hand, managing the economy, doubters of the US dollar dominance, pointed the inevitable and sharp deterioration of the US fiscal position in their mind unsustainable levels of debt, and eventually erode confidence competence in the US dollar says prior to the pandemic, US defense spending in interest, entitlements represented 112% of the federal tax receipts versus 95%. Back in 2017. I Wonder Boy Obama was in you know, they always say the liberals want to spend but it\u2019s, it\u2019s both both camps. The unsustainable path will worsen in post pandemic post bailout era, this argument suggests that something major will therefore have to change and this is where, look, I\u2019m no economist. But he\u2019s saying we\u2019re not collecting enough taxes. Obama had a balance down to reduce the debt with a 97 or 95%. Trump come in and cut the taxes without cutting expenditures, like you want to do the tax cuts fine. But now you got to cut expenditures. And the US dollar apparently is not in good shape because of that. And the pandemic will make it worse. I mean, you see what they\u2019re doing when the stimulus bills are handing out money to keep things moving, there\u2019s gonna be a price to pay for that. And he says people have been looking to knock down the dollar as a global standard, because of all this stuff. And later, he he says that we we as a country are punishing other countries with economic sanctions, which he implies is pretty immature. And not again, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not an economist. I don\u2019t know how this works. This is what I read from this book. He says, As for a global virtual currency, there\u2019s not in sight yet. But there are attempts to launch national digital currencies that may eventually dethrone the US dollar supremacy. Then there you go. He\u2019s talking and then he talks about China and the euro. Those things can overtake the dollar. But digital man maybe he says China\u2019s pushing a digital currency that worked in an effort to detach itself from the US dollar and I think he\u2019s saying that digital currencies a way for them to do this? This is the crypto currencies This is the Bitcoin because again, the US dollar is a fiat currency, it depends on the perception as to how much it\u2019s really worth. So again, this guy isn\u2019t necessarily wrong. And it\u2019s it\u2019s funny because the truth is are out there supporting the kryptos and the bitcoins? Well, they\u2019re supporting the detachment from the US dollar, because they think, well, it\u2019s the Federal Reserve, and they\u2019re the evil ones. Well, what about Klaus Schwab over here, he\u2019s saying, like, we need to crush the US dollar. Lots of questions to be brought up from this sort of thinking. Oh, let\u2019s see. And then I guess Kissinger was saying that like nations flourish on the belief that their governments can foresee calamity but now that COVID-19 distress will be levels higher than ever which is true everyone\u2019s into conspiracies. Truth there\u2019s where the new rock stars right? Everyone\u2019s looking to the truth there\u2019s to find the truth. My dumb but my, my alien book. Use Your Illusion one hit number one on the UFO category above big hitters real, real big names in the you ufologists community. Thank you, by the way, for reading and reviewing the books. It\u2019s a big to do this year has been crazy. I could tell you, I\u2019ve had all kinds of people approaching me that I\u2019d never had before. Now, let\u2019s keep reading says okay basically says a country\u2019s a handled pandemic. Well, we\u2019re the ones that trusted their leaders and cared for the common good over the individual. So he\u2019s saying, you know, this selfish? Me I\u2019m out to get mine attitude isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. He says that neoliberal Neo liberalism is defined as in his definition as free market capitalism, which is confusing to me. But that\u2019s what neoliberalism is. He says we\u2019ll have a rich redistribution of wealth. And later he tells you because COVID exacerbates the wealth status, the poor became poor, the rich became richer, which was true, right? You saw about how Elan musk and Bezos all made all this money this year. But he says that cannot be sustained. We will need social welfare programs to redistribute wealth to the poor. Any any makes a decent point wealthier people are, you know their home telework and being safe, but the lower income people they had to get out there the essential workers get up there in the in the restaurant, the food factory in the grocery store, you take on the risk and your well being. He\u2019s saying this is something that will need to be reckoned. He talks about African Americans getting hit harder by COVID because of all those reasons we\u2019ve discussed including poor nutrition. Let\u2019s keep reading and see and and this is I\u2019m going to take a minute a soapbox minute here and let\u2019s read is what he says we value least economically the individual society needs the most sobering truth is that the heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, those who at personal risk, took care of the sick kept the economy ticking are among the worst paid professionals, the nurses, the cleaners, the delivery drivers, the workers in food factories, care homes and warehouses among others. It is often their contribution to economic and societal welfare that is the least recognized and I agree with them again another high five for me in the swamps to hear because a lot of people they they crap on servers and restaurants, fast food workers. Like Like all they\u2019re just simple to just make me my burger idiot. Like, these are human beings like I hear it all the time. People dangling this 20% tip over their servers, not not seeing that they\u2019re busy or whatever. And you know, he asserts that on top of not making enough money to live these people on top of that are working these higher stress higher anxiety jobs because they\u2019re always one bad move from being fired. And being completely screwed. That\u2019s I thought I appreciated that statement he was making I agree with him. Let\u2019s talk about these dumb dogs are barking all day. That\u2019s what I get. You know, I we rescued the shelter dogs and they got bad manners. I don\u2019t know what to do. Okay, this is this dog\u2019s been abused his whole life. She\u2019s She\u2019s rude. I\u2019m sorry. I apologize. Let\u2019s see what else what else what else what else. Um, he compares a hedge fund manager making millions. I\u2019ll put in the economy at danger. Well, like the 2008 housing crisis, he bumps that idea up against a nurse, a nurse other risking their lives, to protect people for low wages. And he says that societal unrest will push to equalize this, that will happen, he says, says poor people are now poor. And what happens when there\u2019s nothing when there\u2019s nothing left you commit crimes. And your options now are increased lawn order that gives you your military police state or your social welfare state. That\u2019s again, playing into this whole idea that there\u2019s a new normal things are going to change. He is predicting the future, we\u2019ll see if he\u2019s right. old, old Santa Claus Schwab here, Santa Claus. He says that he lays out an argument. I\u2019ll read, you know, I\u2019ll make I\u2019ll decipher this for you. And it talks about the Cold War. He said governments and capitalist countries were so worried by an internal communist rebellion that they put into place a state led model to forestall it, the system in which state bureaucrats managed large chunks of the economy ranging from transportation to energy stayed in place well into the 1970s. What he\u2019s saying, and I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s wrong, is that we\u2019re already in some kind of quasi communist type of economy. And that big traumas like wars, will or pandemics, they will roll out more social programs. The Great Depression gateway to social programs from cradle to grave with the New Deal, the Cold War threaten the the full blown communist takeover the economy, so the government beat them to it. With state led management of the private sector, that\u2019s your department of transportation and all that stuff. So in some ways, he\u2019s saying we\u2019re already there, it\u2019s, this is just going to tip the scales a little bit more. He lays out how we\u2019ve already had this massive dose of socialism to prevent these meltdowns. Yeah, that was the financial crisis with the, you know, the too big to fail stuff. And then the stimulus with the COVID-19 thing. And he argues that the reason the great reset will happen, because, inevitably, with all this calamity, the government must take a larger role in the social issues. Because of all the, you know, exacerbation of things that the pandemic causes. He\u2019s telling you big governments coming in, he wants you in the big global government. But maybe they\u2019ll settle for something a little bit less than that. He said, we went through this high trauma event. And now we have to manage that risk better. Because you know, what\u2019s going to happen now that we see the okay global pandemics can happen? Well, that\u2019s going to increase the bureaucracy, it\u2019s going to increase the groups that monitor this stuff and the response and all that. And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s bad. Now, what\u2019s reassuring, is that I\u2019m gonna read you from this. This is a little bit of reassurance. He says inevitably, and understandably, a good social contract for China will be different from one for the US, which in turn will not resemble that of Sweden or Nigeria. However, there could all share some common features and principles to a particular standout, a broader if not universal provision of social assistance, social insurance, health care, basic quality services, to a move towards enhanced protection for workers and those currently most vulnerable, like those employed in the gig economy. So I mean, that\u2019s reassuring to know that like, they don\u2019t want those glow. I mean, they want a global umbrella, but they know that we\u2019re all gonna do this under different timelines says countries that perceived at providing subpar response to the pandemic, many citizens will start asking critical questions such as why in the midst of the pandemic, my country lacked mask respirators and ventilators. Why weren\u2019t we prepared? Bah bah, bah. And then it talks about how COVID revealed gaps in the most welfare systems. At first glance, the nations that reacted the most inclusively were those with elaborate welfare systems, most notably the Scandinavian countries. To provide an example as early as March 2020, Norway guaranteed 80% of cellphones. employed workers average incomes based on the tax returns of the previous three years, while Denmark guaranteed 75%. At the other end of the spectrum, the market oriented economies played catch up and showed in decisiveness and how to protect the most vulnerable segments of the labor market. So on a song, because, you know, they have that people always point to the like, Oh, look at Sweden, they they didn\u2019t shut anything down. They just went for herd immunity. Well, they also had a bit of socialism over there. So like, it\u2019s not apples to apples, right? The guaranteed incomes over there. Okay, you can have a full open thing, but like, will pay to stay home and I bet a lot of people stay at home. Right? I don\u2019t know. Um, let\u2019s see. What else do you got among the rich countries only the US has a system that leaves it at the discretion of employers to decide whether to provide paid sick leave. In 2019. almost a quarter of all US workers did not benefit from it. In March 2020, when the pandemic started to rage in the US, President Trump signed into law new legislation, the temporary temporarily required employers to provide two weeks of sick leave, plus family leave at partial pay, but only for workers with childcare problems, excuse me. Two things here. sick leave in America is again part of our weird work mentality that I\u2019m not saying hey, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong. And you\u2019re talking to a guy who\u2019s held a steady job since I was 13. So don\u2019t take this as some softy weak thing. I\u2019m just saying that in America like we shame people for not coming into work sick. Isn\u2019t that stupid? That if somehow if you\u2019re sick and or you don\u2019t feel good, and you stay home, that somehow you\u2019re not committed to the job. When To me, that\u2019s always been the rudest thing ever. When people show up sick, I\u2019m like, go the hell home. What are you doing? And they\u2019re all me who\u2019s gonna sack up and come into work? Like, no, you\u2019re an asshole. You\u2019re not thinking of anyone else. You\u2019re gonna make us sick. We all got to deal with your poor decision. Stay home with you. I know. You don\u2019t want to hang out with your kids stay home with them. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want your virus. Give it to your kids. Oh, and to another point, Trump pushed us down the path of socialism, if you want to be technical about it, because this is part of the great reset, giving sick leave to people. Yeah, what about that? What do we think about that? Now, let\u2019s keep reading. This is all made more significant by the fact that the younger generation is likely to be more radical than the older one in refashioning the social contract, the pandemic has upended their lives and a whole generation across the globe will be defined by economic and social insecurity. With millions dude enter the workforce in the midst of a profound recession, they will bear the scars forever. Also, starting off in a deficit, many students have educational debts, likely to have long term effects. Already the millennials, at least in the Western world are worse off than their parents in terms of earnings, assets and wealth, they\u2019re less likely to own a home or have children than their parents were. Now another generation Gen Z is entering a system that sees that it sees as failing and that will be be set by long standing problems revealed. And this is another big thing, right? Another big topic. You got these boomers out there living their best lives down in Key West on their jazziz You know, they\u2019re doing it. Well. They didn\u2019t have to do as much college. They retired at a reasonable age with a pension. And, you know, I look I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m like on a cusp of Gen X and millennial and Gen X technically. But, you know, I got a master\u2019s degree $50,000 in school debt. And I\u2019m working literally, I literally took the position of a woman with no degree whatsoever. She retired and I got to take her on her spot. I was like, Oh, that\u2019s cool. You know, it\u2019s, uh, and you know, these jobs. They don\u2019t offer pensions anymore. They offer 401 K\u2019s. So I agree with old Santa Claus here, Santa Claus. Same with the housing crisis. I lost 1000s and 1000s of dollars in the housing crisis. We bought our first home and then everything tanked. I mean, if you had to quantify it, I would say maybe 80 grand and the problem is that Housing is one of the the best and only methods that a lot of people in the lower class have to move up. Right? And why did that happen? Well, it collapsed because a wall street greed, they\u2019re messed around trying to regulate, you know, the are trying to sell off, what do you call it dividends or whatever, not dividends, you know what I\u2019m saying my brains get mushy towards the end of the show here. But they, they actually had laws to regulate this free market, but those got lifted out. And now we all get to deal with the the, with the nonsense that ensued. Good times. So he\u2019s saying like, on one hand, the younger generations, they don\u2019t expect to have these things, and they don\u2019t even care. And it\u2019s true, like, they don\u2019t even want a house, they\u2019re like, I don\u2019t want to deal with it, give me an apartment, I don\u2019t care. And that\u2019ll fit nicely in with the World Economic Forum\u2019s plan for everyone. Here, he calls out social media as a catalyst for change. And it you know, to me, it\u2019s arguable that it can be manipulated by corporations or special interest groups, as you saw on that Netflix show. This was called the social dilemma. So that\u2019s a concern for me. He\u2019s a he says social media is the big catalyst for change. And he\u2019s right, that\u2019s where people go. But you\u2019ve got a lot of fingers in that pie. He talks about global trade. And it\u2019s kind of boring. See, the rise of nationalism makes retreat of globalization inevitable and most of the world an impulse particularly notable in the West, the vote for Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, on a protectionist platform are two momentous markers of the Western backlash against globalization. And then, previously, he said that the pandemic will definitely cause a retreat from globalization. He said that the Brexit and Trump showed the western world\u2019s denial of globalism. And it\u2019s either he\u2019s saying we\u2019re not actually going towards globalism, which, you know, to me is like, well, that\u2019s a good thing, right? Like he thinks is a bad thing. But like, as far as like, the truth is goes like, that\u2019s a good thing. Right? Like, if, if Santa Claus is saying, We\u2019re retreating from globalism, then I guess that\u2019s good, but they are trying to figure out a way to pull us back in No, you think you\u2019re out and they\u2019re gonna pull you back in with aliens or COVID, or whatever. And he talks about how you can do this, or you can de globalize, it\u2019s going to take a huge investment of money to shorten the supply chain. And COVID made this more enticing, right? Because now, it\u2019s worth all that money to restart the manufacturing in America. Remember the masks, we couldn\u2019t get mask. So in some ways, COVID helped America break out of this globalization scheme. If you want to put a you know, if you wanna make lemonade out of this a little bit. And here\u2019s one you\u2019re gonna love, because he defines global governance. Okay. So this global governance is commonly defined as the process of cooperation among transmit transnational actors aimed at providing responses to global problems, those that affect more than one state or region. It encompasses the totality of institutions policies, norms, procedures, and initiative, through which nation states try to bring more predictability and stability to their responses to transnational challenges. Then he says, sadly, we\u2019re in talks about the problems so sadly, we\u2019re now at this critical juncture put bluntly, we live in a world in which nobody is really in charge. Like if you dude, want control who wants that? But like, you got to understand the mindset of these folks, these globalist You know, they\u2019re a big hammer and every every country\u2019s a nail, and they just want to consolidate and control and they think they have noble reasons for doing it. Like I said, I think, I think they buy into the population control idea, and climate change, and they say, look, these idiots are gonna, they\u2019re out of control. And we\u2019re gonna go extinct, if the masses have it their way. He\u2019s not entirely wrong. But he says, code would have been handled better if we had a global government watching over and coordinating. I mean, is he right? Okay, the World Health Organization. That tedros guy, some was he\u2019s like some Ethiopian terrorist or something in bed with China, who told you back in January, he\u2019s like, Oh, no, there\u2019s no human to human transmission of the Wu Han flew, everything\u2019s fine because the allegedly China\u2019s paying them off to say that. And the fact is, is they knew back then what it was. So like, do we really trust that I don\u2019t I don\u2019t, then let\u2019s see. Oh, yeah. And then another. You remember When, when, you know, and look, I\u2019m not saying centralizing power is terrible. So like back when Trump was like, you know, each state is going to manage their own COVID situation federal government\u2019s not getting involved. And the state governments, they were freaking out, they were trying to outbid each other for ventilators and PB on eBay, driving the prices way up. So sometimes you do need the adult in the room, right? I\u2019m not saying like this is a one an either or argument, okay. And in fact, he defends old Santa Claus defends the World Health Organization says they\u2019re underfunded. They collect info on a voluntary basis. There\u2019s no mandate to, you know, send information through the the who. But there\u2019s a lot of weird things with who that\u2019s another show on its own right. Let\u2019s see, I wrote a note here. Let\u2019s say let me read. They will also agree with Winston Churchill who once observed that the US has an innate capability to learn from its mistakes, when he remarked that the US always did the right thing when all the alternatives have been exhausted. Old wisdom Churchill\u2019s funny, right. He lays out an interesting article, because he\u2019s trying to defend the idea of global governance, with global issues like climate change, and environment and all that stuff. And he talks about zoonotic diseases that spread from animals to humans. He says that most experts and conservationists agree that they have drastically increased in recent years because of deforestation, a phenomenon also linked to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. And he says that basically makes, you know, take out the animal\u2019s habitat, and now they\u2019re encroaching upon human civilization. And this is an interesting idea, because that\u2019s what you see at the end of contagion. I know if you listen to my contagion film analysis I did back in was April May, like a real psychopath in the midst of a scary pandemic unleash. But at the end of the film, you see the bat that started the whole thing. He he flies away from his habitat, because they\u2019re, they\u2019re busting down the forest to you know, get palm oil for the Orioles or whatever. But he makes a good point here, you you destroy the animal\u2019s habitat, it\u2019s a twofer. You have more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And now the animals encroach upon civilizations sharing their viruses that we there\u2019s billions, apparently like millions of viruses out there in the wild that we don\u2019t even know about. And we\u2019re basically forcing them upon us. The bubble bowl, they talk about the land use, Okay, here we go. Since 1970, land use changes have had the largest relative negative impact on nature. And in the process caused a quarter of manmade emissions. Agriculture alone covers more than one third of the terrestrial land surface, and is the economic activity that disrupts nature the most. So what\u2019s he saying? Well, and I\u2019ll start investing in the plant based meat. I mean, this is a good argument for how the population growth, you know, it\u2019s exponential, and you can\u2019t support feeding meat to them. And if people not humanely treated appropriately raised meat. At best, you might be able to support this with factory farms, but that\u2019s not healthy for the cows. They got, you know, these cows, they got like three stomachs and they pump them full of corn. And their stomachs are made to digest grass, not corn. So they abscess and they get infected. And instead of like, saying, oh, maybe we shouldn\u2019t feed them corn. They feed them antibiotics. The problem with full antibiotics to keep them alive. No, it\u2019s true. So yeah, support some of what old Santa Clauses saying over here. Here\u2019s another shining light at the end of the tunnel for you. Because you\u2019re being scared of all this great reset talk. He says some of the old habits will certainly return the joy and pleasure of personal contacts can\u2019t be matched. We are social animals. After all, many of the tech behaviors that were We were forced to adopt during confinement will be more familiar. You know, good to know. He understands that and he\u2019s not one of these. I mean, some people want to portray these globalists as like embracing this virtual reality. Let\u2019s not talk to each other face to face ever again. Thing Even though he does cause animals like a Satanist would, let\u2019s see. And then he says successful contact tracing proved to be a key component of a successful strategy against COVID lockdowns are effective at reducing the reproduction rate of the virus, they don\u2019t eliminate the threat posed by the pandemic. And again, this is the your trading safety for privacy. Right? The contact tracing tool, the way I look at this is they\u2019ve got a multi faceted approach, how can they keep the deaths down of COVID? Well, to keep the deaths down, it\u2019s directly proportionally ratioed to the number of cases, right? So in effect, how do you keep the cases down? Well, you can lock everybody in their home, that\u2019ll do it. You could give everyone a vaccine to make the antibodies so that it doesn\u2019t affect them and they don\u2019t get sick. You could put a mask on them to reduce the risk of transmission. If that works, if that works. But like to me, I\u2019m like, that\u2019s why I\u2019m always like team mask, because I\u2019m like, Look, if this works a little bit, I\u2019ll do it. Because I don\u2019t want the stabby I don\u2019t want the contact tracing. I don\u2019t want none of that. I don\u2019t want to lock downs. I want to keep the economy fired up maybe as much as possible. Not I just don\u2019t know why. That\u2019s such an insane, controversial statement. I got so much hate for that. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Let\u2019s see here. Oh, listen to this. Get this. From the outset. China, Hong Kong and South Korea implemented coercive and intrusive measures of digital tracing. They took the decision to track individuals without their consent through their mobile and credit card data and even employed video surveillance in South Korea. In additional, some economies required mandatory wearing of electronic bracelets to alert those individuals susceptible being affected, blah, blah. See, like, That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Like the some of those countries did really well, they kept their numbers down really well. But that\u2019s a level of intrusion that I think is a bit overboard, myself. And again, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like, Okay, I\u2019ll do the math, like, I\u2019ll meet you guys halfway. But don\u2019t be putting a bracelet on me and tracking my phone, you know, they\u2019re already tracking on your phone, you already know they\u2019re doing that, right. And he goes through a whole section on surveillance. And like, he\u2019s actually fairly level headed with this. He kind of points out the pros and cons. And the idea that like, there\u2019s a certain level of dystopian surveillance that people won\u2019t like. I don\u2019t know he, he fairly cites the drawbacks of surveillance, but he sort of concludes it\u2019s worth it. Right. So like, it\u2019s, it\u2019s nefariously. Put, it\u2019s bad. Like, he\u2019s like, well, it\u2019s kind of bad, but it\u2019s worth it. So like, on one hand, at least, he\u2019s like, not trying to like, pull the wool over your eyes and be like, no, it\u2019s great. You\u2019re gonna love it. Look how great this is. So on some levels, I appreciate the candid honesty there. But I don\u2019t like it overall. He talks about a stake this thing called ESG. Right. It\u2019s your environmental, social and governance score. And this is a you heard you heard about the Chinese social credit system, right. I was like it was that meme. You heard of Elf on the Shelf? Well, what about he, he has g it\u2019s a it\u2019s a social score. But for companies. That\u2019s where this is going to start out. They\u2019re going to start out with a social score for companies that I worry is a slippery slope to every individual having their community score. Good intended ideas. takes us down the wrong path, though. And any rightfully points out that like some of the corporations did some naughty things. He says businesses will be judged for years to come by their actions critically, not just in a narrow commercial sense, but through a broader social lens. Few will forget for example, it over the past 10 years us airlines spent 96% of their cash flow on share buybacks and that in March 2020, EasyJet paid 174 million pounds out to its shareholders. And I looked it up. Yeah, that\u2019s true. Here\u2019s a Forbes article I\u2019m going to read you from Not everything can be blamed on the virus. COVID-19 may have been the last straw but Boeing made some poor decisions including CEO turnover. accusations of mis selling at 737 Mac\u2019s jets, faulty software and spending over $11 billion to buy stock back. And, you know, the buybacks, those were illegal until your boy Reagan till the occultist Reagan showed up in the 80s. Because I had to look that up too. I didn\u2019t know what that meant Exactly. I\u2019ve heard the term I didn\u2019t really know what it meant. It kind of is what it sounds like. companies, they buy their own stock to make the stock price go back up. And they save money because now they\u2019re not paying dividends to the shareholders. Okay. Here\u2019s some more fodder for the idea that things will never be the same. In France in the UK, several industry voices estimate that up to 75% of independent restaurants might not survive the lockdowns, the large chains of fast food giants will this gray write. This in turn suggest that big businesses will get bigger while the smallest will shrink or disappear. A large restaurant chain, for example, has a better chance of staying operational as it benefits for more resources and less competition in the wave of bankruptcies of smaller outfits. Small restaurants that survived the crisis will have to reinvent themselves entirely. In the meantime, in those cases of those have closed the doors forever. The closure will impact not only the restaurant and its immediate staff, but also all the businesses that operate in the orbit the suppliers, the farmers, the truck drivers. So again, he\u2019s talking about your your primary effect, your secondary, your tertiary effects is ripple effect. This is going to play a part on if you noticed, anytime you like buy something, it takes a lot longer customer services a lot longer now. Because of all these ripple effects, there\u2019s no point there\u2019s you\u2019ll hear a lot of truth there\u2019s talk about how how Santa Claus wants you to not fly as much. You\u2019ll hear that a lot. And here\u2019s where the expert I believe they\u2019re referring to. If many businesses decide to travel less to reduce costs, and to replace physical meetings by virtual ones whenever possible, the impact on the recovery and profitability of airlines may be dramatic and lasting. Prior to the pandemic corporate travel accounted for 30% of airline volume, but 50% of revenues, thanks to the higher price seats and last minute bookings. In the future, this is set to change, making the profitability outcome of some individual airlines highly uncertain, and forcing the entire industry to reconsider the long term structure of the global aviation market. So that\u2019s that\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. Like we\u2019re gonna fly last because like there\u2019s a huge impact on the airlines because of this. Same boom, three industries that entirely depend on the aviation sector, airports, infrastructure and retail planes, aerospace and car rentals. So I think he\u2019s saying like the ripple effect of all this is what\u2019s going to make you fly less, because the prices are going to go up. Here\u2019s some more ripple effects. He says, it could also be the case that less money will be spent in restaurants suggesting that in places where a high percentage of people\u2019s food budget traditionally went to restaurants 60% in New York City, for example, these funds could be diverted to end benefit urban supermarkets as city dwellers rediscover the pleasure of cooking at home. And like the section is talking about people you know, doing it yourself, do you like to do it yourself? During the shutdown, he talks about how people are doing it yourself with baking bread and cutting hair and making food and buy online. And this will ripple into people buying more groceries online and smaller grocery stores. Also, damn do people in the big city really spend 60% of their food budget at restaurants. That\u2019s crazy to me. I mean, I guess that makes sense. You don\u2019t want to lug Costco sized grocery stuff in your little shoebox apartment. But damn, how do you not get fat eating out that much? Right. Then he talks a little bit about the digital revolution, which we\u2019re going to get into on the next show where we\u2019re going to go through another one of Santa Clauses books called the the fourth industrial revolution. That\u2019s where we\u2019re getting into more of the transhuman elements. And he kind of he glosses over it a little bit in this book. No need to get into it right now though. There\u2019s more fodder for the idea that things will won\u2019t be the same again. He says the micro reset will force every company in every industry to experiment new ways of doing business working in operating. Those tempted to revert to the old way of doing things will fail. Those that adapt with agility and imagination will eventually turn COVID-19 crisis into their advantage. And what he\u2019s saying is like this was a huge like an overnight shock. To the system. I mean, overnight. It forced every person, every business to find a way to incorporate digital internet technology into their life. overnight. It\u2019s like someone snapped a finger. And now you know you grandma\u2019s Watson Pornhub She didn\u2019t even know how to work an iPhone nine months ago. Now she\u2019s out of control. But no, that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying is like, this is the great reset. It\u2019s true like it forced a lot of people to play catch up real quick. They talks about the psychological impacts of this whole thing which you\u2019ve heard about. Says psychologists tell us that cognitive closure often calls for black and white thinking and simplistic solutions. A terrain pretty boy, why God made me look stupid Santa Claus propitious for conspiracy. Okay, let me restart this. Psychological psychologists tell us that cognitive closure often calls for black and white thinking and simple solutions, a terrain for conspiracy theories and the propagation of rumors, fake news mistruths, another pernicious ideas. In such a context, we look for leadership authority, clarity, meaning the question as to whom do we trust is critical in consequence, so too, does the countervailing issue of whom we distrust or what he\u2019s saying during stress, people want certainty. They want some cognitive closure. They want black and white answers. They want to know is COVID good for you? Is COVID bad for you? Is COVID real is COVID. Fake? They look to people for answers. Like the truth. There\u2019s like Dr. Andrew Kaufman, who assured you this was fake. So you could be like, yeah, COVID fake, it\u2019s not real. This is why people are doubling down. And that\u2019s a dangerous thing to do when you just double down and don\u2019t look at any more evidence. They\u2019re committed to it. They don\u2019t like the gray area, they need that closure. And this is how you get taken advantage of. They found any conspiracy theory to support the reassurance Oh, it\u2019s a liberal hoax all its going away in Easter all it\u2019s going away in spring all it\u2019s gone away and summer. I mean, there\u2019s people who refused to believe that Trump could lose the election. There\u2019s people who refuse to believe in the virus. Because they\u2019re mentally committed to a version of reality, their thoughts become beliefs become reality. But the problem is that reality doesn\u2019t clash with the consensus reality sometimes. Right? You can become too attached to an idea sometimes. Sometimes your filters are a little off. Trust me, I know myself. My filters are off many times, but you got to pivot, you got to be agile. Now, he claims that during this time, a lot of people are doing a lot of reflecting on what\u2019s important in their life. We\u2019ve been pondering utilitarian values our lives, our human lives worth the exchange for money, the economy, the way things always were normal, normal normalcy. He talks about in the book, right? And he says as we said earlier, almost all economists have debunked the myth that sacrificing a few lives will save the economy. But irrespective of those of these experts judgment, the debate and arguments went on in the US in particular, but not exclusively. Some policymakers took the line that it was justifiable to value the economy over life endorsing a policy choice that would have been unimaginable in Asia or Europe, or such pronouncements would have been tantamount to committing political suicide. This realization probably explains UK minister Johnson\u2019s hasty retreat from an initial policy advocating herd immunity, often portrayed by experts and the media as an example of social Darwinism. Isn\u2019t that one of the big evils we talked about? Social Darwinism is not like a Hitler thing eugenics thing like well, you just let the week die. That\u2019s what you do. You let him die and you keep the economy fired up, baby. But you know, Dr. Evil here, all the Santa Claus. See, he tells you that\u2019s not the way to be. It won\u2019t be that simple. And I know what you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re thinking but Isaac, locking people down a bad economy, all these things that\u2019s going to kill people too. Well, guess what? Your boy shadow clouds. He knows that. And he wrote about it right here and I\u2019m going to read it. To the argument put forward by some groups, like americans for prosperity is that recessions kill people. This well, undoubtedly true is a fact that is itself rooted in policy choices informed by ethical considerations. In the US recessions do indeed kill a lot of people, because the absence or limited nature of any social safety net, makes them life threatening how, when people lose their jobs with no state support, and no health insurance, they tend to die of despair through suicides, drug overdoses, alcoholism. Economic recessions also provoked deaths outside of the US policy choices in terms of health insurance, and worker protection can ensure that there are considerably fewer. This is ultimately a moral choice about whether to prioritize the qualities of individualism, or those that favor the destiny of the community. And what he\u2019s saying is he\u2019s like, these reflections will make it more appealing for some, to have a socialized medical insurance. Because there\u2019s going to be a recession, there\u2019s going to be a dip in the economy, there\u2019s going to be unemployment. And these people need taken care of. So on one hand, that that gets us into the global communism sort of argument. That\u2019s his point, though. He\u2019s saying that this is giving us time to reflect on what\u2019s important in our lives. And on top of that, he\u2019s saying that even if you open up the economy, do you no good anyway. That\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. Okay, let\u2019s read Oh, this is good. masks, the big drama, the big debate on mass. You already know where Santa Claus stands on this, but let\u2019s read it anyway. Just one simple example to illustrate the point. The World Health Organization and most national health authorities recommend that we were masking public side note, but you were called First they said not to because they were trying to save masks, but like, that\u2019s the problem with these people. They they they don\u2019t they assume we\u2019re all morons. And a lot of people are morons. So what\u2019s a fellow to do? Okay, just one simple example, then they recommend wearing a mask in public, what what has been framed as an epidemiological necessity and an easy risk mitigating measure has turned into a political battlefield, in the US, and also, but less so. In a few other countries. The decision to wear a mask or not has become politically charged, since it is considered as an infringement of personal freedom. But behind the political declaration, refusing to wear masks in public is a moral choice, as indeed is the decision to wear one. does this tell us something about the more principles that underpin our choices and decisions? Probably yes. So Klaus, he\u2019s on Team mask, shaming those that aren\u2019t suggesting it\u2019s a moral choice, which is kind of what I think. I mean, even if it only barely reduces the chance of me giving it to someone like I\u2019ll take it, I\u2019ll take a little bit, right. It\u2019s not that big of a deal to me. On top of that, you know, one time I was getting out of my car. Here\u2019s a real bleeding heart story. I was in a grocery store, getting out of my car. Didn\u2019t have my mask on yet. I was grabbing it because I\u2019m not like in love with the mask. Some people were like, in their car driving around, like, that\u2019s not me. So common sense about All right, get out of my car at all my mask on yet. And across for me is an elderly woman, I mean, really elderly, like she looked like 90. As she was getting out of her car, she had her mask on. And she gave me a look in my eyes, like she was terrified. And I was more than I was more than six feet away, I was just getting out of my vehicle to walk into put my mask on, right. And I felt really badly for her. And I thought this poor frickin woman man, this might be her last year on earth, and she\u2019s got to deal with this pandemic. And that just to me, and you know, it\u2019s my bleeding heart. To me that\u2019s supports the idea, like, Look, even if the thing doesn\u2019t work, like maybe this will make this woman feel better. This poor woman is her last year on Earth, maybe. And now she\u2019s got to be petrified of every person and walking around her.\n\nfat out there, man. That\u2019s, uh, he\u2019s talking about the moral choice here, right? And I\u2019m not I\u2019m not shaming the people that are anti masks. I don\u2019t agree with it. Like, Hey, I had a lot of people I love and respect that are anti masters. So like, that\u2019s not what this is. But, uh, you know, the anti masters they do have a good argument that sometimes they they, they believe it\u2019s a slippery slope into the mandatory stabby which could be true But to me, I\u2019d like to believe we can do one another. The other. I think that the stabbings are obviously more intrusive. It\u2019s not the same thing. It\u2019s two different things to me. Why am I doing that? I already got into a 30 minute debate on Instagram about this\n\nwith any rifle, he points out, do you remember when, when this kicked off, Amazon wouldn\u2019t allow price gouging for the basic necessities? Right? Remember that? Remember, the even corporate America with the retails chains and the grocery stores. They responded to the shortages by they didn\u2019t raise the price of the goods like supply and demand would dictate. Instead, they limited the quantity that each customer could buy. You remember when that guy went around buying up all the hand sanitizer and he was trying to sell it for to make all that money? And then, you know, the government somebody stepped in and broke that up was like, hey, dickhead. Like those are all good things, right? The See, this is the great reset. This is more evidence. It was unheard of before you know you you base our country\u2019s ideas on the free market laws of supply and demand. Now these guys are getting publicly shamed for doing this guy bought all the hands on, they shamed the shit out of this guy that forced them to give it up. I mean, what should we defend that creep? In the name of you know, this free market capitalism thing? I mean, maybe right, you could take that stance. I don\u2019t like that kind of world though. Myself. He talks about how mental health is going to get worse. Right. Now I agree with that. I mean, especially this year to what a what a frickin mess. You know. I was just getting ready to start hugging people for the first time in my life and then this happened now like No, never. Because I\u2019m not a hugger, right? I\u2019m just not a hugger. And I was like, This is my year. That was my new year\u2019s resolution. I\u2019m going to start hugging people more Not anymore. No All right, let\u2019s keep it moving. We got pages we got this book is long. I did you guys a solid reading this thing. Okay, here we go. Let\u2019s keep it moving. He\u2019s basically talking about how the great reset is a change of attitudes and perspectives. Mental Health being a huge component of this. He suggested mental health will the state of affairs will be worse, but we will devote more resources to fixing it. This was kind of like you know, we had all the mass shootings you want. You know, you want to reduce masters, you want reduce reliance on Big Pharma. You want less crime without an increased military police state. You got to get people mentally healthy. I don\u2019t disagree with that. He says that, basically, people are going to be more creative during the pandemic. And again, just another idea of how things will be different when we come out of the great reset here. He talks about how Isaac Newton he come up with that whole law of gravity thing after during a during a lockdown during a plague during the plague. Well, let me read it. Maybe I\u2019m wrong with that. Let me read it. He says, illustrious past episodes corroborate that creative characters thrive in lockdown Isaac Newton for one floors during the plague. And there you go. When Cambridge University had to shut down the summer 1665 after an outbreak knew went back to his family home and Lincoln Shire where he stayed for more than a year. Blah, blah, blah. Apple falls there. You know it didn\u2019t hit him in the head. That\u2019s a common wrong thought on that. It fell on the ground he saw unless the textbooks lied to me, which maybe they did. Who knows? Right? What do we believe anymore? Oh, here\u2019s another interesting idea. He talks about he says a few analysts forecast revenge consumption taking the form of a surge in spending after the lockdowns in predicting a strong revival of our animal spirits and in return to the situation that prevailed before the pandemic. And that\u2019s curious, right? Remember, Trump was saying he\u2019s like, the economy\u2019s gonna be on fire with this thing. And and here\u2019s the big thing. Here\u2019s what I want. Maybe you can remember I\u2019ll try to remember after you know, we\u2019ll say summer 2021. Is it right? Will there be revenge consumerism, because cloud all the Santa Claus here? He\u2019s saying no. He\u2019s saying, look, the the pandemic has shut things down. People have changed their perceptions on what\u2019s important in life. Spending time with the family, non monetary things, and that won\u2019t happen. That\u2019s what he says we\u2019ll see. We will see Okay, there go. final comment, because that\u2019s basically all he\u2019s talking about for a while, is these different ideas of things that\u2019ll be changed. When we come out of the great reset. I\u2019m going to read you a bit and then we\u2019re going to wrap it up. That said, the great reset is far from a done deal. Some may resist the necessity to engage in it fearful of the magnitude of the task and hopeful that the sense of urgency will subside, and the situation will soon get back to normal. The argument for passivity goes like this. We\u2019ve had we\u2019ve been through similar shocks, pandemics, harsh recessions, geopolitical divide social tensions before we\u2019ll get through them again. As always, societies will rebuild and Sobel, our economies, life goes on. The rationale for not resetting is also predicated on the conviction of the state of the world is not that bad, and then we just need to fix a few things around the edges to make it better. It is true that the state of the world today is on average considerably better than in the past, we must acknowledge that as human beings, we never had it so good. Almost all key indicators that measure our collective welfare have been continuously improving over past centuries, progressively, so in the last few decades, but they\u2019ve been improving on average, a statistical reality that is meaningless for those who feel and often are excluded. Therefore, the conviction that today\u2019s world is better than it has ever been, while correct cannot serve as an excuse for taking comfort in status quo and failing to fix the many ills that continue to afflict it. As economies restart, there\u2019s opportunity to embed greater social equality and sustainability into the recovery, accelerating rather than delaying progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and unleashing a new era of prosperity. What could make this possible raise the probability odds in favor of such an outcome? Now to the astute listener, you\u2019ll notice he referenced the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals document. That\u2019s the one that if you recall, mean, me in the guest, Johnny from Patreon, there. We were talking about that on a full episode. And like when you read through it, you\u2019re like, yeah, these are all good things, you know, to take care of each other and take care of the environment. Recall that. We were talking about how it could bring him out the End Times. And that\u2019s the fundamental idea behind this whole book. We need to look at these documents, these books and these ideas that these globalists are presenting and discern. Is this a nefarious trans humanistic satanic plot? Or are they just trying to improve the world? I like the idea of a reassessment against this unadulterated full market, free market capitalism at all costs. I\u2019d like to reassess that. I\u2019m not I look, I think America\u2019s Got the greatest economy, the greatest sort of society that ever did it right. And maybe that\u2019s my exceptionalism is my nationalism, talking, I don\u2019t know. But like, we already have mixed socialism inside of our system baked into it a little bit. But I like I like the idea of trying to get the air trees, water animals, taking care of a little bit better. need for better mental, mental and physical health. I think unchecked free market capitalism will slice its own throat eventually, you keep squeezing out the middle class, and it\u2019ll definitely eat its own in due time. So that\u2019s the whole book. That\u2019s the great reset right? on the on the face on the surface, it doesn\u2019t sound that bad. It really doesn\u2019t, when you read through it, but I\u2019m here to tell you, my friends. It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s bad. I mean, you got to stick with me through the rest of the shows to fully get a handle on why that is. On the end, like I said, this is I know so this is a heavy duty stuff for some people. That\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna put parts 234 and five on the Patreon and the rockfon. So if you want to support the research, the ideas me as a great podcast or host you know where to go patreon.com slash Illuminati watcher or rock fin comm slash creator slash Isaac, the links are in the show notes. Each has their own perks. I don\u2019t care which one you choose whichever one you like, that\u2019s the one you choose. rockfon is nice because you get one you pay one subscription fee, you get access to all the creators on there. You get Sam Tripoli from zero. You get Whitney Webb from unlimited Hangout. Jamie locks is on there. Now. I\u2019ve got an exclusive show. I do a couple shows a month called inside the mind of a conspiracy theorist. I was talking to Jay Dyer recently on that show. about him hanging out with Alex Jones. Patreon is not going anywhere either though I\u2019m doing both Patreon you get free ebooks. And both yet no commercials that\u2019s worth something right? Patreon you get more of a community vibe. We do live streams, all kinds of stuff. Shout outs you get on the shout outs monthly. Yeah, if you if you pick up the support on those you\u2019ll get. We\u2019re going to talk about on part two. We\u2019re going deeper into Klaus Schwab, the book he wrote on the fourth industrial revolution that gets into transhumanism, 5g, the Internet of Things. How does this all fit into the great reset? Well, it does. Then part three, we\u2019re going to go over j dyers talk, we\u2019re gonna talk about this World Economic Forum, eight point communist agenda, which to me is really terrifying. That\u2019s when the insidious nature of this thing starts to unfold. Then we go back in time, we\u2019re gonna talk about Bill Cooper\u2019s Behold a Pale Horse and how he was right all along. All the things we talked about all the things Klaus Schwab wants all the elements of the great reset all the parts of the World Economic Forum, eight points. He was telling you this 3040 years ago. Then we\u2019ll have a conclusion wrap up show.\n\nwe\u2019ll we\u2019ll wrap it all up with a bow. All right. I hope you enjoyed that. And look, if you want to go deeper, you can get his book. Oh, Klaus Schwab\u2019s book. I just read you that was all the notes from COVID-19 the great reset. And now that fits into the larger picture we\u2019ll understand in the future episodes.
