There are more than 200 different types of cancer, each with its own name and treatment. Although cells in different parts of the body may look and work differently, most repair and reproduce themselves in the same way. Normally, cells divide in an orderly and controlled way. But if for some reason the process gets out of control, the cells carry on dividing and develop into a lump called a tumour. Tumours are either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Doctors can tell if a tumour is benign or malignant by removing a piece of tissue (biopsy) and examining a small sample of cells under a microscope.\n\nIn a benign tumour the cells do not spread to other parts of the body and so are not cancerous. However, they may carry on growing at the original site, and may cause a problem by pressing on surrounding organs.\n\nIn a malignant tumour the cancer cells have the ability to spread beyond the original area of the body. If the tumour is left untreated, it may spread into surrounding tissue. Sometimes cells break away from the original (primary) cancer. They may spread to other organs in the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.\n\nThe lymphatic system is part of the immune system \u2013 the body\u2019s natural defence against infection and disease. It\u2019s made up of organs such as bone marrow, the thymus, the spleen, and lymph nodes. The lymph nodes throughout the body are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic tubes (ducts). The lymphatic system has two main roles: it helps to protect the body from infection and it drains fluid from the tissues.\n\nWhen the cancer cells reach a new area they may go on dividing and form a new tumour. This is known as a secondary cancer or a metastasis.\n\nCervical cancer is an uncommon type of cancer that develops in a woman\u2019s cervix. The cervix is the entrance to the womb from the vagina.\n\nCervical cancer often has no symptoms in its early stages. If you have symptoms, the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between periods or after the menopause.\n\nAbnormal bleeding doesn\u2019t mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it\u2019s a cause for concern. It\u2019s important to see a licensed health practitioner as soon as possible.\n\nOver the course of many years, the cells lining the surface of the cervix undergo a series of changes. In rare cases, these changed cells can become cancerous. However, cell changes in the cervix can be detected at a very early stage, and treatments can reduce the risk of cervical cancer developing.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Natural Cures for Cervical Cancer - NaturalCures.com", "description": "Find all Natural Cures for Cervical Cancer only on NaturalCures.com - the world's #1 resource of natural health cures and remedies, including Cervical Cancer .
