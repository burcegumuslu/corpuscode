Due to some loss of memory and a shoulder injury that required surgery following a bicycle injury in a Nashville park, she had to cancel all her fall concert dates.\n\nSeveral times throughout the Christmas concert at Lipscomb University held on Nov. 29, Grant expressed thankfulness that she was able to be a part of Lipscomb's gathering of Nashvillian's at the start of the Christmas season.\n\nProphet Tom Hughes Says a Sign of the End Times Is Everyone Taking Offense\n\nIn a recent YouTube video, prophet and lead pastor at 4|12 Church in San Jacinto, California, shared a powerful message from Jesus' words in Matthew 24.\n\nPastor Hughes compared Jesus' own words to the happenings across the world that are indicative of the End Times.\n\nAs Jesus spoke to His disciples on the Mount of Olives, He explained what would be happening in the world before His return.\n\nThe latest data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reveals that people who have had the COVID shots made up most of the COVID deaths in Aug. 2022.\n\nOf the total 6,512 Coronavirus deaths recorded in August, 58.6% of the deaths were attributed to vaccinated or boosted individuals. In addition, there is a growing trend where vaccinated individuals are increasingly becoming the majority in COVID mortalities.\n\nApproximately three in 10 adult Coronavirus fatalities in the fall of 2021 were vaccinated or boosted. But by Jan. 2022, approximately four in 10 COVID deaths were vaccinated or boosted. By April 2022, the CDC data showed that about six in 10 adult COVID deaths were vaccinated or boosted.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!
