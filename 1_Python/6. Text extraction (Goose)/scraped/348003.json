Details about the nature of the illness were not provided nor whether it was a placebo or vaccine participant.\n\nWithin America alone there are at least 7 coronavirus drug candidates being tested, with at least 4 moving to late-stage trials. This is not the first time a COVID-19 vaccine trial has been put on hold as recently a vaccine hopeful viral, AstraZeneca, also had to pause their late-stage trials after experiencing an \u201cunexplained illness\u201d (seemingly triggering an autoimmune response: Transverse Myelitis). Since then regulators in the UK, Brazil, India, and South Africa have allowed the trials to resume, however, in America the FDA is keeping the trials on hold while the agency widens its investigation in the best interest of public health and safety.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Trial Paused Due To \u201cUnexplained Illness\u201d", "description": "\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine trials have become the second candidate hopeful being paused due to the occurrence of an unexplained illness during the trials.", "url": "https://worldhealth.net/news/johnson-johnson-vaccine-trial-paused-due-unexplained-illness", "image": "https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_80034052.jpeg", "site_name": "WorldHealth"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
