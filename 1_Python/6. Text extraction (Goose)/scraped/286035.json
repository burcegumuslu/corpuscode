Ending this pandemic requires all of us working together to do our part, including encouraging our friends and family to get vaccinated. This effort will help more people make informed decisions about their health and learn about steps they can take to protect themselves and their communities.\u201d\n\nLater this month, McDonald\u2019s is also planning to push Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines\u201d on billboards in Times Square, which barely sees any traffic anymore ever since Andrew \u201cInfanticide\u201d Cuomo turned New York into a medical police state.\n\nThe push by McDonald\u2019s and the Biden White House comes as vaccination rates for the Wuhan Flu are declining.\n\nIt would appear as though Hunter\u2019s dad and his lackeys believe that the only people left who are refusing the injection are the type that eat at places like McDonald\u2019s on the regular, which is certainly laughable.\n\nIt only makes sense that a fake president would push fake vaccines for an overhyped pandemic that ended a long time ago. Most Americans, it would seem know this, as only a small fraction of the country is lining up to get injected.\n\nThe government knows this as well, which is why it is attempting every trick in the book to get those messenger RNA (mRNA) chemicals into people\u2019s bodies through any means possible, including by teaming up with McDonald\u2019s to teach people about \u201chealth.\u201d\n\nTo Read the rest go to this", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://newstarget.com/author/ethanh", "https://news.yahoo.com/mcdonald-introduces-redesigned-coffee-cups-165300266.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-02-18-andrew-cuomo-prosecuted-hiding-nursing-home-deaths.html", "https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/mcdonald-e2-80-99s-white-house-partner-to-promote-coronavirus-vaccine/ar-BB1gC1Yi?ocid=uxbndlbing", "https://newstarget.com/2021-05-14-mcdonalds-functioning-as-vaccine-propaganda-arm-cdc.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
