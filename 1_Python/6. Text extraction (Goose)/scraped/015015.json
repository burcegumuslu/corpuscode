We advocate to block bills that would mandate vaccination and support bills that protect your freedom of choice to make your own decisions for you and your family\u2019s health.\n\nRight to kNOw Evidence shows that autoimmune patients are at greater risk of serious adverse events from COVID vaccination. At the same time, there is increasing societal pressure to get vaccinated as privileges are conferred to those who choose to get the COVID vaccines. We believe the public should be fully informed of the risks of medical procedures and that autoimmune patients should not be discriminated against for refusing a procedure that is riskier for them.\n\nThe FDA is threatening to ban personalized compounded bioidentical hormones, like estriol, that millions of American women rely on. As the largest natural health non-profit engaging on this issue, we\u2019re educating Congress on the threat to these vital medications and fighting the FDA tooth and nail to protect access to compounded bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe FDA is threatening the very future of homeopathy, having declared all currently marketed homeopathic medicines to be illegal. ANH is working at all levels\u2014 grassroots, legislative, and legal to ensure consumers can access homeopathic medicines to support their health.\n\nANH works at the state level to advocate for legislation to permit the licensing of naturopathic doctors (ND). Licensure allows NDs to communicate their level of training and education to consumers. Importantly, ANH-supported ND licensure programs do not prohibit other health professionals, such as \u201ctraditional\u201d naturopaths who have not had the same training as NDs, from continuing to practice. Consumers should be able to decide for themselves what type of practitioner best fits their needs.\n\nANH works at the state level supporting bills to make sure that consumers can access the nutrition professionals that best suit their needs. Too often, particular trade associations, such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), try to exclude other professionals from practicing. In effect this often means that practitioners who don\u2019t ascribe to a narrow set of conventional practices are unable to compete. ANH advocates for free and open markets where consumers can choose which credentials and level of education they prefer.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health - ANH Protects Free Speech About Natural Health Modalities, Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy, Homeopathy and Access To Natural Therapies.", "type": "article", "title": "Health Autonomy - Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health", "description": "https://youtu.be/vfJTdTNwtUs ANH fights so that Americans can choose from a full menu of healthcare options because we have a right to take care of our bodies however we choose.
