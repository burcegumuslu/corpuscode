It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.[1]\n\nWhile the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Europe is decreasing, our analysis determined that the Pfizer mRNA boosters for OMICRON BA.4-5 variants, and the Moderna mRNA boosters for OMICRON BA.4-5 variants, are causing a significantly higher percentage of fatalities among the cases reported than the original COVID-19 shots.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the \u201creaction groups\u201d where the fatalities have been recorded.\n\nHow were so many millions of people worldwide convinced to take an experimental \u201cvaccine\u201d that has now caused millions of deaths and injuries worldwide?\n\nThis was the largest propaganda campaign in the history of the human race, using FEAR to intimidate people into agreeing to be injected with a bioweapon, or in many cases, coerced.\n\nWE MUST NEVER FORGET!\n\nThis is from checkur6 on Bitchute, who puts some faces onto these cold, hard statistics, as young people continued to \u201cdie suddenly\u201d through February, 2023.\n\nPlease do not allow your heart to become callous. Watch every minute of this video and the young people and children who are now dead, and allow yourself to weep for humanity, as I did when I watched this.\n\nClick here to watch the video.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above.
