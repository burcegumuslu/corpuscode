He is complicit in this in terms of facilitating human trafficking and basically giving away American jobs to people who do not have a natural birthright in this country,\u201d Vandersteel stated, pointing out that conniving with the president is the Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nAccording to a video played during the show, the American government pre-approves migrants for work before they come across the border and then gives them access to residency.\n\n\u201cPresident Joe Biden\u2019s historic mass migration is already changing for the final two years of his term. From news drone scenes of hundreds of thousands pouring in illegally every month to this,\u201d the narrator Todd Bensman, a senior national security fellow of the Center for Immigration Studies, annotated as the clip showed a multitude of U.S.-bound migrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras.\n\n\u201cThe millions who set off from distant homes planning to illegally cross the southern border are finally about to collect their prize. But everything is different for them and for potentially millions more hearing about this and coming to do it too.\u201d\n\nFrom the Mexican government shelter in Calexico, California, Mexico\u2019s Immigration Service will hand them over to their American counterparts for the official port of entry. The temporary legal status papers are already in their folders. Once Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processes them in, they\u2019re all released to begin permanent lives working in any American city of their choice, the short film revealed.\n\nVandesteel commented that it is looking pretty dire in terms of how big, pervasive and vast the expansion of the border is. \u201cJoe Biden is making this very available and he is ushering people in a highly coordinated fashion to not only get people cross the border and through processing, but also approving migrants for work before they actually come over,\u201d she said.\n\nThe host also expressed her disappointment as none of the people pouring into the U.S. are being checked for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). \u201cIf they\u2019re so concerned about COVID-19 and insisting on making sure that all people in America are vaccinated to mitigate the virus, why aren\u2019t they doing any of this to the immigrants? They\u2019re ushering these people into basically diluting the electorate in our country,\u201d Vandersteel pointed out.\n\nAccording to reports, there are already an estimated five million foreign nationals that have entered the U.S. illegally since Biden took office. (Related: Video shows camouflaged illegal aliens easily crossing southern border wall to enter US.)\n\nAs Biden moves to change the populace, patriots in the land are fighting election fraud.\n\nKari Lake, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Arizona, is confident that election fraud in her state will be exposed. \u201cThe way they run elections in Maricopa County is worse than in banana republics around this world,\u201d Lake told the Daily Mail.\n\nThe Republican candidate was commenting on Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich\u2019s office opening an inquiry into polling issues in the county, which includes Phoenix and other cities. Ballot-tabulation issues were confirmed by Maricopa County officials on Nov. 8.\n\nThe Associated Press has already called the race for Hobbs, but Lake is having none of it.\n\nVandersteel said Arizona\u2019s Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Wright demanded that the evidence be turned over before Maricopa County submits its official canvass to the Secretary of State who happens to be \u201cthe same lady who was running for governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Katie Hobbs, that corrupt woman, can you believe she hasn\u2019t even excused herself or recused herself after this has just blown up at all of their faces?\u201d Vandesteel said, adding Lake is going to restore election integrity.\n\nVisit BorderSecurity.news for more news related to the millions of border crossers allowed and supported by the Biden regime.\n\nWatch the full Nov. 21 episode of \u201cThe Zelenko Report\u201d with Ann Vandersteel below.
