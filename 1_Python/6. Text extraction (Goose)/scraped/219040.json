Organizers have not said when the protest will end.\n\n\u201cLet me assure the people of Ottawa that we have no intent to stay one day longer than necessary,\u201d Tamara Lich, one of the convoy\u2019s organizers, told reporters last week, according to the Post.\n\n\u201cOur departure will be based on the prime minister doing what is right: Ending all mandates and restrictions on our freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is something that is different in our democracy than I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life,\u201d he said Saturday, according to the Post.\n\n\u201cThe demonstrators \u2026 remain highly organized, well-funded, extremely committed to resisting all attempts to end the demonstrations safely,\" the Post added.\n\n\"This remains, as it was from the beginning, an increasingly volatile and increasingly dangerous demonstration.\u201d\n\nA report in the Ottawa Citizen said that Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said that policing the protest \u201cis a responsibility carried out by local police services across Ontario, who have the resources and authority to ensure their communities remain safe. Politicians at all levels cannot direct the police. To be clear: police services, including the Ottawa Police Service, have full discretion and extensive existing legislative authority under the Criminal Code to respond to and manage demonstrations and take enforcement action, as appropriate, against any individuals committing crimes in their jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation at this point is completely out of control, because the individuals with the protest are calling the shots,\u201d he said in a radio interview Sunday, according to the Ottawa Citizen.\n\n\u201cThey have far more people than we have police officers, and I\u2019ve indicated to the chief that we have to be much more nimble and proactive when it comes to these activities.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday issued a statement in support of the truckers.\n\n\u201cThe Freedom Convoy is peacefully protesting the harsh policies of far-left lunatic Justin Trudeau who has destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates,\u201d Trump said in his statement.\n\nThe statement scolded efforts to block a similar convoy in America from using social media to organize. On Wednesday, Facebook removed the personal account of a man organizing a \u201cConvoy to D.C. 2022,\u201d according to Fox News.\n\n\u201cNow, thankfully, the Freedom Convoy could be coming to DC with American Truckers who want to protest Biden\u2019s ridiculous Covid policies,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement said.\n\n\"Facebook is canceling the accounts of Freedom Convoy USA, and GoFundMe is denying access to funds that belong to the Freedom Convoy.\n\n\"This is unacceptable and extremely dangerous in any country that values free expression.\"", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/Canadian-Police-Warn-Anyone-Supporting-Freedom-Convoy-Will-Be-Arrested.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Canadian Police Warn Anyone Supporting Freedom Convoy Will Be Arrested", "description": "'Demonstrators exhibited extremely disruptive and unlawful behavior' - Ottawa police have warned supporters warned those supporting the Freedom Convoy protesting&n... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Truck", "Protest"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Don\u2019t forget\u2026<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a> could end the truckers mission by simply\u2026NOT being a tyrannical authoritarian.<br/><br/>Multiple countries are dropping all mandates.
