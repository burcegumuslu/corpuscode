The company wrote on its website that they have been working for the past four years towards developing a vaccine against a form of coronavirus which infects chickens called avian coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV).\n\n\u201cOur basic concept was to develop the technology and not specifically a vaccine for this kind or that kind of virus,\u201d said Dr. Chen Katz, MIGAL\u2019s biotechnology group leader, told J-Post. \u201cLet\u2019s call it pure luck. We decided to choose coronavirus as a model for our system just as a proof of concept for our technology.\u201d\n\nFrom research conducted at MIGAL, it has been found that the poultry coronavirus has high genetic similarity to the human COVID-19, and that it uses the same infection mechanism, a fact that increases the likelihood of achieving an effective human vaccine in a very short period of time.\n\nThe vaccine\u2019s effectiveness has been proven in pre-clinical trials carried out at the Volcani Institute. MIGAL has now made required genetic adjustments to adapt the vaccine to COVID-19, the human strain of coronavirus, and is working to achieve the safety approvals that will enable in-vivo testing, enable the initiation of production of a vaccine to counter the Coronavirus epidemic.\n\nCommenting on the news, David Zigdon, CEO of MIGAL GALILEE RESEARCH INSTITUTE, said, \u201cGiven the urgent global need for a human coronavirus vaccine, we are doing everything we can to accelerate development. Our goal is to produce the vaccine during the next 8-10 weeks, and to achieve safety approval in 90 days. This will be an oral vaccine, making it particularly accessible to the general public. We are currently in intensive discussions with potential partners that can help accelerate the in-human trials phase and expedite the completion of the final product development and regulatory activities.\u201d\n\nMinister Akunis instructed the Director-General of the Ministry of Science and Technology to fast-track all approval processes with the goal of bringing the human vaccine to market as quickly as possible.\n\nIn conjunction with this miraculous discovery, another Israeli firm announced on Thursday that its biomedical division developed a new rapid and accurate diagnostics kit for the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. BATM Advanced, a leading provider of technologies for medical laboratory system based in Hod Hasharon, said in a release that \u201cthe kit has undergone testing by several central laboratories and hospitals that have now verified its ability to diagnose COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kit has undergone testing by several central laboratories and hospitals that have now verified its ability to diagnose COVID-19,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe Group has commenced production of the kit at its Adaltis facility in Rome. BATM is working with academic and research institutions, mainly in Europe, to progress the kit to make it at a price point suitable for large scale production. The kit, which supports all the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, has already received interest from customers in several countries.\u201d\n\nThe current methods being used to test for the virus is an involved process that takes several days at least. There have been more than 80,000 cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and 2,700 deaths.\n\nThe virus was named for its appearance. During their research, scientists used microscopes to photograph the virus and the name comes from its shape, which resembles a crown when imaged, a fact which led Rabbi Aryeh Lipo, a religious studies teacher who ran for the Likud in 2014, to an insight on the cause of the pandemic.\n\n\u2018corona\u2019 means, in every language, a crown,\u201d Rabbi Lipo said. \u201cThe disease has come to remind us that the true crown of the world is missing. What will stop the coronavirus was taught to us by King David.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay it be God\u2019s will that we merit to build a crown and palace for the One King,\u201d Rabbi Lipo said. \u201cGod willing, this crown will protect the world from the corona.\u201d\n\nusing an electron microscope. Corona is Latin for \u2018Crown\u2019.\n\nAmerican Jewish Committee CEO David Harris threw down the gauntlet to the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement in a tweet.\n\n\n\n Seth Mandel, a conservative American author who is Jewish, tweeted a taunt to the BDS movement.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Challenge Issued to BDS: Through A Miraculous Coincidence, Israel May Have Coronavirus Vaccine Ready in 90 Days", "description": "Jewish leaders issue challenges to BDS after Israeli companies take the lead in battling the coronavirus.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/336602/through-miraculous-coincidence-israel-may-have-coronavirus-vaccine-ready-in-90-days/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/adameliyahu", "article:published_time": "2020-02-28T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1658048668.jpg", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Uncategorized", "Health and Science"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> spreads, Israeli researchers seek ways to combat it.</p>\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Israel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Israel</a> is helping advance the frontiers of human knowledge &amp; make the world a better place. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BDS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BDS</a> supporters, will you boycott any new Israeli anti-coronavirus medicines? <a href=\"https://t.co/yM5sT6twB4\">https://t.co/yM5sT6twB4</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 David Harris (@DavidHarrisAJC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidHarrisAJC/status/1232985650485432321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Good luck boycotting this, anti-Semites.<a href=\"https://t.co/IC2L21Cb9z\">https://t.co/IC2L21Cb9z</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Jewish Journal (@JewishJournal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JewishJournal/status/1233210949210787840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 28, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Israeli-scientists-In-three-weeks-we-will-have-coronavirus-vaccine-619101", "https://www.migal.org.il/Migal.covid", "https://www.batm.com/", "https://www.www.israel365news.com/144383/kabbalah-expert-links-coronavirus-to-divine-punishment-for-chinas-modern-day-death-of-firstborn-plague/", "https://theisraelbible.com/glossary/david/", "https://theisraelbible.com/glossary/yisrael/", "https://theisraelbible.com/bible/2-samuel/chapter-24#verse-24", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Israel?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BDS?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/yM5sT6twB4", "https://twitter.com/DavidHarrisAJC/status/1232985650485432321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/IC2L21Cb9z", "https://twitter.com/JewishJournal/status/1233210949210787840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "authors": ["Adam Eliyahu Berkowitz"], "publish_date": "2020-02-28T00:00:00+00:00"}
