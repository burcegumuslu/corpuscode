On April 6, the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iran met for the first time in seven years. A month earlier, top national security officials of the two countries had stunned the world, re-establishing diplomatic relations after years of hostility that had raised tensions across their shared neighbourhood. But the meetings that led to the dramatic breakthrough were not held in the Middle East. They were hosted and mediated by China, after years of unsuccessful attempts by Oman and Iraq. In the West, China\u2019s central role in keeping Russia\u2019s economy afloat despite sanctions, and Beijing\u2019s unwillingness to even question Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine have drawn sharp criticism. Yet experts say its newfound success as a peacemaker in the Middle East signals a shift for China, which has traditionally hesitated from involving itself too deeply in efforts to resolve global conflicts.\n\nBarbie is launching its first doll with Down\u2019s syndrome in an effort to help more children find a toy that represents them. Mattel bosses said they wanted to bring out the doll to \u201cenable all children to see themselves in Barbie\u201d. They partnered with the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) in the US to bring the product to market. The move was welcomed by charities, with Carol Boys, chief executive of the UK Down\u2019s Syndrome Association, saying: \u201cChildren in our community will be able to play with a doll that represents them.\u201d Ellie Goldstein, a British model with Down\u2019s syndrome who has appeared in a campaign with the new Barbie, said she was \u201cso happy\u201d to see the new doll. She added: \u201cDiversity is important to me as people need to see more people like me out there in the world and not be hidden away.\u201d\n\nDisney begins largest wave of layoffs, targeting thousands at ESPN, Parks, and other divisions Disney is laying off several thousand workers across the company this week in the second and largest wave of cuts as part of the media giant\u2019s previously announced plan to slash its workforce by 7,000 employees. The latest round of job cuts will impact ESPN, Disney\u2019s entertainment division, Disney Parks, and its Experiences and Product division as part of a larger workforce reduction plan announced in February by chief executive Bob Iger in an aim to save $5.5 billion in costs, the company said. The company had suspended its dividend payments during the pandemic, but Iger announced in February that he expects them to return. The cuts this week are expected to take place Monday through Thursday, affecting employees from coast to coast, Disney said. The latest round of layoffs comes after an initial wave last month, and will bring the total number of jobs lost across the company to 4,000, it said. The layoffs, however, are not expected to affect hourly frontline employees at Disney\u2019s theme parks and resorts. A third and final wave of layoffs to reach the 7,000 total is expected before the beginning of summer, the company said. Disney had about 220,000 workers as of October 1, of which approximately 166,000 were employed in the United States. A cut of 7,000 jobs represents about 3% of its global workforce.\n\nWHO warns of biological risk after Sudan fighters seize lab, as violence mars US-brokered ceasefire The World Health Organization has warned of a \u201chuge biological risk\u201d after one of the warring parties in Sudan occupied the central public health laboratory in the capital Khartoum, as Western and Asian nations raced to mount rapid evacuation efforts from the country and violence punctured a fragile US-brokered ceasefire. Gunfire and the roar of fighter jets was heard by CNN journalists in Khartoum on Tuesday, half a day after the announcement of a 72-hour truce raised hopes of opening up escape routes for civilians desperate to flee. The Sudanese army and the paramilitary group battling it for control of the country accused each other of violating the agreement. Nima Saeed Abid, the WHO representative in Sudan, provided details of the laboratory occupation during a video briefing on Tuesday, describing it as \u201cextremely dangerous because we have polio isolates in the lab, we have measles isolates in the lab, we have cholera isolates in the lab.\u201d \u201cThere is a huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab in Khartoum by one of the fighting parties,\u201d he added, though he did not say which side had taken control of the lab.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["CNN", "President Joe Biden"], "tweets": [],
