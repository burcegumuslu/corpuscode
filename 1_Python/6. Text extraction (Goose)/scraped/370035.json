It has multiple types and among them the most common form is AIDP (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy). In AIDP the protective covering of the nerves known as myelin sheath is damaged. Due to this damage the nerves are not able to send proper signals to the brain and weakness , numbness and paralysis can arise. It has been found that in most cases it occurs some days or weeks after a respiratory illness or a digestive tract infection. Persons of any age group can be affected with this but the risk increases with advancing age. Its chances are more in males as compared to females.\n\nIt can be triggered after an infection with campylobacter jejuni bacteria (most times found in undercooked poultry). Some other infections have also been associated that can trigger it. These include cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), AIDS causing HIV virus, mycoplasma pneumonia and zika virus. Hepatitis A, B, C and E, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma are also associated with the occurrence of this syndrome.
