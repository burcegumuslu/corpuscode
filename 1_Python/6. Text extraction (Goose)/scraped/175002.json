But the small percentage who do can also overwhelm the health care system. Everyone wants to talk about the first problem. No one wants to talk about the second.\n\nLast week, an extensive list of articles from the peer-reviewed medical literature was posted on Reddit by someone known only as xxyiorgos. More than 400 articles are on that list (backup link here).\n\nHere are the first 100. I\u2019ve numbered, and verified them. In some cases, I\u2019ve updated the hyperlink.
