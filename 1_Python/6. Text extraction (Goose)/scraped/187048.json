On April 29, the Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 2006 \u2013 which prevents both government agencies and private businesses from requiring people to show proof of vaccination before availing of a product or service. The bill bolsters an executive order signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis early that month prohibiting the use of vaccine passports.\n\nAccording to the bill, \u201cany business operating in this state may not require patrons or customers to provide any documentation certifying COVID-19 vaccination or post-infection recovery to gain access to, entry upon or service from the business operations in this state.\u201d Businesses who flout the state government\u2019s vaccine passport ban can face fines of up to $5,000 per violation.\n\nThe bill also extended to government offices and educational institutions. It said that these two \u201cmay not require persons to provide any documentation certifying COVID-19 vaccination or post-infection recovery\u201d as a pre-requisite for service. However, the bill provided caveats for both entities: They are still permitted to institute \u201cscreening protocols in accordance with state or federal law to protect public health.\u201d\n\nBased on its text, SB 2006 appears to take DeSantis\u2019s vaccine passport ban a step further. ClickOrlando.com reported that the governor signed an executive order on April 2 banning the use of such passports in the state. \u201cRequiring so-called COVID-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life \u2026 would create two classes of citizens based on vaccination, the order said.\u201d It continued that vaccines are not required in Florida and a person\u2019s decision to get vaccinated is private health information.\n\nThe Republican governor has been vocal about his opposition to vaccine passports. He slammed such documents as unnecessary during a March 30 press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of [vaccination] to just simply be able to participate in normal society,\u201d he said. (Related: South Koreans without vaccine passports will not be able to go to work and enter stores.)\n\nThe joint effort by Florida\u2019s legislative and executive branches gives more legal basis for banning vaccine passports\n\nWith the Florida Legislature passing SB 2006, it only needs DeSantis\u2019s signature to become a law. State Rep. Anthony Sabatini announced the bill\u2019s passing in a tweet. His Apr. 29 post said: \u201cJust voted to ban vaccine passports in Florida. [The] bill passed 76-40.\u201d\n\nThe GOP state lawmaker previously remarked that DeSantis\u2019s April 2 executive order ought to be passed into law. \u201cThis [executive] order is immediate, but must be passed into law. As a state [representative], I\u2019ll be fighting to make sure this law passes [as soon as possible],\u201d Sabatini earlier tweeted.\n\nSabatini told National File that he and his allies in the Florida Legislature are trying to \u201climit the role of local governments to interfere with people\u2019s personal lives and liberty, including medical freedom.\u201d He added that they were \u201cpushing back\u201d against \u201cbusinesses in [the] state [and] woke corporations.\u201d These entities aim to \u201cmandate vaccines and control the lives of every consumer,\u201d Sabatini argued. (Related: Former Clinton adviser warns that vaccine passports could lead to \u201cend of human liberty.\u201d)\n\nThe state lawmaker continued: \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018woke\u2019 corporations [such as the] airlines [and] the cruise industry. They\u2019re the ones who would have tried to require a vaccine passport.\u201d He also exhorted other GOP states to use Florida\u2019s new law as a model. \u201cPass the same exact bill. Take the bill and pass it in every state in the country,\u201d Sabatini commented.\n\nBut according to Lawrence Gostin, director of Georgetown University\u2018s O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, the Florida governor\u2019s executive order was unlikely to have an impact. However, he remarked that laws passed by state legislatures \u2013 such as SB 2006 \u2013 may be more effective in curtailing moves by local governments to mandate vaccine passports.\n\nHe told NBC News via an email: \u201cGovernors [such as DeSantis] have no power to prohibit cities or counties from issuing passports or banning the private sector. But if the [Florida Legislature] or other state legislature passed a law, it could pre-empt local governments from issuing passports.\u201d\n\nA number of GOP states \u2013 such as Texas, Arizona and South Dakota \u2013 have followed the footsteps of Florida by issuing executive orders that ban vaccine passports. However, it remains to be seen if their respective legislatures will pass laws similar to what the Sunshine State did.\n\nVisit MedicalTyranny.com to read more news about the fight against COVID-19 vaccine passports.", "opengraph": {"title": "Florida lawmakers pass bill banning vaccine passports in the state", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2021-05-11-florida-lawmakers-bill-total-ban-vaccine-passports.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Legislators in Florida passed a bill instituting a total ban on vaccine passports in the Sunshine State.
