You\u2019ll Live In Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nA shocking new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today first noting top infectious disease specialist Doctor-Scientist Vladislav Zhemchugov stating that a sudden sharp increase in novel coronavirus cases in Russia is possible only under a \u201cvery unlikely\u201d scenario of a new strain, says this hopeful assessment comes as a batch of 400,000 doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V COVID-19 jab has just been delivered to Bolivia, a second shipment of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has just been delivered to India and the use of the Sputnik Light vaccine has now been approved in Venezuela\u2014but while Russia aids the world in battling back against the scourge of this pandemic, sees its efforts being bitterly opposed by the United States and European Union\u2014which caused First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyanskiy to \u201cslam as shameful\u201d this vile US-EU diplomatic war against Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, and his warning: \u201cWe are living in the post-truth world when nobody pays attention to what is really happening and there are a lot of sources who present information in a distorted way, which is very often quite far from reality...All these factors bring us to a very dangerous moment in international relations\u201d.\n\nAstonishingly agreeing with First Deputy Polyanskiy is \u2019s second largest newspaper the Wall Street Journal\u2014who in a just published article written by Senior Fellow Lance Morrow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center entitled \u201cCan Freedom Survive the Narratives?\u201d further warns: \u201cWe live in the age of supercharged story lines, most of which are demagogic nonsense...caused by Wokeness...which is a politics that manages to be both prissy and vicious...is a totalitarian social design that flies the flag of everything good and nice...and in reality fronts for the real problem of the 21st century: a sinister autocracy just around the corner\u201d.\n\nIn this \u201cpost-truth world\u201d where America is fast becoming \u201ca sinister autocracy\u201d, it was no surprise to see the American Academy of Microbiology electing to its membership Communist Chinese military scientist Shibo Jiang\u2014a Communist Chinese military scientist long funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health\u2014recently saw the prestigious Bulletin of Atomic Scientists publishing their bombshell research paper \u201cThe Origin Of COVID: Did People Or Nature Open Pandora\u2019s Box At Wuhan?\u201d, wherein it documents how Dr. Fauci secretly paid Communist China to create novel coronaviruses\u2014which makes it more than explainable why Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are demanding that Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines provide more information on the origins of COVID-19, claiming that new evidence has emerged that appears to show the virus first originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab\u2014a place that gave Dr. Fauci his title \u201cPatron Saint of Wuhan\u201d\u2014and in America, sees one being able to buy Saint Fauci Religious Candles.\n\nNow joining this human catastrophe America is fast turning itself into, yesterday it saw demonic posts made by CNN contributor Adeel Raja being revealed, that beyond shockingly said: \u201cHail Hitler!...Hitler was a good German and he did good with those jews!...The world today needs a Hitler\u201d\u2014demonic posts that were soon followed by Dr. Fauci giving an address to socialist idiot graduates at Emory University, where he claimed that Covid-19 has revealed the \u201cundeniable racism\u201d in the United States, and then stated to them: \u201cRighting this wrong will take a decades-long commitment\u2026I urge you to be part of that commitment\u201d.\n\nBeing kept from the knowledge of the American people by their leftist propaganda corporate media, however, is the brutal truth that the call CNN made for a new Hitler isn\u2019t needed, as for decades they\u2019ve had in their midst one of the greatest genocidal maniacs their nation has ever created\u2014whom the entire world knows as Dr. Anthony Fauci, most specifically the grieving American families of the over 700,000 who\u2019ve died in the HIV-AIDS epidemic\u2014an epidemic Dr. Fauci exploited to gain political power\u2014saw him striking terror into America when he claimed without evidence or proof that merely by sitting next to someone with AIDS a person would be infected with this deadly disease\u2014which is why 30-years ago, the late Dr. Robert Willner (who wrote the groundbreaking book \u201cDeadly Deception the Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely Do Not Cause AIDS\u201d, and Dr. Fauci then destroyed) delivered one of the most remarkable press conferences ever seen, wherein he factually stated: \u201cHitler would envy the job being done at the National Institutes of Health, and even the media...and I will put the lie to the names of the individuals of the NIH...particularly Fauci...and the rest of these scoundrels of the worst order...criminals guilty of genocide without a doubt\u201d.

Biden Needs To Clean It Up\u201d\u2014wherein it admits that masks have nothing at all to do with preventing the spread of COVID, and reveals that their only purpose is to keep despotic control over the American people\u2014sees this manifesto declaring that: \u201cThe Biden administration must admit to the American people that CDC\u2019s guidance was released prematurely and without considering all the implications and unintended consequences\u201d\u2014and sees this manifesto demanding that mask decisions not be left to medical science and facts, because \u201ccomplex decisions need to involve other agencies and stakeholders\u201d.\n\nNot being understood by the masses of normal and sane Americans while they watch this socialist insanity, this report concludes, is exactly how their capitalist nation actually works\u2014a guide to which was interestingly provided this past week by the leftist New York Times in their insightful article \u201cThis Is How Wokeness Ends\u201d\u2014which while noting that \u201cWokeness or social justice or critical race theory \u2014 is sweeping across America the way Bolshevism swept across the Russian Empire before the October Revolution in 1917\u201d, describes the future of what\u2019s soon to come by revealing what\u2019s happened in the past when threats like this arise:\n\nPeople who engage in this discourse have been enculturated by our best and most expensive schools. If you look at the places where the splashy woke controversies have taken place, they have often been posh prep schools, like Harvard-Westlake or , or pricey colleges, like Bryn Mawr or .\n\nThe meritocracy at this level is very competitive. Performing the discourse by canceling and shaming becomes a way of establishing your status and power as an enlightened person. It becomes a way of showing \u2014 despite your secret self-doubts \u2014 that you really belong. It also becomes a way of showing the world that you are anti-elite, even though you work, study and live in circles that are extremely elite.\n\nThe meritocracy has one job: to funnel young people into leadership positions in society.\n\nIt\u2019s very good at doing that. Corporations and other organizations are eager to hire top performers, and one sign of elite credentials is the ability to do the discourse.\n\nThat\u2019s why the C.I.A. made that widely mocked recruiting video that was like a woke word salad: cisgender, intersectional, patriarchal.\n\nThe people at the C.I.A., Disney, Major League Baseball and Coca-Cola aren\u2019t faking it when they perform the acts we now call woke capitalism. They went to the same schools and share the same dominant culture and want the same reputational benefits.\n\nBut as the discourse gets more corporatized it\u2019s going to get watered down.\n\nThe primary ideology in is success; that ideology has a tendency to absorb all rivals.\n\nWe saw this happen between the 1970s and the 1990s. American hippies built a genuinely bohemian counterculture.\n\nBut as they got older they wanted to succeed.\n\nThey brought their bohemian values into the market, but year by year those values got thinner and thinner and finally were nonexistent.\n\nCorporations and other establishment organizations co-opt almost unconsciously.\n\nThey send ambitious young people powerful signals about what level of dissent will be tolerated while embracing dissident values as a form of marketing.\n\nBy taking what was dangerous and aestheticizing it, they turn it into a product or a brand.\n\nPretty soon key concepts like \u201cprivilege\u201d are reduced to empty catchphrases floating everywhere.\n\nMay 17, 2021 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
