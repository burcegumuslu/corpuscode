The group is headed by the former CDC director.\n\nU.S. Rep.

Besser. Besser has been leading RWJF since April 2017. Besser\u2019s bio on the RWJF website states \u2013 \u201cBesser is the former acting director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d\n\nBesser\u2019s bio further explains that he worked as director of the \u2018Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response\u2019 at the CDC, then he joined ABC News in 2009, where he was the chief health and medical director.\n\n\u201cHe also served as acting director of the CDC from January to June 2009, during which time he led the CDC\u2019s response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic.\u201d\n\nReaders of GreatGameIndia would remember how the WHO faked the H1N1 pandemic a decade ago on behalf of the vaccine lobby.\n\nInterestingly, while Factcheck.org has directly denied Rep. Massie\u2019s accusation of bias in the article, \u201cSciCheck and our Commitment to Transparency,\u201d it ignores the possibility of bias stemming from Besser\u2019s former role at the CDC.\n\nFactCheck.org defended itself against Rep. Massie\u2019s accusation of bias, saying, \u201cContrary to Massie\u2019s suggestion, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \u2014 as is the case with all of our funders \u2014 has no control over our editorial content. Period. Full stop.\u201d\n\nHowever, Massie nowhere says that RWJF has \u201ccontrol\u201d over the editorial content of FactCheck.org. It is commonly acknowledged that outside parties can exercise influence upon an organization in a more indirect manner, such as through quid pro quo exchanges.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that FactCheck.org partnered with Facebook \u201cshortly after the 2016\u201d allegedly in order to \u201cdebunk hoaxes and malicious falsehoods posted on the social media site,\u201d according to the University of Pennsylvania Almanac.\n\nFor extensively exposing the Vaccine lobby, GreatGameIndia is being targeted and being accused of spreading misinformation for the flimsy reason that our tweets were shared widely after the controversy.\n\nWe need your support to carry on our independent and investigative research based journalism on the Deep State threats facing humanity.
