Because they see that the whole world is on your side..\u201d\n\n\u201c..Even saying we\u2019re gonna put Abrams tanks in, I think, would be enough for Germany to unleash [its Leopard tanks]\u201d\n\nUS Representative Michael McCaul has argued that announcing plans to provide America\u2019s vaunted M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine \u2013 even if only one of the behemoths is actually shipped out \u2013 would leave Germany with no excuses to further delay sending its Leopard tanks to Kiev. \u201cIf we announced we were going to give Abrams tanks, just one\u2026 what I hear is that Germany is waiting for us to take the lead,\u201d McCaul said on Sunday in an ABC News interview. \u201cThen they would put Leopard tanks in.\u201d The Texas Republican, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, added that such a tactic also would prompt Berlin to give its permission for other European countries that use the Leopard to give some of their tanks to Ukraine. McCaul has been among the most hawkish Republicans in the House, vowing to continue providing weaponry for Ukraine to fight Russian forces, regardless of growing public opposition to the aid. He claimed that Kiev must be provided tanks and longer-range artillery urgently, to help repel an alleged imminent offensive by the Russians. Asked by ABC anchor Martha Raddatz whether just one Abrams tank would be sufficient to trigger Germany to provide more advanced weaponry to Ukraine, McCaul hinted that Washington could trick its ally.\u201d Even saying we\u2019re gonna put Abrams tanks in, I think, would be enough for Germany to unleash [its Leopard tanks]\u201d McCaul also said Kiev needs longer-range artillery to strike targets in Crimea, dismissing the risks of enabling attacks on the peninsula, which Moscow considers to be sovereign Russian territory. Asked how Russian President Vladimir Putin might react, McCaul pointed to how Washington apparently got away with past escalations in aid, such as giving Ukraine HIMARS rocket launchers. Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, also called for sending battle tanks to Ukraine. \u201cIf it requires our sending some Abrams tanks in order to unlock getting the Leopard tanks from Germany, from Poland, from other allies, I would support that,\u201d he told Raddatz. Media reports suggested that Berlin was unwilling to send its tanks unless the US made a similar commitment. Washington has so far refused to provide its Abrams tanks, arguing that they are very complex to operate and require extensive training. Key NATO nations failed to reach an agreement about sending the German-made battle tanks to Ukraine during a Friday meeting of Western military donors at the US Ramstein air base. However, on Sunday, Germany\u2019s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock hinted that Berlin \u201cwould not stand in the way\u201d if Poland decides to sends its own Leopards to Ukraine.\n\n\u201c..only \u201creal and effective support\u201d in the form of weaponry that Ukrainian forces can actually use on the battlefield without months or years of training..\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reaffirmed their continued \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d in a joint press conference on Sunday, but both said that any decision on supplying heavier arms must be reached jointly by all \u201cfriends\u201d of Kiev. Macron said that \u201cnothing is excluded\u201d when asked about the possibility of sending Leclerc main battle tanks to Kiev, and confirmed he had \u201casked the Defense Ministry to work on it.\u201d However, any final decision would have to be a \u201ccollective\u201d call based on several considerations, he noted, according to AFP. France does not want the move to \u201cweaken our own defense capabilities,\u201d and at the same time is cautious of \u201cescalating\u201d the conflict. Another concern is to provide only \u201creal and effective support\u201d in the form of weaponry that Ukrainian forces can actually use on the battlefield without months or years of training. Scholz dodged a similar question about Leopards, saying vaguely that Germany \u201cwill continue to act according to the concrete situation\u201d and in close coordination with \u201cimportant friends and allies.\u201d \u201cGermany is doing a lot, too\u2026 We have constantly expanded our deliveries with very effective weapons that are already available today,\u201d the chancellor said. Last week, Politico reported that Paris was considering deliveries of Leclerc tanks in an effort to provide a joint framework to overcome Germany\u2019s reluctance. Amid reports that Berlin was unwilling to send its tanks unless the US made a similar move, a US lawmaker proposed giving Ukraine a single Abrams tank to leave Berlin with no excuses for further delays. Calls for Germany to supply Kiev with Leopards grew louder after the UK confirmed earlier this month that it would send 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine. Poland also announced that it would transfer a company of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, but the re-export of these tanks must be greenlit by Germany. On Sunday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock hinted that Berlin \u201cwould not stand in the way\u201d if Poland makes the move. Baerbock noted that Warsaw has not yet reached out to Berlin on the matter. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the \u201cimportance of such supplies in terms of their ability to change something\u201d on the battlefield should not be exaggerated.\n\nThe continuous flow of military aid to Kiev clearly shows that the collective West is seeking to \u201cwear out or, preferably, destroy\u201d Russia, the country\u2019s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, remarked on Sunday. The effort, however, may ultimately backfire for the US and its allies, he believes. Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, made the comments in a social media post, days after a meeting at the US Ramstein air base in Germany at which Western powers pledged to continue supporting Kiev. \u201cThe meeting at Ramstein and the allocation of heavy weaponry to Kiev leave no doubt that our enemies will be trying to wear us out for an indefinite period of time, or, preferably, to destroy us,\u201d the ex-president wrote. \n\n However, the prolongation of the hostilities in Ukraine may ultimately lead to the emergence of a new military bloc that brings together nations \u201cfed up with the Americans,\u201d Medvedev suggested. \u201cThis has always happened in the history of mankind during long wars. And the US then will finally abandon old Europe and what remains of the unfortunate Ukrainians, and the world will return to an equilibrium once again,\u201d the former leader said, warning, however, that it might be \u201ctoo late\u201d before this happens. Moscow has repeatedly urged the collective West to stop \u201cpumping\u201d Ukraine with weapons, maintaining that it would only prolong the hostilities rather than change the ultimate outcome. Top Russian officials have repeatedly characterized what is happening as a proxy war between Russia and the US-led NATO alliance rather than merely a conflict with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cDodon said Sandu made her statement after meeting in Davos with Alexander Soros, son of Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, \u201cwho brought her to power.\u201d\n\nMoldovan President Maia Sandu has put the former Soviet republic at risk of turning into \u201ccannon fodder\u201d in NATO\u2019s proxy war with Russia by failing to remain neutral over the conflict in neighboring Ukraine, her predecessor said on Saturday. \u201cMaia Sandu continues to draw Moldova into NATO \u2013 contrary to the neutrality prescribed in the Constitution and the will of the Moldovan people, who are categorically against joining this military structure,\u201d ex-President Igor Dodon claimed in a Telegram post. He made his comments in response to Sandu\u2019s statement on Friday that her government was seriously considering joining a \u201clarger alliance\u201d amid Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine. Abandoning military neutrality would be \u201cdangerous\u201d for Moldova, said Dodon, who served as president from 2016 until Sandu defeated him in the country\u2019s 2020 election. The nation of just 2.6 million people consistently ranks among the poorest countries in Europe and has maintained a delicate peace with its breakaway Transnistria region since agreeing to a 1992 ceasefire, brokered by Moscow. Dodon said Sandu made her statement after meeting in Davos with Alexander Soros, son of Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, \u201cwho brought her to power.\u201d He added, \u201cObviously, Sandu is implementing his scenario in Moldova, and joining NATO is one of his points.\u201d Although Moldova isn\u2019t yet a member of NATO, it has cooperated with the Western military bloc, such as when it sent peacekeeping troops to Kosovo. Moldovan Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu attended a NATO summit in Bucharest last November, marking the first time that Chisinau sent a representative to a meeting of the bloc. At the time, Popescu reportedly said that joining NATO was out of the question because of the neutrality provision in Moldova\u2019s Constitution. By apparently changing that stance, Sandu is \u201cacting on the orders of overseas masters, against the interests of the country and the people, against the sovereignty, territorial integrity of Moldova,\u201d Dodon said. \u201cOur citizens want to maintain neutrality and peace, as evidenced by the results of numerous public opinion polls, and they will never agree to become cannon fodder for NATO in the fight against Russia.\u201d Moscow has blamed NATO\u2019s eastward expansion \u2013 contrary to promises made after the Cold War ended in 1991 \u2013 for undermining Russia\u2019s security interests, helping to trigger the current conflict.\n\nWill it be?\n\u2022 The Nord Stream Pipeline Could Be Repaired Within A Year (OP)\n\nThe Nord Stream pipeline can be repaired within a year, but it\u2019s unclear whether Germany would want to receive Russian natural gas at all, said Klaus-Dieter Maubach, the outgoing CEO at German energy giant Uniper, which was Russia\u2019s top gas customer before Moscow cut off supply via Nord Stream. \u201cThe first question that needs answering: what\u2019s the political will on a European level and in Berlin to bring Russian gas to Germany?\u201d Maubach said at the annual Handelsblatt Energy summit on Tuesday, as carried by Reuters. Last summer, the German government bailed out Uniper as losses at the German company continued to mount after Russia slashed gas deliveries via Nord Stream in June, before cutting off supply in early September. At the end of December, it was Uniper, the operator of the Wilhelmshaven import terminal, that welcomed the first tanker carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the newly opened LNG terminal, with the cargo arriving from the Calcasieu Pass export facility in the United States. Meanwhile, the investigation into the Nord Stream explosions at the end of September continues amid accusations from Russia that some Western intelligence services are \u201chiding something.\u201d Sweden\u2019s refusal to share information about the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines is \u201cpuzzling,\u201d and withholding the results of the investigation means that \u201cSwedish authorities are hiding something,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said last week. Traces of explosives were found near the sites of the explosions at the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea, Sweden said in November, noting that the incident is \u201cgross sabotage.\u201d Nord Stream 2 was never put into operation after Germany axed the certification process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia, for its part, shut down Nord Stream 1 indefinitely in early September, claiming an inability to repair gas turbines because of the Western sanctions.\n\n\u201c..if any witness or forensic evidence shows that Biden came into contact with any of these documents over the last 10 years, this dubious defense will take on a far more sinister appearance..\u201d\n\nIn 1977, as senator from Delaware, Biden torpedoed President Jimmy Carter\u2019s nominee for CIA director over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. As with the current scandal, Ted Sorensen was accused of having the documents for work on a book. The motive did not matter. Sen. Biden expressed his signature revulsion at the very thought of the possession. There was no evidence of ill intent, but Biden insisted that was not the issue. Biden argued that Sorensen could still be prosecuted under the Espionage Act and insisted the \u201creal issue\u201d during Sorensen\u2019s confirmation hearing was \u201cwhether Mr. Sorensen intentionally took advantage of ambiguities in the law, or carelessly ignored the law.\u201d After all, Biden continued, \u201cIf he did so, can he now bring the activities of the intelligence community within the strict limits of the law? We will expect that in the future of intelligence agencies. If that is to be the case, then we must hold the director \u2013 DCI \u2013 accountable as well.\u201d Notably, some of the recently discovered classified documents may have been from Biden\u2019s time as a senator \u2014 over ten years ago. I have previously noted that Biden \u201chas always been better at expressing revulsion than responsibility.\u201d When it came to Sorensen, Biden could not imagine a rationalization for a nominee to excuse such mishandling of classified material, but as a president, \u201cthere is no there there.\u201d Biden has continued to make the case against himself with remarkable determination. His defense that some documents were housed in his \u201clocked garage with my Corvette\u201d may go down as one of the most imbecilic statements in modern political history. He then followed up with his \u201cno regrets\u201d comments (and his assurance of \u201cno there there\u201d) just before more classified documents were found \u201cthere.\u201d While special counsel do not mind defendants making fools of themselves, they do not want to join them in such public spectacles. In this investigation, the Biden defense is looking increasingly implausible in his claim of no knowledge or responsibility. Indeed, if any witness or forensic evidence shows that Biden came into contact with any of these documents over the last 10 years, this dubious defense will take on a far more sinister appearance. It would establish not just intent and knowledge, but an effort to deceive the public and prosecutors. Yet, even after the latest batch was found, Biden and allies like Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., are continuing to maintain that \u201cthere is no there there.\u201d These continuing denials now border on willful blindness and the public reaction is likely to echo the president\u2019s favorite tagline: \u201cCome on, man.\u201d\n\n\u201c..Hunter Biden, is like the ambitious-but-dull son who wants to inherit the family business but always screws up..\u201d\n\nWatching HBO\u2019s \u201cthe Sopranos\u201d can really help you understand the Biden family. Between Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop scandal, and the Bidens\u2019 various shady private-equity schemes with foreign fraudsters, it\u2019s not too hard to make the analogy. President Joe Biden is clearly the head of a family. He has repeatedly exploited his public offices to make money. His son, Hunter Biden, is like the ambitious-but-dull son who wants to inherit the family business but always screws up. Some of what the Bidens have done is clearly inappropriate. Even more of what they have done is an abuse of public office. Most of what they have done is simply secret. The best example of Bidens\u2019 manipulation of the system for profit surrounds the Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania. The center has given the Bidens remarkable access to Chinese Communist Party money. According to reports in the New York Post, the university, \u201craked in a total of $54.6 million from 2014 through June 2019 in donations from China, including $23.1 million in anonymous gifts starting in 2016.\u201d As the paper reported, about $15.8 in anonymous Chinese gifts came after the Biden Center was announced in 2017. As soon as Biden left the White House as vice president, he was tapped to lead the center and given a professorship. Shortly after the center fully opened, another $14.5 million in anonymous Chinese gifts were delivered in May 2018. In another report about this flood of money, The Free Beacon said $61 million in Chinese donations went to the university from 2017 to 2020. The numbers vary because there is virtually no public accountability or transparency about the money trail. It\u2019s a given that Chinese sources aren\u2019t going to share any information. And the University of Pennsylvania is simply refusing to obey the law and report the foreign donations. I worked with the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Education on this for several years, and we simply could not get the University of Pennsylvania to open its books and explain where all the Chinese money was coming from. Consider that now-Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the manager of the Penn Biden Center. Several other Biden team members were paid by the University of Pennsylvania in the period between Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidency and presidency. Meanwhile, in apparent appreciation for setting him up at the center, Joe Biden appointed former University President Amy Gutmann to be U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Similarly, David Cohen, the former chairman of the university\u2019s board of trustees, is now the U.S. Ambassador to Canada.\n\nStonewalled by the White House, House investigators are turning their attention to the Secret Service in hopes of finding records showing who had access to the five tranches of classified records found in President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware home and Washington think tank office. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) said Sunday the latest discovery of documents by the FBI during a search Friday had escalated the scandal from simply a question of incompetence, especially since the home where many of the documents were found was frequented by Hunter Biden as he pursued significant business deals with communist China. \u201cThis has all the pattern of an influence peddling scheme, and it also has the makings of a potential coverup,\u201d Comer told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s a lot of connections with the CCP directly to both Hunter Biden, Hunter Biden\u2019s Uncle Jim and Joe Biden.\u201d The Biden administration has refused to provide any information about the classified documents, citing last week an ongoing special counsel probe into the discoveries of five tranches of classified documents at the Wilmington, Del., family home and the Penn Biden Center in Washington since Nov. 2. Comer said Sunday the distribution of the documents at multiple locations raised concerns. \u201cDoes anyone believe that those classified documents, when they left the vice president\u2019s office, they just took them to multiple locations all over the East Coast?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt has the appearance that someone would have taken them and moved them around. I mean, this is very concerning.\u201d Comer said his committee would be sending letters to the Secret Service on Monday for any records the presidential security agency has about who visited either location. \u201cHopefully, the Secret Service is going to work with us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re requesting tomorrow formally any type of correspondence, any type of emails, any type of documentation that would help us determine who actually had access to those documents. And hopefully the Secret Service will work with us despite the fact that this White House is not.\u201d\n\n\u201c..oil\u2019s share of energy production in the United States will only fall 8 percent in the next two decades, from 31 to 23 percent\u2026\u201d\n\nAt long last, the Biden administration is admitting what experts have always known: reckless energy policies have disastrous consequences. This time, the Department of Energy quietly released a report highlighting the positive economic benefits of developing the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada, an energy project canceled by President Biden in the hours following his inauguration. But the DOE\u2019s report is a proverbial day late and a dollar short. The cancelation of the Keystone XL pipeline has already cost the United States thousands of jobs and billions in economic growth while families suffer under the weight of record high energy prices. It\u2019s time for lawmakers to make American energy independence a top priority. Released without a formal announcement, the DOE\u2019s report points out that the pipeline would have created between 16,149 and 59,000 jobs and would have had an economic benefit of between $3.4 and 9.6 billion. That\u2019s no small impact. Yet with one stroke of his pen, Biden slashed the project and instead focused his efforts on costly \u201cgreen energy\u201d goals. As a result of his executive action, 11,000 pipeline workers were promptly laid off and told to \u201cgo to work to make solar panels\u201d instead. But Biden\u2019s green energy efforts are bound to backfire sooner rather than later. That\u2019s because today, more than 70 percent of the energy produced and consumed in America comes from oil, gas and coal. That\u2019s not likely to substantially change anytime soon. In fact, the International Energy Agency predicts that oil\u2019s share of energy production in the United States will only fall 8 percent in the next two decades, from 31 to 23 percent. And that\u2019s assuming a sustained commitment to green energy policies. The forecast spells bad news for the Biden White House. At his political peril, Biden ignores the lessons of Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush, who both lost elections due to spiked oil prices and accompanying recessions. Two years into sowing its Green New Deal policies, the administration is reaping a bitter harvest. Due to Biden\u2019s folly, oil, natural gas and electricity prices have more than doubled in just a single year. Meanwhile, more than 28 percent of Americans abstained from purchasing food or medicine to pay an energy bill in 2021. And now, the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act includes wind and solar spending that will cost Americans $369 billion.\n\n\u201cKlaus Schwab will stay in office until he dies..\u201d\n\u2022 \u2018Succession\u2019 Has Nothing On Davos: Elite Conclave Mulls Next Leader (Pol.eu)\n\nIt\u2019s the political race everyone is afraid to talk about. For 52 years the World Economic Forum has been synonymous with its founder and executive chair Klaus Schwab, whose humble manner belies what many who know him describe as great ambition and boundless energy, even into his mid-80s. Schwab has grown WEF\u2019s $6,000 startup capital in 1971 into a $390 million a year business, turning a once sleepy organization into the think tank world\u2019s FIFA. Today, WEF\u2019s annual meeting attracts more billionaires and CEOs than any other event on earth, and more political leaders than any gathering outside the United Nations General Assembly. So what (and who) comes after Klaus Schwab? Schwab turns 85 in March, and it\u2019s an open question whether he will pass the torch at all. Rupert Murdoch hasn\u2019t. Warren Buffet hasn\u2019t. In an era of active aging, why should Schwab? POLITICO spoke to 29 WEF corporate strategic partners, current and former WEF staffers, and members of the forum\u2019s committees and communities. They all agree: Schwab tightly controls the succession discussion. Even those who know Schwab well profess little knowledge of his plans. Forum staffers have become used to Schwab putting a high-profile political figure in the frame for succession, only to see the idea disappear before it becomes a plan. Schwab has been reluctant to talk about succession, and has consistently refused to discuss a timetable. Five of the people POLITICO spoke to said they suspect he will stay in the job until he dies, like the monarchs and popes his critics say he styles himself after. WEF insiders are typically unwilling to talk on-the-record about the organization\u2019s post-Schwab future. All 29 people told POLITICO they feared being barred from WEF events, while others said even speaking anonymously could get them fired. WEF is registered as a non-profit, but it\u2019s also a multi-generation family business. Schwab\u2019s children Nicole and Olivier hold high-ranking positions in the organization, and his wife Hilde presides over a foundation and awards ceremony in Davos. WEF\u2019s governing statutes give family members rights to board seats. In 2017 Schwab brought in B\u00f8rge Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister, to serve as WEF\u2019s president, while Schwab himself remained executive chair. If some outsiders expected the then 79-year-old to ease into the shadows, they were wrong: Per WEF\u2019s website, the organization\u2019s 800-strong staff is still \u201cled by Founder and Executive Chairman Professor Klaus Schwab.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d amassed $49 million at the world box office and catapulted Al into the top ranks of climate hysterics, and he\u2019s never looked back..\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President and 2000 presidential election loser Al Gore has spent his post-political career warning anyone who will listen that the earth is in its death throes due to global warming (now called climate change because somehow that\u2019s better). His 2006 documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d amassed $49 million at the world box office and catapulted Al into the top ranks of climate hysterics, and he\u2019s never looked back, constantly jetting to meetings around the world to preach his truth. This week he\u2019s at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, because of course he is. Is he doing this because he truly believes what he\u2019s saying, or because he cares so very much about you? While we can\u2019t read his mind, one thing we do know for sure: climate change has been very, very good to Al Gore. Though he was worth approximately $1.7 million at the end of his vice presidency, he has now amassed an estimated $330 million fortune, owns houses in Virginia, California, and Tennessee, and receives a cool $2 million a month for a figurehead position at the Generation Investment Management green energy fund he founded with former Goldman Sachs Managing Director David W. Blood. There are only two conclusions I can come to upon learning this news\u20141) I should have been a climate activist. 2) Hunter Biden has nothing on this guy. If he\u2019s so concerned about rising seas, why would Gore buy a huge oceanview mansion in flood-prone Montecito? One might ask the same question of former president Barack Obama, who dropped $12 million for a waterfront view on the island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Gore\u2019s other property holdings are pretty sweet, too, according to Daily Mail:\u201dGore\u2019s family has owned farming land in his native Tennessee for generations, while his mansion in Nashville is valued at $7.5 million, his waterfront villa in Montecito, where he counts Oprah as a neighbor [and don\u2019t forget Prince Harry], is worth $13 million, his Virginia home is worth around $3 million as is his apartment in the St. Regis building in San Francisco.\u201d Where did he get all this money? He has a stake in the aforementioned $36 billion Generation Investment Management fund, around $80 million worth of stock in companies such as Apple and Google, and a salary from Apple as a compensation committee member. He receives $200,000 a pop per public speaking engagement and also advises companies on \u201cgoing green\u201d for undisclosed (but presumably huge) fees.\n\u2022 Trump and DeSantis Both Leading Biden In Hypothetical 2024 Matchup (JTN)\n\nWall Street Journal editorial board member Allysia Finley has taken a flamethrower to vaccine makers over their \u201cdeceptive\u201d campaign for bivalent Covid boosters, and slams several federal agencies for taking \u201cthe unprecedented step of ordering vaccine makers to produce them and recommending them without data supporting their safety or efficacy.\u201d \u201cYou might have heard a radio advertisement warning that if you\u2019ve had Covid, you could get it again and experience even worse symptoms. The message, sponsored by the Health and Human Services Department, claims that updated bivalent vaccines will improve your protection. This is deceptive advertising. But the public-health establishment\u2019s praise for the bivalent shots shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. -WSJ\u201d The narrative behind the campaign was simple; mRNA Covid shots could simply be \u2018tweaked\u2019 to to target new variants \u2013 in this case, the jabs were claimed to confer protection against BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron variants, along with the original Wuhan strain. To call this wishful thinking would be extremely generous. As Finley writes, three scientific problems have arisen. 1/ The virus is mutating much faster than vaccines can be updated. 2/ Vaccines have \u2018hard wired\u2019 our immune systems to respond to the original Wuhan strain, \u201cso we churn out fewer antibodies that neutralize variants targeted by updated vaccines.\u201d 3/ Antibody protection wanes after just a few months. Finley has brought receipts too\u2026 Two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine this month showed that bivalent boosters increase neutralizing antibodies against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, but not significantly more than the original boosters. In one study, antibody levels after the bivalent boosters were 11 times as high against the Wuhan variant as BA.5. The authors posit that immune imprinting \u201cmay pose a greater challenge than is currently appreciated for inducing robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants.\u201d This isn\u2019t unique to Covid or mRNA vaccines, though boosters may amplify the effect.
