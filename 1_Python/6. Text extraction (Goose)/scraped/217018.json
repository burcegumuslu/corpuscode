Antimicrobial preservatives include benzoates, sorbates, propionates, nitrates and nitrites.\n\u2022 Antioxidants \u2013 prevent discoloration and slow air oxidation of fats and lipids (which leads to rancidity). Antioxidant preservatives include sulfites, BHA, BHT, and vitamin C and E.\n\u2022 Chelating agents \u2013 these help to bind metals (like copper and iron) to prevent food from oxidizing and speeding up spoilage. EDTA, polyphosphates and citric acid are examples of chelating agents.\n\nThere are far too many artificial preservatives to cover in detail throughout this Challenge, so we\u2019ll stick to those that are the most prevalent and dangerous to human health.\n\nEliminate Preservatives From Your Diet for Good with a Naturally Savvy Get Healthy Challenge\n\nBHA and BHT fall into the \u2018antioxidant\u2019 category of food preservatives.\n\nBHA is added to foods containing fats to prevent them from becoming rancid. It is found in cereals, dehydrated potatoes, chewing gum, baked goods, snack foods, beer, and animal feed.\n\nA similar compound, BHT also slows the oxidation of fats. It, too, is used to preserve a food\u2019s odor, color, and flavor. Many packaging materials, including cereal packaging, contain BHT \u2018to preserve freshness\u2019. It is also added to shortening and other foods containing fats and oils.\n\nResearch suggests that both BHA and BHT may be carcinogens and endocrine disrupters because they mimic the hormonal actions of estrogen. The World Health Organization, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program consider BHA a possible carcinogen. BHA and BHT have been known to affect the nervous system and cause behavioral problems in children. Read ingredient labels and avoid foods containing one or both of these chemicals.\n\nRead more about BHT in your kid's breakfast cereal\n\nSulfites are inorganic salts that have antioxidant and preservative properties. They are added to foods for various reasons. They slow the spoiling of food by bacteria and reduce the rate at which fruit and vegetables brown. They inhibit the growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of wine. Sometimes, sulfites are used as dough conditioners in frozen pie and pizza crusts and they may be used as bleaching agents in some foods.\n\nSulfites are one of the top 10 most common food allergens. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that 1 out of every 100 people has some type of sensitivity to sulfites. Although sulfites do not cause a true allergic reaction, sulfite-sensitive people may experience similar reactions as those with food allergies. People with asthma are most at risk of sulfite sensitivity and other reactions to sulfites. The FDA estimates that 5 percent of those with asthma are allergic to sulfites.\n\nSymptoms of sulfite intolerance can occur within 15-30 minutes following oral exposure.\n\u2022 Swelling of the eyes, face, lips, throat and tongue\n\nThe FDA requires that any food with a sulfite concentration of more than 10 parts per million (ppm) must be declared on the label. Sulfites have caused death in those severely allergic, even at doses as little as 20 ppm. Since it takes the body at least 24 hours to detoxify sulfites, ingesting multiple sulfite-containing foods throughout the day can have a cumulative effect.\n\nFoods with the highest levels of sulfites (more than 100 ppm) include:\n\nThose with severe sulfite allergies must strictly avoid these foods.\n\nFoods with between 50 to 99 ppm of sulfites include:\n\nYou will likely find sulfites on ingredient lists of salad dressings, jams, pickles, shredded coconut, processed cheese, fresh or frozen shrimp or lobster, and many more foods; you won\u2019t, however, find sulfites on foods and beverages containing high fructose corn syrup. Sulfites are used to make high-fructose corn syrup, and anything containing this sweetener, such as a soda, may cause a reaction in sensitive individuals.\n\nAdding insult to injury, sulfites destroy thiamine (vitamin B ) and may destroy folic acid (vitamin B ) in the foods to which they\u2019re added.\n\nSodium nitrate is a salt added to hot dogs, bacon, ham, salami, beef jerky, pepperoni, sausages and lunchmeats.\n\nThere are two reasons sodium nitrate is added to cured meats: Firstly, it inhibits the development of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium which causes botulism, a paralytic illness that can lead to respiratory failure. Unlike most microbes, the botulism bacteria require an oxygen-free environment to live and can contaminate canned or vacuum-packed foods, garlic stored in oil and improperly cured meats.\n\nSecondly, sodium nitrate is responsible for the pink or red color that gives cured meats the impression that the meat is \u2018fresh\u2019 as well as the characteristic flavor of cold cuts.\n\nSodium nitrate is dyed pink to differentiate it from sodium chloride (table salt), particularly since it\u2019s much more toxic. If sodium nitrate is ingested, as little as 1/6 of an ounce can be fatal!\n\nNitrate converts to nitrite, which possesses the antimicrobial properties. Under certain conditions, nitrites can produce carcinogenic chemical compounds called nitrosamines. Those conditions include strong acidity \u2013 as in stomach acid, or cooking with high temperatures, for example, frying, barbecuing, or sizzling pepperoni on a pizza in the oven.\n\nFood labels do not specify the exact amount, but most foods containing sodium nitrate contain between 0.00002 and 0.004 percent.\n\nNitrates are linked to many various of cancer, and also to heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s Disease.\n\nRead more about bacon and sodium nitrite (nitrates)\n\nThis preservative is used to prolong shelf life by preventing mold, fungi and yeast growth. It is considered to be safe for human consumption, but has been linked to various side effects, including diarrhea and asthma.\n\nPotassium sorbate is found in many dairy products, including cheese, yogurt, margarines, mayonnaise and sour cream, as well as in some dried fruit, fermented foods, including wine (in the form of sorbic acid) and baked goods. It is also found in a variety of body care products.\n\nPotassium sorbate has been known to cause allergic reactions, including:\n\nSymptoms typically begin within 2 hours of ingesting the preservative.\n\nThis widely used antimicrobial salt is found in soda, vinegar, margarine, fruit drinks, pickles, jelly and jam, wine and more.\n\nA more significant issue, however, is the combination of sodium benzoate and acids in foods and beverages. When acids, such as citric acid ascorbic acid (vitamin C) are combined with sodium or potassium benzoate, they form benzene, a cancer-causing chemical associated with leukemia and other blood cancers.\n\nRead more about why sodium benzoate is so scary\n\nPolysorbates are a group of emulsifiers made from corn, palm oil and petroleum. They are used in many frozen desserts such as ice cream, in baked goods and snacks, including Twinkies, and may even be found in salad dressing.\n\nThough toxicity is low, the thickening agents have been known to cause allergic reactions.\n\nVery little research has been done on Polysorbate 80, even though it\u2019s used in many foods, body care products and medications, including vaccines. One study, however, found it stimulated estrogen production and caused infertility in female rats. One case of anaphylaxia (as a result of polysorbate 80 in a vaccine) has been documented. Additionally, a 2010 study found that it can aggravate Crohn\u2019s Disease.\n\nThe antioxidant TBHQ, tertiary butylhydroquinone, is a petroleum-based food additive used to increase the shelf life of products and prevent the rancidity of fats. It is used to preserve unsaturated vegetable oils, animal fats, and frozen fish, and is found in some chocolates. It is also used in perfume, varnish, lacquer, and resins.\n\nThe FDA limits the amount of TBHQ that can be used in a food to 0.02 percent. As little as 1 gram has been associated with nausea, vomiting, symptoms of ADD, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and it is a suspected endocrine disruptor. It has also been associated with asthma, dermatitis and rhinitis.\n\n[Editor's Note: If you want to eliminate unhealthy ingredients and chemical additives from your diet for good, click here to sign up for a Naturally Savvy Get Healthy Challenge.]", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "What are Preservatives? | Naturally Savvy", "description": "It\u2019s estimated that about 10,000 chemicals are added to our food supply, including artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners and more.
