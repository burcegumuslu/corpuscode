Two shots of the vaccine are needed, spaced three or four weeks apart depending on whether you get the Pfizer-BioNTech product or the Moderna one.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most commonly reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccination are pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, joint pain and swollen regional lymph nodes.\n\nYou should be able to reduce any pain or discomfort in the affected arm by applying a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area and by using the arm normally. If you find that the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours, contact your healthcare provider. Do the same if you have other side effects that worry you or don\u2019t seem to be going away after a few days.\n\nBe aware that you won\u2019t be fully protected from COVID-19 until a week or two after you\u2019ve received your second shot. In the meantime, be sure to take precautions \u2013 wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you\u2019re around others, stay at least six feet away from others, avoid crowds and wash your hands often. It is best to continue masking and social distancing even after you are immunized.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been infected by COVID-19 and recovered, you may be immune to reinfection for at least 90 days, although we don\u2019t yet know how long natural protection lasts.\n\nThe vaccine itself won\u2019t cost you anything, although your health care provider may charge an administration fee for giving the shot, and that cost can be reimbursed by your insurance company or, for the uninsured, by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nMy advice: Don\u2019t worry about temporary side effects or cost. Get the shot!\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u201cWhat to Expect after Getting a Covid 19 Vaccine,\u201d January 11, 2021", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects? | Disease & Disorders | Andrew Weil, M.D.", "description": "Not everyone who receives the vaccine develops any side effects.
