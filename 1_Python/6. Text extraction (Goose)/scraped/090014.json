A new vaccine developed by the University of Oxford has been shown to trigger an immune response in humans.\n\nThe first trials for the new vaccine involved 1,077 people and over 90% of them showed positive results. The vaccine triggered the production of both antibodies and T-cells capable of fighting off the novel coronavirus which was the goal. The UK has already ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine provided that further human trials continue to show positive results.\n\nWhat are T-cells and antibodies?\n\nThey are small proteins made by our immune system to specifically stick to the surface of viruses and neutralize them.\n\nAntibodies aren\u2019t \u201cone size fits all\u201d, however, and don\u2019t work against any and all viruses. Our immune systems need to know what kind of virus they are dealing with and what type of antibodies they should build.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely the purpose of all vaccines \u2013 to \u201cteach\u201d our immune systems what they might have to deal with and help them prepare for it.\n\nThis is where T-cells come in. These are a specialized type of white blood cells that help coordinate our immune system and \u201cspot\u201d viruses. Without T-cells, no amount of antibodies can be enough to deal with a virus.\n\nThat\u2019s why the production of both T-cells and antibodies is the goal of any vaccine. And both were shown to be effective by this new Oxford vaccine. The T-cell levels of the test subjects were shown to peak ~14 days after vaccination and the levels of antibodies \u2013 ~28 days after vaccination.\n\nProfessor Andrew Polland from the Oxford research group had this to say about the results \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased with the results published today as we\u2019re seeing both neutralizing antibodies and T-cells. They\u2019re extremely promising and we believe the type of response that may be associated with protection. But the key question everyone wants to know is does the vaccine work, does it offer protection\u2026 and we\u2019re in a waiting game.\u201d\n\nOf the 1,077 participants, 90% showed production of antibodies and T-cells after just one vaccination, and the others \u2013 after a second vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the level needed for protection, but we can maximize responses with a second dose,\u201d Professor Pollard added.\n\nHow was the vaccine made?\n\nThe vaccine called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was created by genetically re-engineering the virus responsible for the common cold in chimpanzees. The reason it was so suitable for the job is that common cold viruses are also types of coronavirus, different from but similar to Covid-19.\n\nStill, the virus was heavily modified both so it can resemble the novel coronavirus and so it doesn\u2019t cause infections. This was done by transferring the genetic instructions for the virus\u2019s \u201cspike protein\u201d which Covid-19 uses to invade cells into the vaccine. This way, the vaccine \u201clooks like\u201d the novel coronavirus to our immune system and the latter can learn how to fight it.\n\nAre there any side effects?\n\nSo far, only mild ones. Around 17% of patients developed a mild fever and over 60% \u2013 a headache. There weren\u2019t any other side-effects from the initial trials and all of these were handled easily with paracetamol.\n\nProfessor Sarah Gilbert from the Oxford research group said that \u201cThere is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the Covid-19 pandemic, but these early results hold promise.\u201d\n\nThere are still more trials to be done of course. 1,077 participants may be enough to show promise but are not enough to guarantee neither effectiveness nor safety.\n\nThe next stage of the trials is set to include over 10,000 people in the UK. After that, further trials will be expanded to countries outside of the UK with potentially 30,000 participants from the U.S., 5,000 from Brazil, and 2,000 from South Africa.\n\nIf treatment options for Covid-19 are discovered in time, there may also be \u201cchallenge trials\u201d which include infecting vaccinated people with the coronavirus.\n\nWhen will the vaccine be available?\n\nAs with other in-development vaccines in similar stages, the vaccine may be ready by the end of the year but it still wouldn\u2019t be mass-produced at that point. Health and care workers will be the first to receive any finalized vaccine due to the nature of their work. After that, mass production and distribution to the rest of the population should be available in early 2021 if all goes well.\n\nAs UK prime minister Boris Johnson said \u201cObviously I\u2019m hopeful, I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed, but to say I\u2019m 100% confident we\u2019ll get a vaccine this year, or indeed next year, is, alas, just an exaggeration. We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nStill, this is amazing progress. As of today, there are 160+ Covid-19 vaccines being developed around the world but only a few of them are going into wider testing. This graph from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows clearly how 140 of those ~160 in-development vaccines are still in pre-trials stages. Oxford\u2019s ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has joined the \u201celite\u201d company of just a few vaccines that have so far shown truly promising results.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that vaccine research is not a one-winner race. There likely won\u2019t be just the \u201cone best\u201d vaccine for Covid-19 as the virus has already started mutating. Instead, we\u2019ll likely need multiple vaccines for multiple strains of the virus. Or, as Kate Bingham, the chairwoman of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, explained it:\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is identifying the most promising vaccines across the different categories, or different types of vaccine, so that we can be sure that we do have a vaccine in case one of those actually proves to be both safe and effective. It\u2019s unlikely to be a single vaccine for everybody. We may well need different vaccines for different groups of people.\u201d", "opengraph": {"description": "- While the Covid-19 pandemic doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down neither are the scientists working hard on developing vaccines and cures.
