Kennedy, Jr. thanked the street artist for \"striking a blow\u201d for freedom.\n\n\"Thanks to Lushsux for striking this blow for freedom Down Under.\n\n\"Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News and Vaccine empire have aligned with Bill Gates\u2019s international health agency cartel to make Australia the proving grounds for their 'Great Reset;' the global devolution from democracy to medical fascism,\u201d continued Kennedy, Jr.\n\n\"Citing biosecurity, Australian technocrats have imposed harsh censorship, wall to wall surveillance, the digitalization of currency and rigid social controls including oppressive lockdowns and compulsory masking-all without notice and comment rule making, public hearings, debate or any of the traditional safeguards of participatory democracy.\n\n\"To maintain control and obedience, dictatorial regimes use fear to justify the obliteration of culture, self expression and personal freedoms,\" JFK's nephew continued.\n\n\"Authoritarian theocracies, commonly for example, force women to wear hoods, masks or burkhas to trample self expression and signify submission and obedience.\n\n\"The emerging biosecurity states are compelling the burkazation of entire populations.\n\n\"The mask is persistent reminder of the fear of contagion and a signal of obedience and conformity.\n\n\"Because the bio security oppression begins with this eradication of facial expression, art music and humor are now critical revolutionary acts.\u201d\n\nAs Neon Nettle previously reported, similar scenes were also witnessed in Germany last month, when citizens flooded the streets of Berlin in their tens of thousands to protest against Gates and Big Pharma.\n\nBill Gates and his wife Melinda have come under mounting scrutiny over recent months due to their increasing involvement in world health issues, most notably, their interest in the COVID-19 pandemic and the race for a vaccine.\n\nIn late August, the massive rally in Germany saw huge crowds demanding humanity wakes up and rejects Bill Gates, who protesters slammed as a self-styled \"world health dictator.\"\n\nDemonstrators also blasted the pharmaceutical industry, accusing drug companies of driving the world toward \"global totalitarianism\" and \"slavery.\"\n\n\"Governments love pandemics,\" Kennedy, Jr. said at the German rally.\n\n\"It\u2019s a mystery to me that all of these big important people like Bill Gates and Tony Fauci have been planning and thinking about this pandemic for decades,\" Kennedy Jr. continued.\n\n\"And yet, now that it\u2019s here, they don\u2019t seem to know what they are talking about.\n\n\"They are making it up as they go along.\n\n\"They are inventing numbers,\" he said.\n\n[RELATED] Petition to Investigate Bill Gates for 'Crimes Against Humanity' Goes Viral", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/bill-gates-mural-protesters-arrest-chant-117920.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Protesters Demand Bill Gates' Arrest as Huge Anti-Gates Mural Emerges in Melbourne", "description": "Anti-vaccine street art depicts smiling Bill Gates holding a syringe - Crowds of Australians have been taking to the streets and demanding that billionaire Bill Gates i... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Protest", "Bill Gates"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The crowd has broken into chants of \"arrest Bill Gates\" at the anti-lockdown protest at Parliament House in Melbourne <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theage?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theage</a>.
