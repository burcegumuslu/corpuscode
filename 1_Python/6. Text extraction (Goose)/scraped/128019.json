Despite the fact that only women suffer from cancers of the ovary, womb and cervix, the NHS management removed any mention of them in an attempt at politically correct language.\n\nThe original version of NHS\u2019 web page for ovarian cancer contained this passage: \u201cOvarian cancer, or cancer of the ovaries, is one of the most common types of cancer in women. Ovarian cancer mainly affects women who have been through menopause, usually over the age of 50, but it can sometimes affect younger women.\u201d\n\nHowever, a stealthily-done update in January 2022 dropped the two-sentence passage. It was instead replaced with this line: \u201cAnyone with ovaries can get ovarian cancer, but it mostly affects those over 50.\u201d\n\nThe page for womb cancer was also subjected to the same changes. Its original version opened with: \u201cCancer of the womb \u2013 uterine or endometrial cancer \u2013 is a common cancer that affects the female reproductive system. It\u2019s more common in women who have been through menopause.\u201d The opening statement was excised from the site in October 2021, with no mention of women.\n\n\u201cCervical cancer develops in a woman\u2019s cervix \u2013 the entrance to the womb from the vagina. It mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45,\u201d stated the NHS web page for the condition. However, a subsequent revision removed the aforementioned passage entirely. Interestingly, the latest version of the NHS page for cervical cancer features a diagram of the female reproductive system even though no mention of \u201cwomen\u201d is made.\n\nThe NHS defended its decision to remove the words \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d in the web pages about the three cancers, saying that it seeks to make the resources \u201cas helpful as possible to everyone who needs them.\u201d\n\nWriting for LifeSiteNews, pro-life activist Jonathon Von Maren criticized the NHS\u2019 move. \u201cThese changes are just the latest example of the ongoing colonization of the NHS by the transgender movement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for a man to give birth or contract cervical cancer. But none of that matters: Only the feelings of trans activists matter now.\u201d\n\nVon Maren was not alone in his criticism of the British health system\u2019s removal of the word \u201cwomen\u201d in its resources. Coventry University professor Jenny Gamble, an expert in midwifery, warned that the change in language risked women missing out on important health information.\n\n\u201cThe trend to avoid using the terms \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019 is unhelpful. It is a well-established principle of communication that the sex of individuals should be made visible when relevant and should not be made visible when not. This ensures that sex-related needs and issues are not overlooked,\u201d she told the Mail.\n\nIt appears the trend to erase any mention of women for fear of offending the transgender sector is not only found across the pond. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drew flak for using the purportedly inclusive term \u201cpregnant people\u201d instead of \u201cpregnant women.\u201d (Related: CDC director draws flak for calling on \u201cpregnant people\u201d to get vaccinated, refusing to admit only WOMEN can be pregnant.)\n\nThe director of the public health agency used the phrase in a tweet that called for people to get the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. \u201cThe rise in cases, vaccine hesitancy and the increased risk of severe illness for pregnant people make vaccination against COVID-19 more urgent than ever,\u201d her tweet said. Walensky used the supposedly gender-neutral term in a subsequent tweet.\n\nMany Twitter users, including two U.S. lawmakers, did not take too kindly to Walensky\u2019s use of the term.\n\nRep. Mary Miller (R-IL) said the CDC\u2019s use of \u201cleft-wing\u201d language makes the American public to lose \u201cfaith and trust in [its] objectivity.\u201d Meanwhile, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said the term \u201cpregnant people\u201d was \u201cerasing women,\u201d adding that \u201cthe recent movement to erase women is disturbing and has made its way into our bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nWatch this video about CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky\u2019s call for \u201cpregnant people\u201d to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis video is from the high impact Flix and more!!! channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nUK hospitals go \u201cfull woketard\u201d by now asking MEN if they are pregnant.\n\nUK equality commission: Transgenders CAN BE DENIED access to single-sex spaces.\n\nSAY WHAT?
