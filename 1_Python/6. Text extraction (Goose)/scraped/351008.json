But this time she didn\u2019t get away with it.\n\nWe\u2019ve got bad news and good news about the Covid vaccines for children. The bad news is they are even more deadly than anyone thought, but the good news is that more parents are waking up and protecting their children from the lethal jabs.\n\nAnd be aware, Joe Biden wants your guns. He and the Democrats in Congress particularly want to strip away your rights to own any semi-automatic firearms that can hold more than ten rounds. We\u2019ll update you on the status of a bill that would accomplish all that and more.\n\nWe have all these stories and more when the Worldview Report begins, right now!\n\nGood evening everyone and welcome to the Worldview Report. I\u2019m Brannon Howse.\n\nWe have a lot of news to get through tonight so let\u2019s get right to it.\n\nBreaking this week in the nation\u2019s capital, it looks like the globalist insiders who took full control of this country in January 2021 are finally going for the jugular in their long-coveted attempt to take down Donald Trump.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has opened a formal investigation into the former president for allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nIn other words, the exact crime that the Democrats committed, they are trying to pin on Trump.\n\nThe official newspaper of the Washington globalist elites, The Washington Post, reported that DOJ prosecutors are probing \u201cconversations with Trump, his lawyers, and others in his inner circle who sought to substitute Trump allies for certified electors from some states Joe Biden won.\u201d\n\nThe Post is building what amounts to a public narrative that gives cover for the prosecutors.\n\nThe newspaper further reports that:\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is investigating President Donald Trump\u2019s actions as part of its criminal probe of efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, according to four people familiar with the matter. Prosecutors who are questioning witnesses before a grand jury \u2014 including two top aides to Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 have asked in recent days about conversations with Trump, his lawyers, and others in his inner circle who sought to substitute Trump allies for certified electors from some states Joe Biden won, according to two people familiar with the matter. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nThe Post\u2019s unnamed sources also said that prosecutors have asked hours of detailed questions about meetings led by Trump in December 2020 and January 2021, as well as \u201chis pressure campaign on Pence to overturn the election; and what instructions Trump gave his lawyers and advisers about fake electors and sending electors back to the states.\u201d\n\nThe report added: \u201cSome of the questions focused directly on the extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the fake-elector effort led by his outside lawyers, including John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani, these people said.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Becker News, the partisan January 6 committee has utterly failed to show that former President Donald Trump was in any way responsible for the massive security failure that led to protesters overwhelming the Capitol building during the convening of the Electoral College.\n\nAnd anytime the corrupt Washington Post colludes with \u201cunnamed\u201d Washington sources to form a narrative, you know there is a wicked scheme afoot and very little, if any truth involved.\n\nThe UK Government has quietly confirmed that the Covid-19 vaccines are killing children at an unprecedented rate.\n\nAccording to The Expose, shocking figures contained in an official report reveal Covid-19 vaccinated children are 4423% or 45 times more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated children and 13,633 percent or 137 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than unvaccinated children.\n\nThese numbers were posted by the government just hours before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation in early July.\n\nA UK government agency, known as the Office for National Statistics, or ONS, recently published new data on deaths by vaccination status in England.\n\nThe latest dataset from the ONS is titled \u201cDeaths by Vaccination Status, England, 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022,\u201d and it can be accessed on the ONS website. These numbers are presented in such a way that attempts to shroud the level of death that is occurring.\n\nAccording to The Expose, \u201cThe ONS failed in their attempts to disguise the horrific mortality rates among Covid-19 vaccinated children because they still provide us with enough information for us to calculate the mortality rates ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Expose found that partly vaccinated children are 11 times or 966% more likely to die of Covid-19 than unvaccinated children, and triple vaccinated children are 137 times or 13,633.33% more likely to die of Covid-19 than unvaccinated children.\n\nAnd, according to the UK government\u2019s own official data, double vaccinated children are 1422% or 15 times more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated children, while triple vaccinated children are 4423% or 45 times more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated children.\n\nDespite the clarity of this data coming out about the so-called vaccines, Dr. Anthony Fauci is recommending Americans get yet another booster shot for the latest Covid variant. In an exclusive with The Hill on Monday, he said getting Big Pharma\u2019s newest jab is his \u201cbest guess\u201d at beating the new variant.\n\nScientists are not supposed to be in the business of \u201cguessing\u201d but that\u2019s all Fauci had to offer when asked about the best treatment against Covid. That in itself should send up red flags.\n\nHis comments come as the BA.5 is allegedly the most widespread variant causing infections. Fauci claimed the FDA will likely approve booster shots for this new variant by the fall. This comes despite studies showing natural immunity is longer lasting than vaccine immunity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility that you\u2019re going to have the evolution of another variant and hopefully if that occurs it will vary off from the BA.5 only slightly in the sense of being a sub-sub-lineage of it and not something entirely different.\u201d\n\nFauci has continued to defend COVID-19 vaccine mandates. He was asked why vaccines are still mandated in many places when he himself was quoted as saying that everyone would come into contact with COVID and most would contract it anyway. Fauci said vaccines, particularly boosters, prevent progression of the disease to hospitalization as the reason for the continued push.\n\nOf course, we know that\u2019s a lie based on the UK data and reports from doctors in the field who have told The Worldview Report that the overwhelming majority of patients being hospitalized with Covid right now are the vaccinated, not the unvaccinated.\n\nFauci, who tested positive for the virus twice, also praised the drug Paxlovid, which he said gave him a relatively mild disease.\n\nSince when do we praise a medication for giving us a disease, mild or otherwise?\n\nSome good news on killer Covid vaccines for children. Dr. Paul Alexander reports that parents are saying NO to the vaccine despite the rubber-stamp granting of emergency use by the corrupted FDA and CDC for children 6 months to 5 years old.\n\n19 million little kids are eligible for the shot, yet a mere fraction of parents have gone for it.\n\nAlexander reports that, as of July 20, approximately 544,000 American children under the age of 5 had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. This represents only 2.8% of the approximately 19 million children in this age group. At a similar point in their vaccine roll-out, more than 5.3 million children ages 5-11 (18.5%) had received their first dose.\n\nAlexander writes in a Substack post that most parents, \u201care shielding their kids from the danger; they sense it now! The COVID injection has failed, is highly ineffective and dangerous. The data is clear. No question. The vaccine itself and the antigen-specific vaccine-induced antibodies are non-neutralizing and not eliminating the virus. Not stopping infection or transmission and actually enhancing and facilitating infectiousness of the virus and infection in the vaccinated! The vaccinal antibodies are driving antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and driving infectious variant after variant to emerge. This could drive emergence of a variant that is highly infectious but also highly lethal, causing severe disease in the vaccinated.\u201d\n\nMass vaccinations will only cause this pandemic to keep going for 100 more years, Alexander said. And if children\u2019s innate immune systems\u2019 natural T cells cannot attain their functional capacity, then children will be at risk for auto-immune disease up to death.\n\nAs a result, Alexander writes, \u201cparents are giving their child a gift to resist these COVID injections. They must stave this off, for the innate immune system of children must be allowed to train in the prescribed window of opportunity.\u201d\n\nDaytime talk show \"The View\" and host Whoopi Goldberg tried to do a smear job on the conservative activist organization Turning Point USA on Monday after individuals presenting as Nazis showed up outside the group's Student Action Summit in Tampa, Florida, on Saturday.\n\nThe individuals that arrived outside the Tampa Bay Convention Center holding Nazi flags were driven away by conference attendees and Turning Point USA immediately disavowed the group in a press release.\n\n\"Yesterday, @TheView & Whoopi Goldberg smeared and lied about TPUSA regarding an incident where supposed \"nazis\" showed up outside of the Student Action Summit.\u201d\n\n\"While they were forced by their legal department to correct two of these misrepresentations live on air, Whoopi continued to insist that TPUSA somehow welcomed \"nazis\" into our event \u201cmetaphorically.\u201d\n\nHere she is trying her darndest to convince America that somehow \u201cnazis\u201d were a part of the Turning Point USA conference.\n\nShameful. But not at all surprising.\n\nTurning Point USA\u2019s lawyers ended up sending a letter to ABC News and The View demanding they cease and desist their slanderous remarks or else face a lawsuit. On Wednesday, The View issued a public apology for engaging in the smear campaign.\n\nA mother has gone public with a video on Tik Tok explaining to the world how her biological son came out as trans at the tender age of 3. Yes, you heard that right. Three years old and announcing you\u2019re transgender. Only in America.\n\nTake a look at her shocking comments.\n\nThere really are no words to describe how misguided and foolish some people can be when they have no spiritual anchor in their lives.\n\nNew York Democrat Congressman Jerry Nadler admitted that the whole purpose of a Democrat-led bill to ban \u201cassault weapons\u201d is to confiscate guns that are in \u201ccommon use\u201d by American citizens.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that these are particularly dangerous \u201cmilitary grade\u201d guns or \u201cweapons of war\u201d that don\u2019t belong in civilian hands.\n\nBut Nadler, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, came right out and denied that was the case when he stated that these weapons the Democrats want to ban are as common as apple pie in most American households.\n\nThe admission came during a House Judiciary Committee hearing last Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Congressman Dan Bishop of North Carolina asked House Democrats if they disputed the fact that the proposed legislation, H.R. 1808, titled \u201cAssault Weapons Ban of 2021,\u201d bans firearms in \u201ccommon use\u201d throughout the country.\n\nTake a look at this remarkable exchange between Bishop and Nadler.\n\nThere you have it, ladies and gentlemen, very well laid out there by Congressman Bishop. Weapons that are in common use are the very weapons that the Supreme Court has ruled in three different cases that Americans are entitled to own. The socialist Congressman Nadler fell right into Congressman Bishop\u2019s trap there and admitted those are the very weapons he and his Democrat colleagues want to ban.\n\nThe White House released an 11-minute speech Monday featuring a subdued, sleepy-eyed Joe Biden blinking normally at the beginning but near the end Biden\u2019s demeanor changed. He became more agitated and appeared bug-eyed, not blinking for long stretches.\n\nTucker Carlson recently reported a source told him Biden was fed pills by his staff, overseen by wife Jill, during the 2020 campaign that changed him from acting \u201clike a small child\u201d so he could perform at speeches and events.\n\nMonday\u2019s speech was recorded for the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives Conference held in Orlando. Biden was scheduled to speak in person as part of a two-event swing though Florida that was canceled after he became infected with COVID despite being quadruple vaccinated.\n\nWe\u2019ll show you the video and let you be the judge as to whether this is a man in full control of his faculties.\n\nTo correct the record, Biden was lying through his teeth. There were no cops killed that day at the hand of any January 6 protester. The only person murdered was an unarmed woman shot at point-blank range by the Capitol Police. Her name was Ashli Babbitt. That\u2019s a name that you won\u2019t find Biden\u2019s handlers fitting into any speech written for the doddering, mentally impaired president.\n\nJudicial Watch has revealed that the Biden administration continued to send billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers for months after the U.S. surrender. The Biden regime is also preventing an audit of exactly what that money was used for, reports The Gateway Pundit.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year now since Joe Biden and the U.S. Military surrendered to the Taliban terrorists. Joe Biden, General Mark Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin oversaw the great military giveaway in Afghanistan.\n\nAs part of the surrender, Biden armed the Taliban with nearly $85 billion in U.S. weapons and left thousands of Americans stranded in the country to fend for themselves.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon have never admitted to how many billions of dollars worth of weapons they left behind for the Taliban.\n\nThe White House announced Tuesday that the Department of Energy will be issuing a notice to sell off another 20 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as part of the Biden administration's effort to bring gas prices down.\n\nThis makes the fifth such sale that Biden has authorized from the nation\u2019s strategic reserves. The White House continued to blame \u201cdisruptions posed by Russia\u2019s invasion\u201d for the high prices while claiming that the Biden administration's actions are making a tremendous difference.\n\n\"In fact, the Department of the Treasury estimates that as a result of these drawdowns both domestically and internationally, the price at the pump for Americans is up to about 40 cents per gallon lower than it otherwise would have been,\" the White House said in its announcement.\n\nWhile gas prices are down significantly since a recent national average price of more than $5 per gallon in June, the average as of Tuesday was still $4.33, compared to $3.16 one year ago, and approximately $2.39 when Biden first took office in January 2021.\n\nIn our commentary tonight, we have some good news and a lesson in civics to report about our Second Amendment rights.\n\nThe Second Amendment is just one element of our Constitution that sets America apart from most other nations, and it\u2019s a part of the Constitution that Democrats would love to eliminate.\n\nIn direct response to the staggering amount of pressure that gun owners have been applying to Congress, Nancy Pelosi was forced to pull the \u2018Assault Weapons\u2019 ban from the calendar on Wednesday, July 27.\n\nEven more encouraging, insiders are reporting a revolt inside the Democratic caucus, as vulnerable Democrats are terrified that voting on this bill would crush them in November.\n\nAnd with Congress taking a six-week vacation beginning Friday, it is going to be a much harder lift for Biden\u2019s handlers to get the momentum they need for this bill when Congress returns for its final session before the midterm elections.\n\nThe American Firearms Association was among those on the ground for weeks, lobbying against this bill and bolstering the resolve of pro-gun lawmakers.\n\nBut as you\u2019re about to hear, this threat is NOT over. For an overview on where things stand today with the assault weapons ban, here is an update from the American Firearms Association\u2019s Alex Dorr with Patrick Parsons.\n\nThank you for that report, Alex and Patrick. Yes, this is a battle that is going to get nastier and nastier because we know the Democrats want law-abiding Americans to be disarmed in violation of the Second Amendment.\n\nFrom everyone at the Worldview Report, we wish you a blessed evening. Thank you for tuning in. Take care, and may God Save America.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Your Tax Deductible Support at www.wvwfoundation.com Helps Us Cover Our Huge Streaming Bill So You and Millions of Americans Can Watch Our TV Shows For Free.
