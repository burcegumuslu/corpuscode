Today, they may vote to recommend COVID-19 shots be added to the routine childhood vaccination schedule. Action Alert!\n\nIf COVID vaccines are added to the childhood immunization schedule, it means billions in sales for vaccine manufacturers and complete liability protection when children or adults are harmed by the vaccines. Although this vote alone does not mean the vaccines are mandated for children, this could pave the way for vaccine mandates to attend school, as states and other entities look to the CDC recommendations in determining which vaccines should be mandated.\n\nWe\u2019ve been anticipating this move since the beginning of the pandemic. We alerted you to the fact that the drive to vaccinate children against COVID was fueled by a desire to eventually get an annual COVID shot approved as part of the CDC\u2019s recommended childhood schedule. If COVID vaccines are added to the childhood immunization schedule, it means billions in sales for vaccine manufacturers and complete liability protection when children or adults are harmed by the vaccines. Liability protection for COVID vaccines disappears when the Health Department determines there is no longer a public health emergency, but vaccines on the CDC\u2019s schedule are permanently protected from liability.\n\nRequired COVID shots for young children would be a tremendous boon for Big Pharma. It is crony medicine at its finest: special interests using the power and clout of the federal government to guarantee massive vaccine sales, all while being shielded from the responsibility of paying for the damage their products cause. It\u2019s a crony win-win.\n\nAction Alert! Write to the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, with a copy to Congress, and tell them we cannot sacrifice children\u2019s health for vaccine manufacturer profits.
