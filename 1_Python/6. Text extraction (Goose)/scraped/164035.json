Thankfully, a doctor swiftly performed a tracheostomy \u2013 which involves creating an opening in the neck so that a tube can be inserted into a person\u2019s windpipe.\n\nPaul was then placed into an iron lung and had to remain in the hospital for a period of 18 months.\n\nIn a documentary made by Mitch Summers, Paul said the following:\n\nWhen Paul was asked how he was spending his days, he replied:\n\n\u201cWell, the same thing everybody else does. I woke up, brushed my teeth, washed my face, shaved, had some breakfast. I just needed a little bit of help. I would read, or study something, paint a picture or do some drawing. I hated just watching TV.\u201d\n\nAfter finishing school, Paul did not get into college as people said he was \u201ctoo crippled\u201d and was not vaccinated for polio.\n\nTwo years later, the college accepted him on two conditions: that he get vaccinated and that a fraternity would be looking after him.\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, Paul was able to become an attorney after completing his exams.\n\nIn order to inspire others, he wrote his biography by using his mouth.\n\n\u201cNo matter where you\u2019re from or what your past is, or the challenges that you could be facing, you can truly do anything. You\u2019ve just got to set your mind to it and work hard,\u201d Paul said, adding that his \u201cstory is an example of why your past or even disability does not have to define your future.\u201d\n\nCheck out Mitch Summers\u2019 short documentary \u2018The Man in the Iron Lung\u2019 by clicking below.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Paul\u2019s inspiring story of hope?
