Last month, it put out a new policy requiring all of its roughly 25,000 employees to get vaccinated. In addition, the company required everyone to get two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by June 7 or risk termination.\n\nAccording to Houston Methodist CEO Marc Boom, 99 percent of the hospital system\u2019s employees were fully vaccinated by the passage of the imposed deadline. Only 178 individuals \u2013 less than one percent of the company\u2019s workforce \u2013 refused to get the vaccine and did not receive a deferral or a waiver from the company. These individuals were suspended for two weeks without pay.\n\nTwenty-seven of the 178 suspended workers have received one dose of the vaccine. Boom is hopeful that the two-week unpaid suspension will convince them to get the second dose.\n\nAll 178 workers are set to be fired if they refuse to get the first or second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by the end of their two-week suspension.\n\n\u201cWe are nearly 100 percent compliant with our COVID-19 vaccine mandate,\u201d wrote Boom in an email to staff on Tuesday, June 8. \u201cHouston Methodist is officially the first hospital system in the country to achieve this goal for the benefit of its patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the number could be zero, but unfortunately, a small number of individuals have decided not to put their patients first,\u201d added Boom. (Related: Houston Methodist Hospital orders staff to withhold adverse reactions caused by COVID vaccines from official records.)\n\nAn additional 332 employees were granted deferrals for pregnancies and other related medical reasons, and 285 employees were exempted due to medical or religious exemptions.\n\nRegarding the suspension, Boom said:\n\nHouston Methodist became the first hospital system in the U.S. to impose a vaccine mandate on its employees. Back in April, the hospital system told its administrative staff and new hires to get vaccinated by mid-April. It later extended this deadline to June 7. The company even offered employees a $500 bribe if they got vaccinated early on in the rollout of the vaccines.\n\nAfter the suspensions, dozens of protesters held a rally outside the Houston Methodist Baytown Hospital. They were joined by medical workers in the hospital who staged a walkout.\n\n\u201cNo one should be forced to put something into their body if they\u2019re not comfortable with it,\u201d said Jennifer Bridges, a nurse who has been working with the hospital system for over six years.\n\nBridges was presented with documentation regarding her suspension on June 7. \u201cI cried the whole way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an anti-vax person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to get it, by all means, get it. I don\u2019t take that away from anybody. Just let everybody have a choice and the right to make their own decision.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were joined by Dr. Angelina Farella, a pediatrician and member of America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a group that is strongly opposed to vaccine mandates, especially for the experimental coronavirus vaccines. Farella has refused to administer any of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cIf you are a healthy American under the age of 50 there is no reason for you to get this vaccine,\u201d she said. She added that the vaccines might actually be dangerous for people who have already recovered from the coronavirus and have naturally developed antibodies against it.\n\nFarella and the other protesters believe that the Houston Methodist Hospital system is downplaying data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the federal database for adverse reactions to vaccinations. VAERS indicates there have been a significant number of deaths and adverse events related to the coronavirus vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis is not how medicine was ever,\u201d said Farella. \u201cForcing people to get a vaccine, in some cases in which they are already immune since they\u2019ve had the disease, is medical tyranny.\u201d\n\nOne-hundred and seventeen of the suspended workers have filed a lawsuit against Houston Methodist over its vaccine mandate. The group is being represented by Jared Woodfill from the Houston-based Woodfill Law Firm.\n\nWoodfill said that, in addition to the 117 initial plaintiffs, another 50 individuals have indicated their interest in joining the lawsuit.\n\nThe Woodfill Law Firm has already asked the court to declare the hospital\u2019s vaccine mandate illegal. He argues that, because the vaccine is an experimental product, it should be illegal to force employees to receive it.\n\n\u201c[The vaccine] that\u2019s been on the market for less than a year. And yes, it\u2019s being used under [emergency use authorization], but at the same time, that is experimental by definition,\u201d said Woodfill.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fire someone for refusing to do something illegal, and if you look at federal law, it makes it very clear that it\u2019s illegal to force someone to participate in a vaccine trial.\u201d\n\nThe case was initially filed in the Montgomery County District Court. But it has since been moved to federal court. The case is being handled by Judge Lynn Hughes, who has requested filings from both parties and plans to make a quick decision. Woodfill said once Hughes has issued a ruling there may be an emergency appeal filed with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\u201cThis issue, in either this case or another, should end up before the Supreme Court,\u201d said Woodfill.\n\n\u201cWe will fight this all the way to the Supreme Court,\u201d said Bridges during the protest. \u201cThis is wrongful termination and a violation of our rights.\u201d\n\nLearn more about how companies like Houston Methodist are attempting to force their employees to take the coronavirus vaccine through vaccine mandates by reading the latest articles at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Houston Methodist Hospital suspends 178 employees who refused to get vaccinated", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2021-06-16-houston-methodist-hospital-suspends-unvaccinated-employees.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "The Houston Methodist Hospital system in Texas has suspended 178 employees without pay\u00a0for refusing to get vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).
