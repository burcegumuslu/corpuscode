This morning I heard Dennis Prager discussing the failure of many churches and synagogues to respond as the sources of refuge and consolation that they are supposed to be. He\u2019s right. To segregate congregants by vaccine status, with some houses of worship requiring proof of vaccination \u2014 since you can\u2019t trust anyone! \u2014 is disappointing, even shocking. The Daily Wire has a report on churches in this regard, but the same goes for plenty of synagogues.\n\nAnd now this comes to my attention, which is far worse. From Breitbart: \u201cOfficial in D.C. Mayor\u2019s Office: It\u2019s a \u2018Necessary Evil\u2019 to Allow \u2018Darwinism to Kill off\u2019 the \u2018Foolish\u2019 Unvaccinated.\u201d The individual in question directs the Mayor\u2019s Office of Veterans Affairs. He is Elliot Tommingo \u2014 not Dommingo with a \u201cD\u201d (a video on his own official website in which in introduces himself misspells his name). Mr. Tommingo holds the opinion that D.C. residents too stupid not to get vaccinated should die, presumably including any veterans in the city whose interests it\u2019s his job to serve.\n\nAm I misrepresenting his views, expressed on Facebook? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBreitbart News on Thursday obtained screenshots from one of Tommingo\u2019s conversations on a Facebook post. The commenter, Jonathan Lubecky, who on Twitter describes himself as a \u201cNonpartisan Political Consultant,\u201d remarked that he \u201cmay go to anywhere that doesn\u2019t have the stupid mandates DC has.\u201d\u2026 Tommingo \u2026 provided a harsh response, demeaning unvaccinated people by touting a series of fake narratives and essentially asserting that unvaccinated individuals are \u201cfoolish\u201d and ultimately allowing Darwinism to take course. \u201cI\u2019ll join you in Cabo man. But I tell ya. If people stopped listening to celebrities, took the vaccine, didn\u2019t eat horse dewormer and/or their own piss\u2026we could lift those mandates soon,\u201d he claimed. \u201cHowever, allowing Darwinism to kill off those too foolish to protect themselves is a necessary evil,\u201d Tommingo added. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting take given the vaccine stats in DC,\u201d Lubecky responded. \u201cBut to be clear, you support 48% of black citizens of DC dying due to \u2018Darwinism\u2019 and \u2018being too foolish\u2019 \u2018drinking piss\u2019 and \u2018eating horse dewormer.\u2019\u201d According to the D.C. government website\u2019s latest data, 43.4 percent of the city\u2019s black population is considered \u201cfully vaccinated,\u201d meaning the majority are not and are, according to Tommingo, allowing \u201cDarwinism\u201d to chart their course \u2014 a \u201cnecessary evil,\u201d also according to Tommingo.\n\nThat\u2019s heartless. In a city whose demographic profile is 41.4 percent African-American, it also looks very much like an illustration of what historian Richard Weikart in his new book calls Darwinian Racism. Weikart traces the development of evolutionary thinking from Darwin to Hitler to modern-day white nationalism. Tommingo, in case you wondered, is a white guy from Iowa. He\u2019s also a 14-year veteran of the Marines. What a shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a rule of thumb that for anyone like Mr. Dommingo \u2014 excuse me, Mr. Tommingo \u2014 too clueless not to realize he shouldn\u2019t write such a thing in a public forum where someone could take a screenshot of his comment, there are many, many more who might say much the same in a more veiled fashion or in private or who might be smart enough to keep the view to themselves.\n\nJust so that readers don\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m not anti-vaccination. In fact, I\u2019m still a bit fatigued today from getting a booster shot on Wednesday, something I had hesitated about doing. Getting vaccinated, or not, is a personal decision, to be respected as such. That should be obvious. Yet it\u2019s hard not to recognize the will to punish, intimidate, and dehumanize the unvaccinated. Think of it: in Tommingo\u2019s case, to take this public servant at his word, he actually wants to them to die. That\u2019s what a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d means.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elliot-Tommingo-2-scaled.jpeg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1344", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Darwinian Racism in the District of Columbia | Evolution News", "description": "Elliot Tommingo holds the opinion that residents too stupid not to get vaccinated should die.", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2022/02/darwinian-racism-d-c-official-would-see-unvaccinated-die-of-covid-as-a-necessary-evil/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2022-02-04T22:57+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2022-02-04T22:53+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-04T22:57+00:00"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "Washington DC", "synagogues", "booster shot", "Twitter", "vaccination", "African-Americans", "churches", "Elliot Tommingo", "Jonathan Lubecky", "Richard Weikart", "COVID-19", "Darwinism", "Breitbart News", "Mayor\u2019s Office of Veterans Affairs", "Darwinian racism", "The Daily Wire", "Dennis Prager", "unvaccinated"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.dailywire.com/news/neither-vaccinated-nor-unvaccinated-how-churches-imposing-vaccine-mandates-are-dividing-christians-with-a-different-gospel", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/04/official-dc-mayors-office-its-necessary-evil-allow-darwinism-kill-foolish-unvaccinated/", "https://communityaffairs.dc.gov/mova", "https://twitter.com/jonlubecky", "https://coronavirus.dc.gov/data/vaccination", "https://www.amazon.com/Darwinian-Racism-Darwinism-Influenced-Nationalism/dp/1637120095"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-02-04T22:53+00:00"}
