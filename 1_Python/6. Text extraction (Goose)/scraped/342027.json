(Related: POTUS Trump: \u2018People would revolt\u2019 if Democrats impeach him.)\n\nFirst of all, earlier this month CNN reported that special counsel Robert Mueller received a six-month extension from a federal judge in Washington, D.C., for the grand jury convened on his behalf. The network, which has, of course, been unreliable when it comes to reporting about POTUS Trump in the past, noted that the grand jury\u2019s 18-month term was set to expire.\n\nThe report, which was eventually corroborated by other media, noted further:\n\nThe extension is the surest sign yet that the Russia investigation isn\u2019t finished. It means, broadly, that Mueller may continue pursuing alleged criminal activity related to the Russian government\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and that more indictments may be coming.\n\nThere is a lot going on to support Roger Stone\u2019s claim\n\nAlso, Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee who are vetting the president\u2019s attorney general nominee, William Barr, have shown a particular interest in making sure that Mueller\u2019s probe continues \u2014 something Barr pledged would happen.\n\n\u201cI believe it is vitally important that the Special Counsel be allowed to complete his investigation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe it is in the best interest of everyone \u2013 the president, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people \u2013 that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work,\u201d Barr noted further, adding that he believes Mueller \u201cis well along in his investigation.\u201d\n\nFor that matter, Barr himself is seen as a Washington insider \u2014 he was first President George H. W. Bush\u2019s attorney general and though he identifies with the Republican Party, is generally well-respected by the D.C. establishment (which means the Deep State). What\u2019s more, Barr says he told POTUS Trump \u201chow well I knew Bob Mueller and that the Barrs and Mueller were good friends and would be good friends when this was all over,\u201d adding that \u201cBob is a straight shooter and should be dealt with as such.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the calls for the president\u2019s impeachment \u2014 despite the fact that no criminal collusion with Russia has been found and proven, and no other charges exist against him \u2014 are becoming blatant and open. The National Sentinel reported Friday:\n\nSure, he tweets a lot. He takes government planes away from Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He\u2019s brusque, feisty, combative, and sometimes petulant (who in Washington isn\u2019t?).\n\nBut the constitutional standard for impeachment is \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d and so far that standard hasn\u2019t been met.\n\nClearly there is an ongoing unhealthy obsession among factions in Washington, D.C., to \u201cget\u201d President Trump and expel him from office. That realization alone lends credibility to Roger Stone\u2019s claim.\n\nRead more about the rebellious scheming of the Deep State at DeepState.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Roger Stone: Deep State plans to remove POTUS Trump, VP Pence, to install Pelosi and Hillary in COUP", "type": "article", "url": "2019-01-20-roger-stone-deep-state-plans-to-remove-potus-trump-vp-pence-to-install-pelosi-and-hillary-in-coup.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "Longtime political strategist Roger Stone believes that elements of the Democrat-aligned Deep State are plotting a coup that will see POTUS Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence removed from office, which would then hand the presidency to No.", "image": "wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2019/01/roger-stone-target.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2019-01-20T11:19:39+00:00", "image:width": "1197", "image:height": "1026", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2019-01-20T11:19:39+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-01-20T11:19:39+00:00", "article:author": "author/jdheyes", "article:publisher": "/", "article:section": "Politics", "article:tag": "william barr"}, "tags": ["coup", "government", "deep state", "hoax", "presidency", "Attorney General", "Nancy Pelosi", "Republicans", "President Trump", "Robert Mueller", "treason", "Roger Stone", "William Barr", "special counsel", "Russian collusion", "impeachment", "political coup", "Collusion", "Vice President Pence", "Hillary Clinton", "lawless"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.infowars.com/roger-stone-warns-of-deep-state-coup-to-install-pelosi-then-hillary-as-president/", "https://www.newstarget.com/2018-12-12-potus-trump-people-would-revolt-if-democrats-impeach-him.html", "https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/04/politics/mueller-grand-jury/index.html", "http://www.robertmueller.news", "https://thenationalsentinel.com/2019/01/18/impeach-trump-after-all-of-these-obama-high-crimes-and-misdemeanors/", "http://www.deepstate.news", "https://thenationalsentinel.com/2019/01/18/impeach-trump-after-all-of-these-obama-high-crimes-and-misdemeanors/", "https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/04/politics/mueller-grand-jury/index.html", "https://www.infowars.com/roger-stone-warns-of-deep-state-coup-to-install-pelosi-then-hillary-as-president/", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fwhitehousenews%2F2019-01-20-roger-stone-deep-state-plans-to-remove-potus-trump-vp-pence-to-install-pelosi-and-hillary-in-coup.html&linkname=Roger%20Stone%3A%20Deep%20State%20plans%20to%20remove%20POTUS%20Trump%2C%20VP%20Pence%2C%20to%20install%20Pelosi%20and%20Hillary%20in%20COUP", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019-01-20T11:19:39+00:00"}
