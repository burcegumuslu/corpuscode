Amazingly Kuru has now been found in 8 to 20 people, out of all places, in war-torn Syria, and the only way it could have come about, doctors confirmed, is through cannibalism and the consumption of human brain, \n\n as first reported by Arabian news source Zaman al-Wasal and substantiated by Orient News Television.\n\nHere is a documentary showing the connection between native sorcery, ritualized cannibalism, and its end result, Kuru:\n\nTwo of the infected were sent from Syria to a hosptial in Ghazi Antab in Turkey for further examination to only be transferred to another hospital in Germany. One of the two already died, since Kuru is 100% fatal. Kuru is contagious and has symptoms of skin ulcers and worms, and according to a piece on the New York Times,\n\nKuru is a very rare disease. It is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue. Kuru is found among people from New Guinea who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual.\n\nOne of the infected men in the German hospital was confirmed to have eaten human flesh, and he eventually died. When the Turkish hospital was asked on the details of the cannibalism case, they refrained from saying anything.\n\nMoreover, the Free Syrian Army said they will be doing an investigation on the cannibalism case, and this sparks a hunch as to what their intentions are behind this.\n\nOverall, there are 8 to 20 cases of Kuru in Syria; Kuru strictly is caused by cannibalism, and cannibalism was involved from the report on what took place in the German hospital.\n\nIn past studies, it was established that in the area of Fore in Paupa New Guinea, Kuru was transmitted due to \u201critualistic mortuary cannibalism.\u201d\n\nIt is quite possible that this is what commenced the infection, in that the jihadists began to eat the flesh of their enemies.\n\nCannibalism is not beyond the nature of the Muslim rebels, here is a video of a Syrian jihadist eating a lung:\n\nWe have written extensively on Islamic cannibalism, which can be found here, here, here, and here.\n\nPlease donate to Rescue Christians and and save Christian lives.\n\nGet my latest book, For God or For Tyranny", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cannibalism In Syria Causes An Extremely Rare Disease  - Walid Shoebat", "description": "Cannibalism in Islam", "url": "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/", "site_name": "Walid Shoebat", "article:published_time": "2013-11-04T23:44:03+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2013-11-05T02:49:44+00:00", "image": "https://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Syrian-rebel-Eat-Heart.jpg", "image:width": "690", "image:height": "490"}, "tags": ["jihad", "muslims", "fsa", "Cannibalism", "sharia", "ritual human sacrifice", "islam", "free syrian army", "syria", "kuru", "Assad", "muslim brotherhood"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "440", "height": "325", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"440\" height=\"325\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/vw_tClcS6To\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/vw_tClcS6To"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "440", "height": "325", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"440\" height=\"325\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qxb8OFbwMQQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/qxb8OFbwMQQ"}], "links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCcURkyVdSg#t=191", "http://www.zamanalwsl.net/news/42485.html", "http://www.zamanalwsl.net/news/42485.html", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0g89T3Tnic", "http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/kuru/overview.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2008/08/11/the-shaking-death-cjd-epidemic/", "http://shoebat.org/2013/05/13/islamic-ritualistic-cannibalism-caught-on-film/", "http://shoebat.org/2013/01/28/islam-and-cannibalism/", "http://shoebat.org/2013/03/07/the-promotion-of-human-sacrifice-and-cannibalism-in-egypt/", "http://shoebat.org/2013/08/13/another-islamic-cannibalism-case-discovered/", "http://rescuechristians.org/purchasedonate/", "https://www.amazon.com/For-God-Tyranny-Nations-Natural/dp/0982567901", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=facebook", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=twitter", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=reddit", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=linkedin", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/#print", "#", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=skype", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=telegram", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=pocket", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=pinterest", "https://shoebat.com/2013/11/04/new-cases-cannibalism-muslim-syria/?share=tumblr", "https://shoebat.com/donation/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013-11-04T23:44:03+00:00"}
