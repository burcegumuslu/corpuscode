Have a vaccine ready for human testing in an unprecedented 90 days.\n\nNIH is partnering with a US vaccine company, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThe vaccine is a new type called RNA. According to Reuters (\u201cWith Wuhan virus genetic code in hand, scientists begin work on a vaccine,\u201d Jan 24, 2020), \u201c[these are] vaccines based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) \u2014 a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins.\u201d\n\nThe PHG Foundation/University of Cambridge explains further: \u201cUnlike a normal vaccine, RNA vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence (the molecule which tells cells what to build) which is coded for a disease specific antigen [virus]; once produced within the body, the antigen [virus] is recognised by the immune system, preparing it to fight the real thing.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at Moderna (twitter), the company that will be making and testing the new RNA vaccine against the China coronavirus. Its website states, in a January 23rd press release: \u201cModerna Announces Funding Award from CEPI to Accelerate Development of Messenger RNA (mRNA) Vaccine Against Novel Coronavirus\u201d.\n\nFunded by CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations). Who is that? (twitter) Its website states: \u201cCEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We\u2019re working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.\u201d\n\nA more relevant quote: \u201cCEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum.\u201d\n\nBill Gates. Doesn\u2019t that send your trust and faith rocketing up into the sky?\n\nThere is more. Going back to the Moderna Inc. website \u2014 at the bottom of the press release referenced above, we find a VERY interesting statement, in a section titled, \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d: \u201c\u2026there has never been a commercial product utilizing mRNA technology approved for use\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd there you have it. The vaccine that is being tapped by the US government\u2026 under its National Institutes of Health\u2026through drug company Moderna\u2026HAS NEVER BEEN USED ON THE PUBLIC BEFORE. IT IS NOT LICENSED FOR PUBLIC USE.\n\nRNA VACCINES AND THE TECHNOLOGY THEY USE ARE ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL.\n\nAND THIS IS THE TYPE OF VACCINE BEING RUSHED INTO EXISTENCE IN 90 DAYS.\n\nWhat in the world could possibly go wrong?\n\nOne way to find out is to unleash it on millions of people, stand back, and see.\n\nThe PHG Foundation at the University of Cambridge gives us a substantial clue: \u201c\u2026 better understanding of [RNA] vaccine adverse effects is needed \u2014 these can include inflammation or autoimmune reactions.\u201d\n\nAutoimmune reactions \u2014 the human immune system attacks healthy elements and processes of the body itself. The body goes to war with itself.\n\nI\u2019m sure you would volunteer for a test run of the vaccine, right? You would certainly offer up your child for a grand experiment, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a doctor reading this, you\u2019ll definitely inject the vaccine into unsuspecting patients, won\u2019t you? Conscience is such an annoyance, isn\u2019t it?\n\nDon\u2019t you want to have the whole world as your guinea pig?\n\nPolitico (9/14/22): \u201cHow Bill Gates and partners [Gavi (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization), Wellcome Trust, CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations)] used their clout to control the global Covid response \u2014 with little oversight; [These] [f]our health organizations, working closely together, spent almost $10 billion on responding to Covid across the world. But they lacked the scrutiny of governments, and fell short of their own goals, a POLITICO and WELT investigation found\u201d\n\nThese \u201cGreatest COVID Hits\u201d Series Of Articles are archived under the category Covid Revisited\n\nThese articles \u2014 at the time of original publication \u2014 are archived under the category Covid\n\nTo read Jon\u2019s articles on Substack, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
