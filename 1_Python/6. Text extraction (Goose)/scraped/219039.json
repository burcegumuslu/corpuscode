Andrew Wood, a Marines spokesman, told The Hill in a statement.\n\nThe numbers for the data include reserves, active-duty, and Individual Mobilization Augmentee Marines, according to CNN.\n\nWood said the Marines mostly include \u201cyoung and healthy individuals\u201d and that there are multiple reasons they might decline the vaccine.\n\n\u201cFor example, an individual may have deferred until later to allow others to get the vaccine, they may have gotten the vaccine on their own and not through military channels, they could be unavailable for a second dose in the prescribed time period for the vaccines that require two doses, they could expect the vaccine to become mandatory and are waiting until then, or they may be allergic to one of the compounds in the vaccine,\u201d Wood said.\n\nThe military previously estimated that 66 percent would accept the coronavirus vaccine, according to CNN.\n\nWood said any individual who originally declined the vaccine can change their mind and receive it.\n\n\u201cWe continue to make the vaccine available to Marines, Sailors, civilians, contractors and authorized beneficiaries based on the prioritization schedule listed in the [Department of Defense] population schema,\u201d Wood said.\n\nSince the vaccines have only emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the military can not require that servicemembers get vaccinated.\n\nCamp Lejeune in North Carolina saw a 57 percent decline rate for the vaccine, the data showed.\n\n\u201cWe fully understand that widespread acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine provides us with the best means to defeat this pandemic,\u201d Wood said.\n\nThe revelation comes as Democratic lawmakers have started a push to make the COVID jab mandatory for all members of the military.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony Fauci, US service members who are eligible but opt out of taking the coronavirus vaccine are \u201cinadvertently being part of the problem\u201d of lengthening the pandemic.\n\nWhile the military is currently barred from mandating any of the coronavirus vaccines rolled out in the US, as each has received only emergency FDA approval rather than full authorization, some in Congress have pressed the Joe Biden administration to change that.\n\nIn a letter sent to the White House last month, a group of Democratic lawmakers led by California Rep. Jimmy Panetta argued that unvaccinated soldiers pose a \u201ccritical threat to our national security and public health,\u201d calling on the president to issue a waiver overriding the rules \u2013 as well as the \u201cinformed consent\u201d of the troops.\n\n\u201cVaccinating every eligible service member will improve readiness and have an immediate and positive impact on the communities in which they serve,\u201d Panetta wrote in the letter, which was co-signed by six House Democrats.\n\n\"Requiring [the Defense Department] to obtain informed consent prior to vaccination is not only harmful to our national security, but contrary to the best interests of service members, their families, communities and colleagues.\"\n\nService members are not permitted to decline other fully approved immunizations.\n\nOther survey data suggests that around 25% of Americans at large are not willing to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.\n\n[RELATED] Bill Gates: 'Final Hurdle' for COVID-19 Vaccine is Ensuring People Take It", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/marine-refuse-covid-vaccine-mandatory-military-111421.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "40% Marines Refuse COVID Vaccine Amid Calls to Make Jab Mandatory for Military", "description": "New data shows 38.9% of U.S. Marines have refused the vaccination - Almost 40 percent of U.S. Marines are refusing to get COVID-19 vaccines, according to n... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Military", "Vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/547534-40-percent-of-marines-have-declined-the-coronavirus-vaccine", "https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2021/03/24/lawmakers-call-on-biden-to-make-covid-vaccines-mandatory-for-the-military/", "https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/poll-1-4-americans-will-refuse-covid-19-vaccine", "../../news/11795-bill-gates-final-hurdle-for-covid-19-vaccine-is-ensuring-people-take-it"], "authors": ["Jay Greenberg"], "publish_date": "2021-04-11"}
