That of course, did not happen and online, many of them are expressing anger and disbelief. More worryingly, some of them are spinning new conspiracy theories about why that didn\u2019t happen. And what could happen next.\n\nif you see this, please save us.\n\nI don\u2019t even see our\n\nI\u2019m sorry. To all of the people that\n\nheld on and at false hope. I never believed that. God was gonna allow the evil to take over.\n\nDid you see the inauguration to see that thing? Well, I know you did, because I got so many requests to talk about it. And you know, so this would be a short one. And I\u2019m doing this to oblige. I read the comments. And people want to know, they want to know what\u2019s up with Lady Gaga. Why is she wearing the Hunger Games outfit? Well, I\u2019m gonna tell you about it. We could do this show in five minutes and be done. But why do that? Right. Let\u2019s stretch this out. Let\u2019s talk about the whole thing. Because you know, I don\u2019t do politics. That\u2019s not my thing. Yeah, so let\u2019s, let\u2019s talk about what happened here. President Joe Biden took the oath of office. Now he\u2019s in there. He\u2019s the the second Catholic president behind JFK. And typically, what happens is the loser president hangs out and shows the new one around formerly transitions, the power over but you know, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nTom Petty there couldn\u2019t hack it. couldn\u2019t take an L. And I know\n\nthough, he stole it. Oh, maybe, hey,\n\nwho knows? What\u2019s there like 62 court cases and even even all the judges that he appointed? said, No, there\u2019s no evidence? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t follow it. That\u2019s just conjecture. Don\u2019t crucify me on that. I think politics is a distractive waste of time. I think that there\u2019s you know, and I and I, I don\u2019t want to sound too pessimistic. But I look, I follow this stuff, right. And it\u2019s good to be an informed voter. I support voting. But I don\u2019t get too wrapped around the axles. Like, you gotta you got to disconnect. Sometimes. It\u2019s not that healthy for you, because the news and the politicians now to really rile people up self, good to pay attention. I think it\u2019s good to vote. I mean, right? Shouldn\u2019t we? Shouldn\u2019t we, at least, at least given a little bit to this, this hope of democracy? At least play along? Right. I mean, what else we\u2019re gonna believe in, you want to believe in anarchie? So, you know, I hold out faith a little bit I get skeptical of sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if these candidates aren\u2019t aren\u2019t selected over elected? I mean, that\u2019s what the conspiracy world wants to believe. And maybe, right, I mean, I mean, who would know? But I\u2019m living on a prayer over here. So anyway, it\u2019s a complicated answer. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t talk about it. Yeah, so. So what happened, right. And before we talk about Lady Gaga we, we can avoid the topic, the big topic, the great awakening the storm, the storm that was coming, but it never came. Before we talk about that quickly, looks like they\u2019ve followed the tradition that ronald reagan the occultist set up of doing the Both on the west side of the Capitol building, which you heard my go back to believe, of September 2020. I did a show on QA Nan in the cult, talking about the raising of Osiris ritual. I won\u2019t belabor the point. You\u2019ve heard it many times for me. But that was a ritualistic thing, right? You got the West lawn. And the President faces the Washington Monument, the phallus that\u2019s 666 feet supposedly, allegedly. And meanwhile, the 33rd degree Scottish Rite of Freemasonry Hara dome, they\u2019re trying to incarnate the spirit of Osiris into the incoming president. So if all things succeed, oh, Cyrus now looks like Joe Biden. Now what, what the and que en and I talked about on those QA on shows I did back in September, October. Like they, they\u2019re obsessed with the number 17, which is Q and numerology, the 17th letter. Well, 17 also represents Oh, Cyrus. And then I pointed to the idea that and I don\u2019t think I came up with this. I think Billy Ray Valentine helped me get here. I\u2019m not sure it doesn\u2019t matter. The idea was that Steve Bannon is probably the guy behind this cute nonsense. And then what do you know, most controversial Pardon? Trump gave out Steve Bannon. So there\u2019s that right. Lots of stuff. Will we ever get the real answers? I don\u2019t know. The QA nothing fell apart. I knew it was a sign up. I told you it was a sign up. And I\u2019m not saying I told you so I\u2019m just saying. I knew this was a sign from the beginning because none of it made any sense. It just didn\u2019t make any sense. And then on top of that, Steve Bannon, his background is to sow chaos and discord. Because he wants to bring about the end times so that they can bring about the golden age for the the elites, him and his elite buddies. Who are none of our friends. They could care less about us. It\u2019s true. So people you know that people like this idea, you know, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care Go for it. Don\u2019t do anything rash, don\u2019t like break into the Capitol building or try to take over the government. I mean, do you believe this stuff right? I don\u2019t care. I believe crazy. I don\u2019t think we went to the moon. Okay, look, I\u2019m crazy too. But it fell apart. I\u2019m gonna read you from communist news network here. Quote. For years believers of the QA non conspiracy theory, I\u2019ve been waiting for the moment when a grand plan would be put into action and secret members of a supposedly satanic pedophilia ring at the highest ranks of government and Hollywood would suddenly be exposed, rounding up and possibly even publicly executed. They were nearly always sure it was right around the corner but the storm never came. And the moment of joe biden\u2019s inauguration was the last possible opportunity for Trump to put the plan into motion. But as Biden raises his hand and sworn oath to defend the constitution, nothing happened. The anticlimax and QA non adherence into a frenzy of confusion and disbelief almost instantly shattering a collective delusion that had been nurtured and amplified by many on the far right. Now in addition to being scattered to various smaller websites after Facebook, Twitter cracked down on queueing on content. leavers risked having their own topsy turvy world turned upside down. Or perhaps right side up. Members of a QA non focus telegram channel you know that is that a new social media do Should I get over there? Should you like it subscribe me at telegram. I don\u2019t know what that is. And some humor. Some users of the image board 4chan vowed to keep the faith. Others proclaim they were renouncing their beliefs. Still others devise new theories that purported to push the ultimate showdown further into the future. One of the ideologies most visible icon Ron Watkins, goes by code monkeys told supporters to go back to our lives. Daniel Jones president of advanced democracy says the most hardcore QA non followers are in disarray. After years of waiting for the Great Awakening, they seem genuinely genuinely shocked to see President Biden inaugurated. Bah bah bah bah. Anyways, They go on to basically try to tell us that look, this thing\u2019s shutting down. All these people have been woken up to reality. And the great awakenings are happening the great roundup and am I gloating little bit kind of, because I got so much grief. And I follow a lot of these QA on bullshitters online, Jordan saothar someone challenged, someone wanted me and Jordan saothar to do a sort of debate on it. And I don\u2019t I don\u2019t do debates. I\u2019m way too stupid for that. And I but I was like, Okay, let\u2019s do it. I guess I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t believe I think this is all bunch of bullshit. So let\u2019s do it. And, you know, he declined, but in his defense, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t even know who I am. is a very popular him and David Wilcox out there, sharing their ancient aliens. QA non propaganda, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna do now. Lots of you know, patriot accounts out there pushing this stuff. Some of my friends push this stuff. So like, this isn\u2019t a judgment that we\u2019re all here to disagree. It\u2019s what we do. So what we do in America, we disagree with each other. But yeah, I think before the thing officially died, I was getting real upset about it. And I like get him to back off on the subject because it was really upsetting to me to see what seemed to me clearly to be a psyop and a lie. And every time I sort of like, try to with compassion, say this, like I\u2019d get burned. I\u2019m like, geez, you guys need to take it easy. Good, Lord. Now, I know you came here to get crazy. So let\u2019s get crazy because I\u2019m not gonna just stop at the CNN article. The mainstream normie knows. Are you kidding me? Let\u2019s see what they were saying in the in the 4chan and the forums and the reddits. before the inauguration, this Q guy, I mean, cube is weird, right? There\u2019s like the official cue that no one really knows who that is. And then there\u2019s like all the followers and the big mouthpieces for the movement. I don\u2019t know which one this was, I think it was just a person repeating the the lie. They posted the next 48 hours will be glorious. And there you know, this is before the inauguration again, pushing into the last second like this is happening friends. I\u2019m going to read you from it. This is what they believed. This is how crazy this shit got. The next 48 hours it will be like the entire Revolutionary War in the fall of Berlin compressed into two days. I\u2019ve called off work so I can witness history in the making. I think things will start moving midnight, but will not be noticed until 6am tomorrow. First we will see vague social media posts about helicopters, armored personnel carriers racing around DC neighbors filming a new roadblock that materializes on street This is written choppy, you know, bear with me, materializes on street a congress man live on lots of grainy vertical footage from random unsuspecting citizen that sort of thing. Think the prelude to the invasion of Crimea a few years back around noon it will start hitting the CNN Fox msnbc. unconfirmed reports of arrest possible terrorist attack a disturbance at congressman ex\u2019s house. then boom. The the news channels become static one by one, Twitter and Facebook goes down. Emergency Broadcast all cell phones and forums have attempted coup by globalist forces, vague reassurance that the union is strong America will be protected for the next 12 to 24 hours there\u2019s anxiety, fear and excitement as the population speculates on what is taking place 6am January 20 the news channels and social media come online Trump\u2019s on the podium surrounded by loyalists and cheering patriots soldiers thanks America for re election and announces that the coup has been has the thwarted what a time to be alive. See these these cute people have been like creating this fantasy world in the minds of the followers. This is I mean this is every day for the last four years they\u2019ve been doing this and and here\u2019s the here\u2019s what sucks about it. And we\u2019re gonna move on to Gaga here in just one second. Here it was talks about it because they they had some prolific names like wasn\u2019t a Mike Flynn out there, taking the oath telling you they\u2019re gonna round up the pedophiles publicly execute them Tom Hanks Tom Hanks do\n\nI know what he did take it easy. already know the whole script. I don\u2019t know. The Tom Hanks thing is tough for me. And we\u2019re gonna talk about Tom Hanks, too. I\u2019ll save that for later. But here\u2019s the thing that sucks. This is where we could get ultra paranoid. Maybe the cute thing was to shut down a real investigation and what was really happening because I\u2019ve been right there. At the beginning of this thing. I talked about the pizza emails. They\u2019re really weird. What the hell\u2019s going on? The spirit cooking really weird What\u2019s going on? Now, I\u2019m always sort of like your, um, your, um, your limp wristed conspiracy truth or so I\u2019m never the guy that\u2019s going to be like, yeah, they\u2019re doing it to the kids. Let\u2019s go attack them. Like, because we don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just I see the stuff. I see the evidence. And I think, well, surely something\u2019s going on here. This is really weird. And I sure wish the the news would look into this instead of just saying, Oh, yeah, Snopes says debugs. Like, we\u2019ll do a little bit of digging around. Why don\u2019t you? Why are they talking about walnut sauce and pizza maps on handkerchiefs? What does that mean? We still don\u2019t know, to this day. So it started with a grain of mystery. And then it just spiraled out of out of hand by the forces that be the powers that be. That\u2019s, that\u2019s what sucks. And then on top of that, you know, look at what look at what this did to the truth or movement. It discredited a ton of people. It gave them the leverage to censor truth or talk. When all truth or talk is is I mean to me. I mean, you know, some people get into this real deep like Alex Jones and stuff. And they\u2019re very persuasive. But to me, it\u2019s like, I like learning the symbolism. I like learning the history. I like exploring the ideas. I like entertaining the ideas. But until I\u2019m convinced like like, Look, I don\u2019t think we went to the moon. But I\u2019m not saying let\u2019s go take over the Cape Canaveral. I mean, good lord. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just saying like, it seems like we didn\u2019t go there. And it seems like it\u2019s a lot closer than they\u2019re telling us by the way. You want to get a little crazier? Because to me, it\u2019s it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s entertaining. And it\u2019s very possible, I think. Anyway, I\u2019m not going to go on this long diatribe of what why? Those things that happened at the Capitol Building shouldn\u2019t have happened, but they shouldn\u2019t have happened, but and now they\u2019re using it against us. So there you go. And I don\u2019t know if I don\u2019t know if I shared this with you on this feed. But look at what happened. It was mostly men, right? mostly men invaded the Capitol building. And symbolically you\u2019ve got the male dominance, the patriarchy invading the womb of ISIS the feminine, which takes us into Lady Gaga, the representative of the feminine goddess. She came out wearing red and black. She wore the this giant umbrella for a dress, it was red, but the top was black with black gloves. Now, these are very Saturnian colors here, red and black. But that\u2019s not what I want to focus on today. Let\u2019s look at that massive gold dove that she had pinned to her chest. Now, and this is what everyone was asking me about. But I was actually too busy yesterday to do this show. But anyway, and I said, Look, I first thought maybe it was a phoenix bird. I was like, Oh, damn, we got the alchemy thing. But she said officially it\u2019s a dove on our social medias. It\u2019s a dove with an olive branch. And you know that that symbolizes peace? Of course it does. So that\u2019s all that means. Time for healing time to move on. But what else could it mean? And I\u2019m and here let\u2019s entertain these ideas? Well, first of all that like everyone alluded to, is very Hunger Games ish. Which, you know, Canada\u2019s ever D and there was a lot of there was a lot of hunger games type programming that went down many years ago, fueled, fueling rebellion against the capital, and the Capitol building. And I thought it was weird how that manifested itself. In fact, I just watched all four films a couple weeks ago. And I thought it was also very curious how it went down. But the Mockingjay that\u2019s what we want to talk about today. This is the bird from the Hunger Games story which is The hero, Katniss Everdeen, she is basically the Mockingjay. She represents the Mockingjay. And this is where the worlds blend here. This is where the dress looked very Hunger Games. This is the Gaga war. And she also had the bird, which is part of the Hunger Games story. Now, if you look up the I only read the first Hunger Games book. I didn\u2019t read the others. So to look this up, but the Mockingjay is basically an accidental bird. It\u2019s an accidental hybrid. Between a Javert j and a mockingbird and you see it in the films, it like mocks and repeats the whistle. Okay. Not curious enough. I think it\u2019s a gnostic idea here. gnostic principles. Katniss Everdeen, she\u2019s wearing the Mockingjay pin. When she goes into the Hunger Games, she then takes on the moniker of the Mockingjay to leave the rebellion forces to inspire them. And why is that? It\u2019s because the bird the Mockingjay was a mistake. And so what\u2019s Katniss the mistake of her and what\u2019s all boy\u2019s name? You know, his name, the dude that she won the Hunger Games with? Pete boy, really shown how dumb I am now.\n\nPETA. That\u2019s who? Now Okay, so, so she\u2019s the anomaly, right? She\u2019s the mistake just like the Mockingjay. And she pisses off the capital, just like the Mockingjay. You see what happened historically, in the Hunger Games universe, capital created these birds called jabber Jays. And they sent them out to spy on the districts. But eventually, the districts learned about this and they started, the people started lying to the birds, so that when the Japanese went back to the Capitol, they would catch the light. Eventually, the Capitol figured it out. So they were like, Oh, forget it. So they released all the jabber Jays in the into the wild to die. But they didn\u2019t die. No, no, no. Instead, they found the mockingbirds. And they make bird sexy time. And it created a new bird a new species, the Mockingjay. So to the capital, the Mockingjay represents rebellion represents an amplification of their errors. It\u2019s a crack in the armor, just like Mockingjay as Katniss so you see Katniss she\u2019s the anomaly. She\u2019s the mistake that made it too far. She\u2019s too inspirational. She\u2019s the leader of the rebellion. And this is very gnostic because in the Gnostic story there\u2019s the the higher God, the the sort of global consciousness God. And this God is perfect. This is the the sun behind the sun, this is the perfect God. And an element of this perfect God was accidentally sort of released from the Sophia the wisdom. And this is a long story made very short. But the Sophia, the wisdom created this, this creation that was imperfect, the yalda both. And she rejected it, she was embarrassed. So she pushed you out of both out of this world and into ours. She aborted it basically. And yelled of both. Being imperfect, said I\u2019m going to create my own world. I\u2019m going to model it based on the spiritual world I just came from, I\u2019m gonna be God. But, you know, Jada, both imperfect, out of both a mess. And the out of both created our world and wanted us to worship Him, because he\u2019s real narcissistic and crazy. And there\u2019s all this death and pain and suffering in this world because it\u2019s imperfect. Well, yalda both is the mistake that went too far. Just like the Mockingjay just like Katniss Everdeen. And that\u2019s why like the Gnostics think we\u2019re in a prison planet. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t. They don\u2019t subscribe to this. They think the Christian faith is wrong for worshipping the false god because the real God is many levels of abstraction higher and more perfect. So you\u2019ve got the jabber Jays and the mockingjays. All they can do is replicate and mimic. That\u2019s why they repeat the whistles. And this is just like the demiurge which is created by the out of both. They can\u2019t, they can\u2019t do anything perfectly. All they can do is create and mimic They have no creative abilities. So Candace evany, she wears the Mockingjay pin to mock the capital for their failures. So that\u2019s all the Hunger Games talk. Now, the pin the bird that the golden dove with the olive, it symbolizes alchemy, it\u2019s the perfected initiate. So let\u2019s talk about the dove first. And this is from the chemical perspective. Because in alchemy, there\u2019s there\u2019s birds that represent the stages of the process of the perfecting of the initiates. Birds are important because they represent this sort of blurring of realms it\u2019s the connection of as above and so below the connection of the spiritual and the material. And the birds represent the soul in the alchemical symbolism. And the birds they show us the stages of this spiritual development, it\u2019s the soul as it progresses spiritually. And usually what we look for is like the eagle or the Phoenix, that\u2019s like the final stage. That\u2019s, that\u2019s, uh, you know, there\u2019s like the Hunger Games like, Katniss is the Girl on Fire, the fire is the Phoenix. And the birds, let\u2019s talk about the birds, you\u2019ve got the stages of the process, from going from black to gold, because an alchemy is, you know, turning lead into gold. And you got the black crow, you got the white swan, you got the peacock, you got the Pelican. And then finally you got the Phoenix or the eagle in the case of America. And the stages of turning lead into gold, of course starts with the integrator, that\u2019s the blackening. That\u2019s the black crow. And this is the separation of the soul from the body. Because again, in the Gnostic perception of things, the body is a material prison. Because the out of both took formless material and created our world and trapped our souls in the body. So the dove, that lady gaga is wearing represents the soul. It\u2019s the soul bird of alchemy, if you want to look at it from that perspective. And you\u2019ll see this in all chemical artworks, with the dove sitting on a skull. The dove reflecting on the death of the body, because the skull is very important to the occult, right? You have this formless material that formed over time through evolution and the skull in case the mind in case the brain is without the skull, the brain couldn\u2019t function couldn\u2019t have these higher levels of thought, like the real God. So the skull is celebrated, but the skull is also a dead thing. So without death, you can\u2019t have life. You see. So that\u2019s why in the Freemasonry, the the reflection chamber in the initiates sits inside or reflects upon their own death. So it could do anything right. Well, you also saw this in the inauguration. We have life and death there was 400,000 flags representing all the deaths from COVID. Now that the dove with the olive branch, obviously that goes back to Noah in the great flood the great dailies and what you know, you know the story now I\u2019ll release the dove and when the dove came back with the olive branch, it symbolize that the dove was able to land on on land, the flood was receding, and the death and destruction was over. So good news, Lady Gaga has shown you symbolically there\u2019s a reprieve from all this death. It\u2019s over. Aren\u2019t you happy? Yeah, I know you\u2019re not. I know. The truth is I\u2019m never happy. We\u2019re never happy. Because I know all Isaac. Oh, you\u2019re happy that they stopped you and made you believe in a fake will hand flew? Like I just want I just want to be happy. Okay, we\u2019re gonna be happy. We\u2019re gonna let\u2019s just play dumb. This is play along for a minute. Just for a minute. It\u2019s entertainment. Okay, good. Here comes here comes sleepy Joe to save the day and he\u2019s gonna make it all better. And symbolically, there\u2019s death and destruction is over and the chaos has ended. Well, good. I\u2019ll take it at this point. I mean, do you care? let them win. let them win. Let the Illuminati witness time. Because it\u2019s like on the one hand like, Well played, I\u2019m exhausted with this and you win. Like online And but like I always say I\u2019m a bad truth or don\u2019t listen to me. Don\u2019t come to me for influence come to me for information and then deal with it what you will do what thou wilt with the info. Second, let\u2019s talk about the bird. Why is it gold? Well, you know, alchemy, right? Turning lead into gold. You\u2019re perfecting man. Through the great work, the Negredo the blackening all the way up through the Phoenix which is represented as gold or red sometimes, or red angle to fire. Because the Phoenix is the fire, which is again representative of the the true God, above the out of both, this is the undivided light from which all is created. It\u2019s also called the astral gold. It\u2019s the sun behind the sun, which you hear, which is, which is the serious thing, right? You talk about serious you talk about the Freemason lodges, they\u2019ve got the sun behind the sun, of serious on the walls, look it up. This is the spiritual source for all life. This is the origin of the divine spark. This is the part of us that has the real God within and the initiate needs to learn it and unlock it. So gold is very important in this. It\u2019s the final stage of the great work. This is the golden body. Kind of like Eddie Murphy, the golden child. It releases the candidate to the divine mind, aka the undivided light aka the astral gold and the candidate has ascended past the fake yalda both the Christian God the fake God. So yes, the gold dove could be some alchemical symbolism and that\u2019s basically it. Now there was also the inauguration ball let\u2019s not gloss over that hosted by you know who you know who the name this shall not be spoken Tom Hanks. Oh my god, and I\u2019ve never been Logan here\u2019s where I\u2019m a bad truth. Or I like Tom Hanks. I like his movies. I mean, is he a creepy person? I\u2019ve no idea he\u2019s probably I don\u2019t know. Who knows. Never met the guy. Sure is fun in the movies. Oh, Forrest Gump Come on. The and here\u2019s the here\u2019s the here\u2019s my short version of why I don\u2019t buy this. First off, it\u2019s it\u2019s to QE for me. Second off, I did a whole show on Isaac Cappy. I did a lot of research and Isaac Cappy and he fits into the Tom Hanks thing. The reason Tom Hanks gets dragged into this is because he posts photos on his Instagram of like, gloves left like a single glove left on the ground. And I guess the joke is kind of like, who walks around two gloves and loses one like, Don\u2019t they know they\u2019re missing a glove? I guess I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really understand, I think is that funny, but whatever. And he was doing this for years. Well, and I could get these details wrong just a little bit. But basically Isaac caffee this very vocal cue guy killed himself on this overpass off route 66. And on the same day, or the day before, Tom Hanks had this ominous post about offer route 66 with a glove missing. And now that means he\u2019s Illuminae confirming all these things. There might be more to it. I don\u2019t know. Like I\u2019ve said I\u2019ve never I\u2019ve never bought into the queue thing. So I didn\u2019t dig too deep. It\u2019s full disclosure there like I could be way wrong on that. I mean, you can do your own research. But that was the gist of what I saw. And I thought really that\u2019s that\u2019s the thing we\u2019re gonna hate Tom Hanks for. I mean, it was also weird that he was like the first guy in the world to get COVID that was kind of weird. It\u2019s also weird that he\u2019s gonna be in a Pinocchio as as Japan Oh, the pedo dead. That\u2019s kind of weird. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re screwing around with the QA non folks like they\u2019re they\u2019re purposely messing with them. I mean, to have Joe Biden in there. And then Tom Hanks, and Lady Gaga. They just twisting the knife now. I don\u2019t know. seems weird to me. And then he had all these other performances at the inauguration Bollywood Katy Perry. She\u2019s very illuminate confirm. I\u2019ve talked about her for many years. The Demi Lovato she\u2019s illuminated but she only talks about the aliens, heard Kesha or Dharma how much they love meditate and aliens into existence. Get the Foo Fighters the Foo Fighters were they promoted some lady who thought aids was fake. Remember that They played at some fundraiser, this woman was told she had AIDS back in the 90s. And she was like, No, don\u2019t fake news doctor. And she was going around telling everyone about how HIV doesn\u2019t really cause aids and AIDS is something else, and they\u2019re lying to us. And the Foo Fighters did some benefit concert for this lady, then a lady got pregnant. And the doctor was like, hey, you\u2019re going to give your baby HIV and AIDS, so you should take these drugs? And she was like, No, I\u2019m not age is fake. It\u2019s fake news. So she has the baby and the baby dies at like two years old of HIV AIDS. Then mom dies couple years later, HIV AIDS. So this is what happens when conspiracies go too far. Right? Because I remember that was a hot topic for a long time.\n\nwe\u2019re gonna I don\u2019t want to go down that rabbit hole, do you? Well see where aids really came from. If you go back to the polio vaccine in Africa, they had monkeys that had a disease called Siv and the monkeys with the Siv where they grind up the monkey guts to make the first some of the first polio vaccines and then they injected them into human beings. And then human beings all of a sudden in Africa have HIV everywhere that happen anywhere anyway. Then also, at the inauguration, we had the first US citizen we get the the COVID stabby. Introducing Tom, Tom. Tim McGraw I guess to publicly show like hey, she\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s fine. Look at her. She\u2019s up moving around. She\u2019s partying. Everything\u2019s fine. And I hope so. I\u2019m burying my head in the sand this year. I\u2019m um, I\u2019m going off for it. Give me the Give me the feel goods. Tell me everything\u2019s gonna be great big brother. Tell me how great the world\u2019s gonna be. Okay, cool.\n\nthis is where things get tough for me. It\u2019s been a hard year the breaking us down one by one. But yeah, that\u2019s a that\u2019s the latest that\u2019s that\u2019s the updates on the inauguration, we got the full death of QA down we got Lady Gaga showing us the symbolism about chemical perfection. And you got Tom Hanks, sticking his knife in, in the QA non people and twisted it all around making them very upset. It\u2019s gonna be a wild year this year to unplug. I know traditionally, I\u2019m the guy to point out all the stuff all the symbolism and say everyone\u2019s illuminate confirm, which isn\u2019t wrong. Right. However 2021 we\u2019re bringing the positive vibes until we can all feel good, right? Maybe they\u2019re pushing the globalist agenda down the tracks would be great reset. I see evidence for that too. Could be but maybe not also. I mean, all we can do is make conjectures and theories and see what happens. So there you go. That\u2019s that\u2019s what I got for it. You were asking about that. So there we go. Hunger Games. Golden birds. Missing gloves, Tom Hanks. We got it. We got a very controversial show. That\u2019s you bake all that and make one big controversy cookie. So I hope you enjoyed it. Hope you learn something with me. We\u2019re all learning this thing.
