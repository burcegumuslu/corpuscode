I\u2019ve kept up on the current research because I feel passionately about the issue, but I\u2019ve never wavered. None of my 6 children have been vaccinated\u2026and they never will be. (They\u2019re also healthy; the worst we\u2019ve dealt with has been the chicken pox, and that wasn\u2019t that bad.)\n\nAnyway, parents today continue to debate it. Should I vaccinate? Should I get just some vaccines? If so, which ones and when?\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a lot more pressure and propaganda today, that makes it much harder to decide \u2014 or even seek out the truth. (Did you know when I was pregnant in 2007, flu shots weren\u2019t universally recommended for pregnant women, and Tdap shots simply weren\u2019t given? My very, very mainstream OB brought these up exactly zero times, and when I asked about a flu shot, said \u201cWell, I always recommend flu shots, but really it\u2019s up to you.\u201d And she did not that take attitude on very many things\u2026.)\n\nSo how are you supposed to separate fact from fiction? What\u2019s the real science say? Let\u2019s take a look at some \u201cfacts\u201d that are commonly passed around, and how true they are (or not).\n\nIt\u2019s not my goal to come across as 100% \u201canti-vaccine,\u201d although for my own family, I am. Frankly, I\u2019m tired of the manipulation and fearmongering. My goal here is to stick to the facts and provide a balanced point of view. All my sources will be cited, so don\u2019t feel like you need to take my word for it \u2014 do click through and read them for yourself.\n\nI\u2019ll be addressing things the mainstream often brings up, point by point, so that you have an easy way of evaluating what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t\u2026and why. This will make it easier to combat the fear, and make a fact-based decision.\n\nIf, at the end, you still have questions, you can check my Vaccine Posts page to see if the answers are there, or just leave me a comment and ask.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting I\u2019m not a doctor or medical professional and I\u2019m not telling you what to do. I\u2019m just a concerned parent, doing my research \u2014 as everyone should.\n\nSo! Here we go.\n\n#1: These diseases are super deadly; get vaccinated or die!\n\nThis is kind of a horrible lie, because it leaves parents guessing what \u201cdeadly\u201d really means. Are the diseases \u201cdeadly\u201d in the sense that they can kill you? Yes, they are. Are they deadly in the sense that they\u2019re likely to kill you? No, they\u2019re not.\n\nPrior to the vaccine, measles killed roughly 1 in every 1000 reported cases, and about 1 in 8000 total cases. (Around 500,000 people actually came in to the doctor with measles annually, but since almost everyone got measles then, about 4 million actually had it each year.) (source)\n\nAs for pertussis (whooping cough), in 2016, there were approximately 18,000 cases. There were 7 deaths, for a rate of about 1 in 3000 cases. 6 of those deaths were in babies under a year. Of the 16,000 cases in people over a year old, there was only one death. The report does not say, but typically, the immunocompromised are more likely to die. Healthy children over a year almost never die of pertussis. (source)\n\nWhat about mumps? The CDC calls death from mumps \u201cexceedingly rare.\u201d (source) Up to 10% of adolescent or adult men will get orchitis (swelling of the testes), but sterility is extremely rare. Fewer than 1% of women will experience swelling of breasts or ovaries. Other serious complications also occur at less than 1%. No deaths have occurred from mumps in many years. Mumps is generally so mild that it isn\u2019t even a reportable illness.\n\nHow about chicken pox? Well, from this study, \u201c\u2026varicella was considered a benign disease\u2026\u201d and \u201cAlthough serious clinical consequences from primary VZV infection were relatively uncommon, the societal cost, such as days of lost work, attributable to varicella were estimated to be over $1.5 billion annually, providing much of the rationale for universal varicella vaccination.\u201d In other words, complications and deaths from chicken pox were quite rare, but the \u2018lost productivity\u2019 led them to create the vaccine anyway. The death rate was about 1 in 40,000 pre-vaccine, and most of those were adults or children who are immunocompromised.\n\nThen there\u2019s flu. First, please read the CDC\u2019s definition of \u201cflu deaths\u201d and how they calculate the numbers. Note that they include any death where flu may have play any role, and not where flu was the primary cause. This means if someone is already extremely sick, and then they get the flu and die, it would be labeled a \u201cflu death.\u201d Also, note how inaccurate their numbers really are. All of this confounds our understanding of how \u201cdeadly\u201d the flu really is.\n\nLots of people are concerned about polio\u2026so what\u2019s the deal there? According to the CDC, when polio is symptomatic, it kills 1 in 1000\u2026on the high side. On the low side, it\u2019s 1 in 50,000. However, it\u2019s assumed that many are asymptomatic. (source)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these numbers are from the pre-vaccine era, so it\u2019s not that we\u2019re seeing vaccines as a \u201cvictim of their own success.\u201d These are the real death rates we\u2019d see if we stopped vaccinating \u2014 although possibly less since medical science has advanced since the early to mid 1900s.\n\nIn other words\u2026none of these diseases are really all that deadly.\n\nThis is rather silly\u2026. Children are only contagious if they have run across a disease. They are not born carrying all the diseases.\n\nMost people are concerned because some diseases are contagious even if you are not symptomatic (or not yet), and they are worried that an unvaccinated child could be sick or getting sick.\n\nUnfortunately, sharing illnesses in this manner is a fact of life, and can happen to anyone, vaccinated or not. See point #4 that explains that \u201cantivaxxers aren\u2019t bringing the diseases back,\u201d and point #1 for why these disease aren\u2019t that serious anyway.\n\nPlease also note: contrary to popular belief, measles is not contagious until a person displays symptoms. From the CDC: \u201cMeasles virus is shed from the nasopharynx beginning with the prodrome until 3\u20134 days after rash onset.\u201d \u2018Prodrome\u2019 means when symptoms like fever, cough, and weakness begin, but before the rash starts. If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home, and you will not spread anything!\n\n#3: Herd immunity! We must protect the young, the old, and the weak\n\nIt sounds great! We should protect those who cannot protect themselves! And, I agree\u2026we should protect them, by staying home when we\u2019re sick. That would go a long way.\n\nBut this idea of herd immunity \u2014 that vaccines don\u2019t work unless everyone\u2019s getting them. It\u2019s just not true. Look at the point below, which explains that vaccination rates haven\u2019t changed substantially in the last 25 years, yet diseases have increased. Herd immunity had nothing to do with why people were \u201cprotected.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that when it comes to herd immunity, the theory is that the entire population has to be covered at high rates. In 2014, most adults had coverage rates of 9 \u2013 45%. (source) The adult population doesn\u2019t and never has had \u201cherd immunity\u201d level coverage.\n\nEssentially, it\u2019s a nice theory, but there\u2019s no evidence that we\u2019ve ever had anything approaching \u201cherd immunity\u201d coverage rates in the general population, or that fluctuating vaccination rates have anything to do with disease rates.\n\n#4: Antivaxxers are the reason these diseases are coming back\n\nNot really. If you take a look at this graph, pertussis cases have been on the rise since 1990, when they switched to using an acellular vaccine instead of whole-cell pertussis. It just isn\u2019t as effective \u2014 but the whole-cell version was causing too many negative reactions. Besides, according to this study, vaccine refusal has nothing to do with pertussis cases.\n\nIn 2000, 94% of 2-year-olds had 3 DTaP shots. (source) In 2005, it\u2019s 95%. (source) In 2010, it\u2019s 94%. (source) In 2014, the most recent year available, it\u2019s 94%. (source) So\u2026there\u2019s no appreciable difference in vaccination rates, which means there\u2019s no association between lower vaccination rates (not happening) and increasing cases of pertussis.\n\nWhen we look at the MMR, we find a similar pattern. In 2000, 89% of 2-year-olds had an MMR (source), in 2005 it\u2019s 90% (source), in 2010 it\u2019s 89% (source), and in 2014 it\u2019s 89% (source). Again, no appreciable difference in vaccination rates. So if measles was \u201celiminated\u201d in 2000 and is making a resurgence now, it\u2019s not because of a change in vaccination rates.\n\nJust for fun, I looked at the vaccination coverage rates from 1995, when many of us were kids. MMR in 2-year-olds was 87%, and 3 DTaPs was 92%. (source) Both were lower than today\u2019s kids\u2026so no. \u201cAnti-vaxxers\u201d are not bringing diseases back.\n\nWhat steady vaccine coverage rates, and increasing disease rates actually points to is vaccine failure. Researchers already know that the MMR coverage isn\u2019t lasting, and have suggested adding a third at college age. If something doesn\u2019t work\u2026why would we want to use it more?\n\nFor example, recent mumps outbreaks on college campuses have been nearly 100% fully vaccinated students. (In this study, 98%.) In fact, several students who received a third MMR still got mumps.\n\nThis has nothing at all to do with \u201canti-vaxxers.\u201d And pointing the finger is an attempt to take attention away from the failure of the vaccine program.\n\nAccording to the data shared in the previous points, vaccines do seem to temporarily reduce rates of infection in some populations. But, the effect doesn\u2019t last (in an individual or at a population level) and, despite high levels of vaccine coverage, vaccines begin to fail and diseases come back.\n\nA 1991 study theorized that protection from measles might last about 15 years (this was a fairly small study). It also noted that a second dose didn\u2019t create additional immunity \u2014 which is why adding a third is ridiculous. In the 60s and 70s, a single dose was assumed to be life long! We now know it may not even last the 15 years.\n\nAdditionally, in a 2013 study, it was discovered that maternal antibodies passed to babies lasted about half as long if the mothers had been vaccinated, vs. having had wild disease. This places babies at increased risk when they\u2019re most vulnerable to infection.\n\nEssentially, vaccine-induced immunity is inferior and, in the long run, doesn\u2019t really work.\n\n#6: The vaccine-autism link has been thoroughly debunked and that doctor lost his license/is in jail\n\nThis is my favorite story! It\u2019s like a giant game of telephone; it\u2019s been passed around so many times that most don\u2019t even know the truth.\n\n\u201cThat doctor\u201d is Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a gastroenterologist who lived in England. He now lives in the US. He did lose his medical license, but is not and has never been to jail. Many of the allegations against him are and were false. You can read more about him HERE.\n\nThe original paper in question was about the diagnosis of colitis in children with autism \u2014 not about vaccines. It was parents who reported they thought there was an association between the MMR and their children\u2019s health issues. Dr. Wakefield concluded that there may be a link, but that further research was needed to understand it. He recommended splitting the vaccine into three separate ones and giving them a year apart, instead of using the combo shot, until the matter could be resolved. He did not recommend against using vaccines.\n\nSo, in the last 20 years, has the vaccine-autism connection been thoroughly studied?\n\nThis 2015 study looks only at receiving or not receiving the MMR vaccine \u2014 but not at any other vaccine. Children could be fully vaccinated except for the MMR. This 2001 study looks at only the MMR, and doesn\u2019t even publish results \u2014 only says \u201cwe\u2019re going to study this.\u201d This study looks at only the MMR again. A survey-based study (not robust) concluded there was no association between health outcomes and vaccination status. Other surveys have found differently.\n\nOn the other hand\u2026\n\u2022 A 2011 study says that there is a relationship between vaccines and autism.\n\u2022 A 2009 study concludes that \u201coveruse of vaccines\u201d causes autism.\n\u2022 A 2013 study says that vaccines may trigger an underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and lead to autism.\n\u2022 A 2002 study shows an \u201cinappropriate response\u201d to MMR may cause autism.\n\u2022 A 2007 study shows that prenatal mercury exposure may cause autism.\n\u2022 A 2011 study shows that aluminum in vaccines may cause autism.\n\nBasically\u2026it hasn\u2019t been thoroughly studied. We have a lot of questions still to ask. We need a comprehensive study of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated on total health outcomes in a developed country. (All we have are tiny studies from third-world countries or survey-based studies in developed countries.) There\u2019s certainly enough data to warrant caution and further study!\n\n#7: Getting lots of vaccines at once is fine; babies run across more antigens just by playing\n\nThis is missing the point; no one is concerned about the number of antigens. In fact, they\u2019re a lot lower today than they used to. Previous versions of vaccines are no longer used because the antigen load was high enough to cause the disease it was supposed to prevent, in some cases.\n\n#8: Vaccines contain less formaldehyde than a pear and less aluminum than breastmilk\n\nThis may be true. The government says it is. (source) We\u2019re not that concerned about formaldehyde in trace amounts, as it isn\u2019t lethal until around 12g, far more than is in a vaccine \u2014 although a few hundred milligrams or less could cause some soreness or side effects. (source)\n\nHowever, aluminum is very concerning. Ingestion is not the same as injection. A 2016 study suggests more safety tests are needed. A 2009 study points to aluminum causing brain damage. A 2015 study shows that injected aluminum persists in the brain.\n\nFurther, a 1999 study suggests a causal relationship between gelatin-containing vaccines and the development of gelatin allergy.\n\nAnd, a 2014 study shows that vaccines cultured in human fetal tissue contain \u201cunacceptably high levels of DNA contamination.\u201d Didn\u2019t know that vaccines are cultured in human fetal tissue? Some are. They\u2019re called \u201chuman diploid cells.\u201d (source)\n\nWhile we\u2019re not concerned with all the ingredients in the vaccines, there are some seriously concerning ones. We shouldn\u2019t avoid or dismiss these concerns so quickly.\n\n#9: Vaccines boost the immune system overall; without them, a child can never be fully healthy\n\nSorry, but vaccines aren\u2019t designed to work that way. They\u2019re only designed to help prevent the person from becoming sick with specific illnesses. They aren\u2019t overall immune boosters, and they can\u2019t prevent diseases other than the one(s) they were designed to prevent.\n\nThe human immune system is meant to develop without vaccines. In fact, vaccines can change the way the immune system develops, and not necessarily in beneficial ways. (source) Vaccines may also increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. (source, source)\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive look at all the research available surrounding vaccines. There is so much more to this topic. But, it\u2019s enough to get you started if you\u2019re new to researching it, and certainly enough to show that there isn\u2019t a simple answer to the question. It\u2019s not \u201cvaccines are safe and effective, the end.\u201d\n\nI hope you\u2019ll take the time to read through all the sources I linked and continue researching until all your questions have been answered. This is an incredibly important decision, so don\u2019t take it lightly!\n\nHow do you respond to \u201cshould I vaccinate?\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://modernalternativemama.com/vaccine-education/", "https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/189/Supplement_1/S1/820569", "https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2016.pdf", "https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/hcp.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806663/", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt12-polio.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474890/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6501a1.htm", "https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.png", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056554/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/tables/9900/24months_iap.pdf", "https://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/coverage/nis/nis_iap.asp?fmt=v&rpt=tab09_24mo_iap&qtr=Q1/2005-Q4/2005", "https://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/coverage/nis/nis_iap3.asp?fmt=v&rpt=tab09_24mo_iap&qtr=Q1/2010-Q4/2010", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/tables/14/tab09_24mo_iap_2014.pdf", "https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/vaccines_nis/00/24months_iap.pdf", "https://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/coverage/nis/nis_iap.asp?fmt=v&rpt=tab09_24mo_iap&qtr=Q1/2005-Q4/2005", "https://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/coverage/nis/nis_iap3.asp?fmt=v&rpt=tab09_24mo_iap&qtr=Q1/2010-Q4/2010", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/tables/14/tab09_24mo_iap_2014.pdf", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/tables/95/tab9-24months_iap.pdf", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877026", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1934235", "https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/208/1/10/796786", "http://vaxxedthemovie.com/andrew-wakefield-biography/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25898051", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC29106/", "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003140", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057555/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21623535", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364648/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697751/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774468/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878266/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339848", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933322", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454560", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17674242", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993250", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995277", "https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/vaccine_ingredients/index.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19999605", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26948677", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819810/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318414/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9949325", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26103708", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12417433", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5607155/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26031899"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
