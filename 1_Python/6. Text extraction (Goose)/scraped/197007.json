The social media platform locked the National File\u2018s Twitter account for a 12-hour period. Twitter later claimed that the move was done \u201cin error\u201d and the website was granted access to its account once more.\n\nAccording to the National File, the temporary restriction stemmed from its report about tweets from a woman named Tami Burages. The woman claimed her 13-year-old nephew Jacob Clynick died after his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.\n\nBurages tweeted that the initial autopsy results on Clynick showed an \u201cenlarged heart \u2026 [with] some fluid surrounding it.\u201d She added that her nephew had no known health problems and was not on any medication. \u201cShould any innocent child be a sacrificial lamb in this endeavor? There are moral, ethical and health questions that need to be answered. If Jacob had not received the second shot, we believe he would be alive today,\u201d Burages continued.\n\nLater, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the National File lockout was done in error and the website had been allowed to access to its account again. According to the social media site, the temporary 12-hour ban stemmed from the website allegedly violating Twitter rules on \u201cspreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nWhile the National File regained access to its account, it noted that Twitter suspended its reporter Jack Hadfield. The news site added that Hadfield was blocked from the social media platform \u201cfor celebrating Twitter\u2019s decision to reverse the suspension.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, National File Editor-In-Chief Tom Pappert said: \u201cTwitter\u2019s censorship here is as repugnant as it is ridiculous. We published a report containing direct quotes from a woman who \u2013 using Twitter \u2013 expressed concern about the death of her 13-year-old nephew \u2026 after he received the [Pfizer/BioNTech] COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nHe added that the social media site headed by Jack Dorsey \u201cis attempting to censor news outlets for the crime of reporting on the concerns of a recently bereaved family member.\u201d Pappert then concluded his statement: \u201cIt is very unfortunate that Twitter would attempt to prevent this family from sharing its truth and its concerns about the [Pfizer/BioNTech] COVID-19 vaccine only days after [Clynick\u2019s] untimely and heartbreaking death.\u201d\n\nTwitter in cahoots with Big Pharma with censorship of the truth about COVID-19 vaccines\n\nTwitter\u2019s lockout of the National File following its report of Clynick\u2019s death was not the first time it suppressed voices questioning the COVID-19 narrative. In early June 2021, the platform suspended the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) after the organization announced it will publish more emails from top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. Emails from the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) were made public following a Freedom of Information Act request sent by mainstream media outlets Washington Post and BuzzFeed.\n\nICAN was suspended twice on June 3 after it tweeted that it would drop \u201c3,000 new pages of \u2026 Fauci emails\u201d that provided \u201cfurther insight\u201d on the NIAID director\u2019s actions on COVID-19, vaccine safety and more. Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin posted a screenshot of a message ICAN received on her Twitter account. According to the message, ICAN\u2019s Twitter account had been locked due to its June 3 tweet allegedly flouting the site\u2019s rules on \u201cspreading misleading and potentially harmful information\u201d about the pandemic.\n\nThe next day, Twitter walked back on its suspension of the informed consent advocacy group. National File reached out to the social media site for its comment on ICAN\u2019s ban. Just like in the instance with Burages, a Twitter spokesperson claimed the \u201cenforcement action\u201d on ICAN was done \u201cin error.\u201d They added that the suspension has been reversed, with ICAN having their tweets and account functionality restored.\n\nICAN Founder Del Bigtree told National File: \u201cI\u2019m glad that they\u2019ve done what is correct, but when the kneejerk reaction is to censor simply a factual statement \u2013 which is emails are going to be forthcoming \u2013 it really makes you have to question what type of infrastructure [Twitter is] working with. How does that mistake get made, and how does it get made twice?\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s censorship also extended to progressive Democrats who dared to question COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine passports. Former Clinton administration adviser Dr. Naomi Wolf, who was critical of these two, saw herself being suspended on the social media platform. During an interview with LifeSiteNews, she claimed that Twitter did not provide a reason for her suspension.\n\nWolf said: \u201cTwitter did not inform me why I was suspended. [The] accounts in the news stories that make claims that I was suspended for \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019 and \u2018anti-vaxx\u2019 [information] are not correct.\u201d On the other hand, Twitter explained that the former campaign aide and lifelong progressive Democrat shared \u201cmisinformation about COVID-19 vaccines\u201d that led to her suspension.\n\nShe nevertheless warned: \u201c[This] systematic de-platforming is very terrifying for democracy. [It\u2019s] extremely disturbing to see Twitter \u2026 systematically de-platforming conservative voices.\u201d\n\nVisit Censorship.news to read more articles about Big Tech companies suppressing voices that go against the COVID-19 narrative.", "opengraph": {"title": "Twitter locks news site\u2019s account after it reported a vaccinated boy\u2019s death", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2021-06-28-twitter-locks-news-site-following-vaccination-death.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "Twitter locked the account of conservative news website National File after it reported on a tweet about the death of a vaccinated 13-year-old.
