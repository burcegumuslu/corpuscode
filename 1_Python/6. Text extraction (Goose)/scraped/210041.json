Following this announcement, the FDA stated it would add a fact sheet warning about this adverse effect \u2013 but insisted that the benefits of getting the shot still outweigh the potential risks.\n\nConcerned medical freedom advocates are comparing the FDA\u2019s decision to keep these investigational drugs on the market \u2013 despite over 1,200 documented cases of post-jab heart inflammation \u2013 to the FDA\u2019s decision back in April 2021 to put a temporary pause on the J&J shot after (an initial) six cases of a rare blood clotting disorder were reported. Now, even the creator of mRNA technology is expressing serious concerns over the safety of these jabs for younger people.\n\nCENSORED: Interview with mRNA inventor over safety concerns for COVID injection deleted from YouTube\n\nRobert Malone, MD, is the inventor of mRNA injections and is credited as one of the world\u2019s most foremost experts on the experimental technology currently being used by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna. Recently, a video featuring Dr. Malone and his thoughts on these products was deleted from YouTube.\n\nThe doctor was later interviewed on June 23 by reporter Tucker Carlson of FOX News. In this interview, Dr. Malone had the chance to reiterate many of his concerns about the FDA\u2019s and CDC\u2019s continued insistence that these injections are worth the risk for young adults.\n\n\u201cThe government is not being transparent with us,\u201d Dr. Malone says, citing a lack of \u201crigorously\u201d tested data assessing the known risks of these injections as one of his main objections to young people getting the shots. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the information we need to make a reasonable decision.\u201d\n\nDr. Malone goes on to claim that the CDC has not performed appropriate risk-benefit analyses \u2013 suggesting that the government\u2019s claim that the benefits outweigh the risks for this young cohort of Americans is simply not based on science.\n\nRegarding whether the shots are truly indicated in younger Americans, the mRNA expert puts it bluntly: \u201cI can say that the risk-benefit ratio for those 18 and below doesn\u2019t justify [injections], and there\u2019s a pretty good chance that it doesn\u2019t justify [injection] in these very young adults.\u201d\n\nThe swift Big Tech censorship of Dr. Malone and people like him leads to the question: does the propagandized message to \u201cfollow the science\u201d only apply to science that supports the pro-jab agenda?\n\nStudents take a stand: Young adults around the U.S. prepare to bring suit against universities mandating experimental injections\n\nAs of this writing, children as young as 12 can be given the unapproved Pfizer shot in the United States. In some states, including South Carolina, Oregon, Washington, and Tennessee, parental consent for this shot is either not required or can be waived by a doctor.\n\nIn his FOX News interview, Dr. Malone points out that \u201cpeople have the right to decide whether to accept [injections] or not, especially since these are experimental [injections]. This is a fundamental right having to do with clinical research ethics.\u201d\n\nIn this spirit, thousands of college-aged students from around the country are taking a stand against injection mandates from their academic institutions, including coeds at Indiana University.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, given that busy college students have other things they should be spending their energy on other than having to advocate for their medical freedoms.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Concerns Raised Over Safety Of Multiple COVID Jabs | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Inventor of mRNA technology expresses serious concerns over safety of Pfizer and Moderna COVID jabs.
