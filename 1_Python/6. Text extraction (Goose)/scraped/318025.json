Moreover, the Australian Federal Government entertains discussions with the World Health Organization to implement a global vaccine passport.\nThe basis for social division across every aspect of life from the public sphere to private life, even driving wedges in between family members, the distinct lines drawn were remarkable. While some segments of society (the majority) believed in the collective necessity for mandates, others were highly skeptical about an overreaching state apparatus. These critics, for example, cautioned that the vaccines were not neutralizing vaccines, meaning they did not stop transmission. And formal government mandates for a vaccine that doesn&rsquo;t stop transmission to third parties are certainly ethically questionable."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
