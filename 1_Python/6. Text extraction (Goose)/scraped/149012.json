They blame the murky brown water flowing out of the faucets of thousands of resident\u2019s on a malfunction in a filter system.\n\nThey reported that stainless steel tanks replaced two aluminum tanks that failed two years ago and eventually caused a breakdown in a filter system. Brian Wheeler, Director of St. Cloud Interim Utilities, said:\n\u2022 None \u2018Erin Brockovich\u2019 Carcinogen in Tap Water of More than 200 Million Americans \u2013 Check Your City Here\n\nFrustrated residents, who shared stories of orange stained tubs, sinks, and clothing, met Tuesday night and demanded to know what the city is going to do for them while it attempts to clear the sediment out of the distribution system. One resident said:\n\nThere has been no word from city officials on whether residents will be offered any adjustment on their water bill, or if the city will begin supplying them with free, bottled water. The city, who maintains the particles in the water are not a health threat, has said they will consider both possibilities. Wheeler said:\n\nThe city explained to frustrated residents that they feel confident in their latest effort to clear the pipes by pushing ice through them to collect sediment. The process, known as \u201cice pigging,\u201d forces the debris out, but can take weeks.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NBC: Dark Water Pouring Out of Faucets in St. Cloud, Florida", "description": "Frustrated St. Cloud residents shared stories of orange stained tubs, sinks, and clothing, and demand to know what is wrong with their water", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/nbc-dark-water-pouring-out-of-faucets-in-st-cloud-florida/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:tag": "toxic water", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2020-02-13T22:14:19-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-12T21:19:59-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-02-12T21:19:59-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_410324422.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_410324422.jpg", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "667"}, "tags": ["Health", "News"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"St. Cloud water problems\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxX17Ia1QpI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxX17Ia1QpI?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/florida-city-does-dangerous-practice-to-water-famous-expert-theyre-lying-to-the-community/", "https://www.wesh.com/article/st-cloud-water-concerns/30883910", "https://healthnutnews.com/erin-brockovich-carcinogen-in-tap-water-of-more-than-200-million-americans-check-your-city-here/", "https://www.wesh.com/article/st-cloud-water-concerns/30883910", "https://www.aquatruwater.com/?src=affiliate&aid=47215&c=HNN", "https://healthnutnews.com/erin-brockovich-slams-florida-officials-over-algae-crisis-do-your-damn-jobs/", "https://healthnutnews.com/the-next-flint-water-crisis-in-a-small-michigan-city-one-company-who-dumped-toxic-waste/", "https://www.wesh.com/article/st-cloud-water-concerns/30883910", "tg://msg?text=NBC%3A%20Dark%20Water%20Pouring%20Out%20of%20Faucets%20in%20St.%20Cloud%2C%20Florida - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fnbc-dark-water-pouring-out-of-faucets-in-st-cloud-florida%2F", "mailto:?subject=NBC%3A%20Dark%20Water%20Pouring%20Out%20of%20Faucets%20in%20St.%20Cloud%2C%20Florida&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fnbc-dark-water-pouring-out-of-faucets-in-st-cloud-florida%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-02-13T22:14:19-05:00"}
