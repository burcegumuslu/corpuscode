Faber, who worked in the network as a producer, was terminated in September 2021. Williams, who was fired in the same month as Faber, later joined Fox Sports as a commentator.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit argued that Disney, in its role as a \u201cstate actor,\u201d is subject to the Constitution\u2019s \u201cequal protection clause.\u201d Lawyers for Faber and Williams wrote: \u201cThe Constitution provides that the government \u2013 and state actors alike \u2013 cannot take life, liberty or property without due process and equal protection of the law.\u201d\n\nThe complaint further argued that the termination of both Faber and Williams, which coincided with President Joe Biden\u2019s announcement of a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private companies, was \u201cmore than just symbolic\u201d as it was \u201cpart of a very orchestrated and choreographed partnership.\u201d\n\nThe California-based entertainment company owns 80 percent of ESPN, with the remaining 20 percent owned by Hearst Communications.\n\nMoreover, Faber and Williams\u2019 lawsuit referenced a White House meeting attended by then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek less than a week after Biden announced his vaccine mandate. Chapek mandating COVID-19 injections for Disney employees served as a \u201cclear and obvious response\u201d to the president\u2019s demand, it added. Originally taking over his predecessor Bob Iger, Chapek stepped down as CEO in November 2022 only to be replaced by Iger himself.\n\nThe complaint also mentioned that in the course of acting as an arm of the Biden administration, Disney \u2013 and by extension ESPN \u2013 infringed on the religious rights of employees. It cited how the network rejected the application for religious exemption filed by both plaintiffs.\n\nOther former employees sue Disney over vaccine mandates\n\nThe two former ESPN employees are not the only ones who challenged Disney\u2019s vaccine mandate in court.\n\nAccording to a report by NBC affiliate channel WESH 2, seven former employees sued Disney for \u201cdiscrimination\u201d under the Florida Civil Rights Act. Two of the plaintiffs, Cheron Hayes and Seth Schmidt, claimed the company rejected their applications for religious exemption to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate \u2013 leading to their termination.

She lamented: \u201cI thought I\u2019d found the company I would retire from. So for them to hit me with this just for a shot and for them to literally say \u2018No shot, no job\u2019 \u2026 was very humiliating.\u201d\n\nSchmitt also suffered the same fate even though he had worked or 11 years at the Disney Hollywood Studios in Florida\u2019s Disney World theme park. \u201cMy manager said it\u2019s not because of the job,\u201d he told WESH 2. \u201c\u2018You do a great job. But because of our policies, we have to let you go.\u2019 It just felt disheartening.\u201d\n\nRachel Rodriguez, an attorney representing the seven plaintiffs, said the law is clearly on her clients\u2019 side.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be overstated that the problems here have to do with discrimination under long-standing law,\u201d she said, adding that Disney \u201cviolated the privacy rights\u201d of employees by mandating them to get the COVID-19 vaccine under threat of termination.\n\nWatch Disney employee Nick Caturano discuss his and his colleagues\u2019 fight against the company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate on \u201cLawfare with Tom Renz.\u201d\n\nThis video is from the BrighteonTV channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nVaccine industry social influence document reveals attempted bribery of \u2018key social influencers\u2019 such as Disney / Marvel, ESPN, Oprah and a CNN reporter.", "opengraph": {"title": "Lawsuit claims Disney served as \u201cstate actor\u201d in implementing COVID vaccine mandate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2023-01-17-disney-state-actor-implementing-covid-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "A lawsuit filed against The Walt Disney Company accused the media giant of acting as an arm of the Biden administration in implementing Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandates.
