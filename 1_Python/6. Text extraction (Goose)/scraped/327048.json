In the U.S., more than one-third (38% to 45%) of adults continue to decline the unlicensed, Emergency Use Authorization injections, despite a marketing blitz that has included both carrots (ranging from the chance to win cash payments to a free order of fries) and sticks (such as nasty calls to \u201cget personal\u201d and \u201cshun\u201d the unvaccinated).\n\nAlthough some of the uninjected tell pollsters they plan to eventually get the vaccine, a solid minority remains committed to never doing so. The same pattern appears to hold true globally: Roughly one-third of adults worldwide said they will not take a COVID shot.\n\nWhile social and behavioral science researchers apply \u201csoft science\u201d techniques in an attempt to maneuver vaccine confidence into more acquiescent territory, bench scientists have a different option potentially waiting in the wings \u2014 genetically engineered vaccines that \u201cmove through populations in the same way as communicable diseases,\u201d spreading on their own \u201cfrom host to host.\u201d\n\nIn theory, self-spreading vaccines (also referred to as self-disseminating or autonomous) can be designed to be either transferable (\u201crestricted to a single round of transmission\u201d) or transmissible (\u201ccapable of indefinite transmission).\u201d\n\nVaccine scientists concede transmissible vaccines \u201care still not mainstream, but the revolution in genome engineering poises them to become so.\u201d\n\nThe makers of self-disseminating vaccines use recombinant vector technology to build genetic material from a target pathogen onto the \u201cchassis\u201d of a viral vector deemed \u201cbenign,\u201d \u201cinnocuous\u201d or \u201cavirulent.\u201d This is similar to the viral vector approach used to produce the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca COVID vaccines.\n\nFor Johns Hopkins, the appeal of vaccines that are intentionally engineered to be self-disseminating seems obvious. The university\u2019s Center for Health Security made its case explicit in a 2018 report, \u201cTechnologies to Address Global Catastrophic Biological Risks.\u201d The report stated, \u201cThese vaccines could dramatically increase vaccine coverage in human \u2026 populations without requiring each individual to be inoculated.\u201d\n\nFurther spelling out the utilitarian implications of self-disseminating vaccines, the report\u2019s authors stated, \u201conly a small number of vaccinated individuals would be required to confer protection to a larger susceptible population, thus eliminating the need for mass vaccination operations.\u201d\n\nFrom a programmatic standpoint, this strategy would have the advantage of being \u201ccheaper than vaccinating everyone by hand.\u201d Perhaps even more significantly, however, it would override one of the \u201cthorny ethical questions\u201d that mass vaccination programs routinely wrestle with: informed consent.\n\nAs the university\u2019s Center for Health Security briefly acknowledged in its report, self-disseminating vaccines would essentially make it impossible for \u201cthose to whom the vaccine subsequently spreads\u201d to provide informed consent at all.\n\nWriting in 2020 in Nature Ecology & Evolution, researchers observed that viral zoonoses (diseases theorized to jump from animals to humans) have become an entrenched part of the \u201cglobal mindset\u201d and a central element of the pandemic-obsessed global health zeitgeist.\n\nDespite SARS-CoV-2\u2019s unproven zoonotic origins (cast into doubt by figures such as Robert Redfield, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the past year\u2019s coronavirus hype has helped reinforce the popular perception that wildlife populations represent a menacing cauldron of latent viral threats \u2014 requiring only the right set of circumstances to spring into humanity-endangering action.\n\nParlaying the COVID moment into a convenient scientific opportunity, researchers suggest that the purported \u201cfailure to contain the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic\u201d furnishes a rationale for accelerating the rollout of self-disseminating vaccines. As some journalists have phrased the question du jour, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if wild animals could be inoculated against the various diseases they host so that those microbes never get a chance to spread to humans?\u201d\n\nTransmissible-vaccine research also has ascended the list of funding priorities for government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and, reportedly, donors such as the Gates Foundation.\n\nAt least officially, the primary focus of self-spreading vaccine research has thus far been on wildlife populations. Although the practice of direct wildlife vaccination (for example, against rabies) has been around since the 1960s, it is the longstanding efforts to develop sterilizing vaccines in wildlife (euphemistically called \u201cimmunocontraception\u201c), as well as recent advances in genetic engineering, that \u201chave provided a foundation for transmissible-vaccine research.\u201d\n\nResearchers explain how the targeting of wildlife reservoirs is intended to work:\n\n\u201cThe idea, essentially, is to vaccinate a small proportion of a [wildlife] population through direct inoculation. These so-called founders will then passively spread the vaccine to other animals they encounter either by touch, sex, nursing, or breathing the same air. Gradually, these interactions could build up population-level immunity.\u201d\n\nWhen put to the test by Spanish researchers in a limited field trial in rabbits, about 50% of the unvaccinated rabbits developed antibodies after being housed with vaccinated rabbits who had received a transmissible vaccine either via injection or orally. When the researchers assessed second-generation transmission (that is, development of antibodies in another batch of rabbits moved in with the first batch of unvaccinated rabbits), the transmission rate was much lower (two of 24 rabbits).\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nAs the Johns Hopkins report made clear in 2018, there is no technical reason why the self-spreading approach could not be applied to humans. The authors admitted to \u201cseveral big challenges,\u201d however, including the fact that autonomous vaccines (as mentioned above) would render informed consent a moot point and would make it impossible to screen individuals for contraindications such as allergies.\n\nAccording to Johns Hopkins and others, another major challenge is the \u201cnot insignificant risk of the vaccine virus reverting to wild-type virulence,\u201d creating an opportunity for the vaccines to propagate disease rather than prevent it.\n\nIn fact, the world is already familiar with this phenomenon in the form of oral polio vaccines. Though not \u201cintentionally designed that way,\u201d oral polio vaccines are considered \u201ca little bit transmissible\u201d and are acknowledged to cause polio.\n\nHopkins\u2019 researchers pointedly characterized the reversion challenge as \u201cboth a medical risk and a public perception risk.\u201d Another Catch-22 articulated in the university\u2019s report is that while reversion risks could perhaps be lessened by engineering the vaccines to be more \u201cweakly transmissible,\u201d this could defeat the purpose of getting vaccines to \u201cgo\u201d on their own.\n\nOn the other hand, the two scientists who are most strongly promoting transmissible vaccines argue that \u201ceven \u2026 where reversion is frequent, [their] performance will often substantially exceed that of conventional, directly administered vaccines.\u201d\n\nThese same authors have also developed models suggesting that starting the transmissible ball rolling with direct vaccination of newborns could be particularly impactful.\n\nIn September 2020, two researchers writing in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists agreed that self-spreading vaccines may have significant downsides and could \u201centail serious risks,\u201d particularly given that scientists lose control of their creation once released. They noted, \u201cWhile it may turn out to be technically feasible to fight emerging infectious diseases \u2026 with self-spreading viruses, and while the benefits may be significant, how does one weigh those benefits against what may be even greater risks?\u201d They outlined several additional questions:\n\u2022 Who makes the decisions about the \u201cwhere and when\u201d of the vaccines\u2019 release?\n\u2022 What happens when there are \u201cunexpected outcomes\u201d and \u201cunintended consequences\u201d such as mutation, species-jumping or border-crossing? About unintended consequences, the two authors added, \u201cThere always are.\u201d\n\u2022 What about bioweapons and \u201cdual use\u201d risks \u2014 that is, using the technology to \u201cdeliberately cause harm\u201d rather than prevent disease? Advances in pharmacogenomics, drug development and personalized medicine, the two noted, could enable \u201cultra-targeted biological warfare.\u201d\n\nOn the latter point, the Bulletin authors drew readers\u2019 attention to immunocontraception efforts in animals as well as an infamous example of \u201cweaponized biology\u201d against humans in apartheid-era South Africa, called Project Coast, which sought \u2014 reportedly unsuccessfully \u2014 to develop an \u201cinfertility \u2018vaccine\u2019 to be used on black women without their knowledge.\u201d\n\nOther scientists have made an even more direct case against transmissible vaccines, arguing the risks of autonomously spreading vaccines do, in fact, \u201cfar outweigh potential benefits.\u201d Risks, in their view, include \u201cthe unpredictability of mutations of the virus, the inability to safely test at a large scale and the grave potential threat to biosecurity.\u201d\n\nWhen measles, rather than COVID, was dominating the headlines a couple years ago, the unvaccinated were heavily scapegoated for apparent outbreaks. This non-evidence-based finger-pointing (used to usher in draconian new vaccine mandates), ignored the well-documented \u201cphenomenon of measles infection spread by MMR (live measles-mumps-rubella vaccine), which has been known about for decades\u201d and has resulted in \u201cdetectable measles infection in the vast majority of those who receive it.\u201d\n\nThe experimental Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines use new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology rather than the traditional live-virus technology featured in vaccines like the MMR, and thus, we are told, they cannot produce the same type of \u201cshedding.\u201d\n\nHowever, many unvaccinated individuals are reporting unusual symptoms or illness after spending time in proximity to COVID-vaccinated individuals. Pointing to Pfizer\u2019s protocol acknowledging the possibility of exposure via inhalation or skin contact with vaccinated individuals, concerned health professionals have raised the question of whether some novel form of shedding is occurring.\n\nSome of the people raising these questions have pointed to the September 2020 article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, subtitled, \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong?\u201d By May 2021, the Bulletin\u2019s editors, apparently uncomfortable with the attention the September article had attracted, were trying to distance themselves by stating the Bulletin\u2019s content was being misused to further conspiracy theories about \u201chighly effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nWhether the COVID injections are \u201cself-spreading\u201d in any sense of the word is a question that cannot currently be answered. However, there is at least one plausible molecular mechanism that could explain the observed vaccinated-to-unvaccinated \u201cshedding\u201d effects.\n\nGreenMedInfo\u2019s Sayer Ji explains that \u201chorizontal information transfer within biological systems [is] mediated by extracellular vesicles, which include a virus-like phenomenon known as microvesicle shedding and/or exosome-mediated transfer of nucleic acids.\u201d Citing a 2017 peer-reviewed study on the \u201cbiology and biogenesis of shed microvesicles,\u201d Ji states:\n\n\u201c[I]t is possible that [mRNA vaccines] do, in fact, contribute to microvesicle shedding, which represents an even greater, more persistent threat than live-cell vaccine shedding when it comes to the persistent biological impact the vaccinated can have on the unvaccinated.\u201d\n\nWhat is even more certain is that scientists themselves do not have all the answers. Some may wish to believe in the possibility of simply genetically engineering a vaccine \u201cin ways that thwart its ability to evolve into something nasty.\u201d But others note \u201cthe inevitability of evolutionary change resulting from [transmissible vaccines\u2019] ability to self-replicate and generate extended chains of transmission.\u201d\n\nTechno-thriller author Michael Crichton predicted in 2002 that with the advent of nanotechnology and other technological innovations, the pace of evolutionary change was likely to be \u201cextremely rapid.\u201d Crichton cautioned, \u201chuman beings have a poor record of addressing the hazards of new technologies as they arrive.\u201d\n\nRead more at: ChildrenHealthDefense.org and Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u2018Self-spreading\u2019 vaccines pose multiple risks to society \u2014 including the end of informed consent", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2021-06-09-self-spreading-vaccines-pose-multiple-risks-to-society.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "In October 2019, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security co-sponsored the \u201cpandemic exercise,\u201d\u00a0Event 201.

The authors admitted to \u201c<a href=\"https://jhsphcenterforhealthsecurity.s3.amazonaws.com/181009-gcbr-tech-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several big challenges</a>,\u201d however, including the fact that autonomous vaccines (as mentioned above) would render informed consent a moot point and would make it impossible to screen individuals for contraindications such as allergies.</p>\n<p>According to Johns Hopkins and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/contagious-vaccine-virus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">others</a>, another major challenge is the \u201cnot insignificant risk of the vaccine virus\u00a0<a href=\"https://jhsphcenterforhealthsecurity.s3.amazonaws.com/181009-gcbr-tech-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reverting to wild-type virulence</a>,\u201d creating an opportunity for the vaccines to propagate disease rather than prevent it.</p>\n<p>In fact, the world is already familiar with this phenomenon in the form of oral polio vaccines. Though not \u201cintentionally designed that way,\u201d oral polio vaccines are considered \u201c<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/contagious-vaccine-virus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a little bit transmissible</a>\u201d\u00a0and are acknowledged to\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/the-polio-and-non-polio-shell-game-in-africa-and-the-u-s-2020-update/\">cause</a>\u00a0polio.</p>\n<p>Hopkins\u2019 researchers pointedly characterized the reversion challenge as \u201cboth a medical risk and a\u00a0<a href=\"https://jhsphcenterforhealthsecurity.s3.amazonaws.com/181009-gcbr-tech-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public perception risk</a>.\u201d Another Catch-22 articulated in the university\u2019s report is that while reversion risks could perhaps be lessened by engineering the vaccines to be more \u201c<a href=\"https://jhsphcenterforhealthsecurity.s3.amazonaws.com/181009-gcbr-tech-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weakly transmissible</a>,\u201d this could defeat the purpose of getting vaccines to \u201cgo\u201d on their own.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the two scientists who are most strongly promoting transmissible vaccines argue that \u201ceven \u2026 where reversion is frequent, [their] performance will often\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708430/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">substantially exceed</a>\u00a0that of conventional, directly administered vaccines.\u201d</p>\n<p>These same authors have also developed models suggesting that starting the transmissible ball rolling with direct vaccination of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6492562/\">newborns</a>\u00a0could be particularly impactful.</p>\n<p>In September 2020, two researchers\u00a0<a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2020/09/scientists-are-working-on-vaccines-that-spread-like-a-disease-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing</a>\u00a0in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists agreed that self-spreading vaccines may have significant downsides and could \u201centail serious risks,\u201d particularly given that scientists lose control of their creation once released. They noted, \u201cWhile it may turn out to be technically feasible to fight emerging infectious diseases \u2026 with self-spreading viruses, and while the benefits may be significant, how does one weigh those benefits against what may be even greater risks?\u201d They outlined several\u00a0<a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2020/09/scientists-are-working-on-vaccines-that-spread-like-a-disease-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">additional questions</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who makes the decisions about the \u201cwhere and when\u201d of the vaccines\u2019 release?</li>\n<li>What happens when there are \u201cunexpected outcomes\u201d and \u201cunintended consequences\u201d such as mutation, species-jumping or border-crossing?
