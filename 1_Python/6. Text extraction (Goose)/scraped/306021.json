And we need you to tell us how. Please take our specially-crafted survey to help us better understand your concerns, fears, interests and impressions \u2014 of The Stream and the world.\n\nThe first Spanish study on how the Omicron variant of COVID-19 infects, incubates, and transmits was recently concluded by the Public Health Observatory of Cantabria.\n\nThe findings, which have not yet been peer reviewed, show that the highly infectious variant accounted for nearly half of the infections recorded during the whole pandemic. One reason Omicron has proven so transmissible, researchers discovered, is that the window for transmission is earlier than previous variants.\n\n\u201cHalf of the infections occurred before the onset of symptoms,\u201d researchers said.\n\n\u201cThis would imply that the effectiveness of measures such as screening, rapid testing, or isolation would decrease significantly in the absence of preventive measures such as distance, limiting mass gatherings or social gatherings,\u201d researchers said.\n\nPerhaps the most consequential finding in the research, however, is that vaccines did not appear to reduce the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cVaccinated cases seem to have the same transmission capacity as unvaccinated people,\u201d researchers concluded, according to EITB Radio Televisi\u00f3n P\u00fablica Vasca (the Basque Autonomous Community\u2019s public broadcast service).\n\nThis is a departure from the Delta variant, researchers said, where transmission differences were found in vaccinated households and workplaces.\n\nThe study was based on 622 Omicron cases (and their 1,420 contacts) detected in Cantabria, a region on Spain\u2019s north coast, in December 2021.\n\nThe findings out of Spain are just the latest example of why COVID-19 continues to spread despite human ingenuity and the widespread efforts of central planners to tame the virus.\n\nUnlike previous pandemics, governments around the world took sweeping actions to restrict basic freedoms out of fear of the deadly pathogen. Businesses were closed, speech restricted, free assembly denied, and bodily autonomy was violated.\n\nDespite these efforts the virus, now in its third year, continues to rage, and in many parts of the world governments have been slow to rescind harmful policies despite their ineffectiveness.\n\nTo its credit, parts of Spain have proven much more responsive than other parts of the world.\n\nLast week, public health officials in Catalonia, an autonomous province in northeast Spain, and several other provinces, announced they were scrapping vaccine passports in light of this new evidence.\n\nA committee of scientists told Catalonia\u2019s regional government that because of the nature of Omicron, \u201ca large part of the population is once again susceptible to getting infected whether or not they are vaccinated or have already had the illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe effectiveness of the compulsory use of the COVID certificate is reduced as an extra level of security,\u201d scientists added.\n\nThe requirement to show a COVID passport had been in place since November in Catalonia, the second most-populous community in Spain, with some 7.7 million people. Smaller regions in Spain, such as Cantabria and Asturias, also have reportedly announced they will no longer require COVID passports for people to enter bars, restaurants, and other public spaces.\n\nEuropean media point out that Spain has suffered from widespread Omicron outbreaks even though the country boasts one of the higher vaccination rates in the world.\n\n\u201cDespite high levels of vaccination in Spain where 90.7 percent of people over the age of 12 are fully immunized,\u201d The Local reports, \u201ccoronavirus cases exploded in Spain over the Christmas holidays, giving it one of Europe\u2019s highest incidence rates.\u201d\n\nThe decision to scrap the vaccine passport follows widespread protests in Spain against vaccine passports and mask mandates.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Spain\u2019s First Study on Omicron Finds Vaccinated People Spread COVID at Same Rate as Unvaccinated - The Stream", "description": "Spain\u2019s first study on Omicron by the Public Health Observatory of Cantabria finds vaccinated people spread COVID at the same rate as the unvaccinated.", "url": "https://stream.org/spains-first-study-on-omicron-finds-vaccinated-people-spread-covid-at-same-rate-as-unvaccinated/", "site_name": "The Stream", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheStream.org/", "article:published_time": "2022-02-03T00:00:44+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-02T22:25:49+00:00", "image": "https://stream.org/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1225205799-1.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "506", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Russia-Ukraine War", "Religious Liberty", "Abortion", "Biden Scandal", "Banking Crisis", "Revival", "China", "Transgender"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1279005/v1", "https://www.eitb.eus/es/radio/radio-euskadi/programas/la-mecanica-del-caracol/detalle/8607311/omicron-se-transmite-con-mas-rapidez-que-delta-antes-de-aparicion-de-primeros-sintomas/", "https://spanishnewstoday.com/communities_across_spain_scrap_the_covid_passport_1723412-a.html", "https://stream.org/donate/", "https://www.thelocal.es/20220127/spains-catalonia-drops-covid-health-pass-requirement-for-daily-affairs/", "https://www.thelocal.es/20220127/spains-catalonia-drops-covid-health-pass-requirement-for-daily-affairs/"], "authors": ["Jon Miltimore"], "publish_date": "2022-02-03T00:00:44+00:00"}
