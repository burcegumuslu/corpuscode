Slater is a staunch critic of the experimental COVID vaccine.\n\n\u201cMaybe Stockholm Syndrome can now change its name to Melbourne/Australia Syndrome,\u201d wrote an irritated Slater.\n\nDuring the discussion, Slater criticized big pharma, saying that many individuals he knew had died after receiving the experimental vaccine.\n\n\u201cA number of people I know died. I know a doctor who stopped administering in Australia because two or three of his patients died on the Sunshine Coast.\u201d\n\nSlater revealed that his mother suffered transverse myelitis, a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord, after receiving the Pfizer shot. He also said that his mother\u2019s friend is now slowly dying from the adverse reaction to the vaccine.\n\n\u201cMy mom was personally affected. She lost feeling in her jaw and tongue and in her hands and feet. She has what seems to be some type of transverse myelitis.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend\u2019s mother from Barbados is in the hospital right now in Florida and she\u2019s dying slowly from the effects of the Pfizer vaccine. She\u2019s on a quick dark, downward spiral and they don\u2019t know how to fix it.\u201d\n\nSlater expressed concern that the once-great western countries are headed down a dangerous authoritarian path.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s baffling to me that anyone would be forced to have a vaccine to keep their career, their job, their schooling, their place in society, their ability to go buy food in the store, all these things, it\u2019s like a dystopian society to me. And I don\u2019t think people realize that because it comes on in small waves and get you conditioned to being okay with this and then this and then this and then this rule.\u201d\n\nSlater is opposed to making the shot mandatory, especially for those who choose not to have it.\n\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s wild, but if you want the vaccine go get it. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019d rather you not because if something did happen, you can\u2019t really reverse it, but force it onto me or my loved ones and don\u2019t make me out to be a bad person because of it. \u2018Cause if it works then you\u2019re fine and you shouldn\u2019t worry about me.\u201d", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Truth11.com", "type": "article", "title": "Kelly Slater Discussing The Deadly Covid Vaccine", "description": "The Gateway Pundit \u00a0/ \u00a0Jim Hoft\n\n\n\n\nKelly Slater, the legendary surfer from Cocoa Beach, Florida, has revealed that his mother suffered an adverse reaction to the Pfizer shot.\n\nSlater along with former World No. 4 Australian tennis player Pat Cash joined in the Hoody\u2019s Athletes with Voices series, where they", "url": "https://www.truth11.com/kelly-slater-a-staunch-critic-of-the-experimental-covid-vaccine/", "image": "https://cdn.getmidnight.com/6908ab1f9a9ecdaba4ee2509cb3451aa/2023/02/kelly-slater-1.jpg", "article:published_time": "2023-02-17T21:04:10.000Z", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-17T21:04:10.000Z", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ghost", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "990"}, "tags": ["VIDEOS", "SOLUTIONS", "DOCUMENTS", "IMAGES+MEMES", "FOCUS"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Surf Legend Kelly Slater discussing his mother's and friends \ud835\ude50\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a Vaccine \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68....\ud83d\udd25 <a href=\"https://t.co/ZNQ7ICrLSN?ref=truth11.com\">pic.twitter.com/ZNQ7ICrLSN</a></p>\u2014 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude47\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40 (@Risemelbourne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Risemelbourne/status/1624910105052598273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=truth11.com\">February 12, 2023</a></blockquote>\n \n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.co/ZNQ7ICrLSN?ref=truth11.com", "https://twitter.com/Risemelbourne/status/1624910105052598273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref=truth11.com", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/02/american-surfer-legend-kelly-slater-reveals-mother-suffered-adverse-reaction-pfizer-shot-video/?ref=truth11.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-02-17T21:04:10.000Z"}
