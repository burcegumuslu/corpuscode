Remember the case, Brunsun v Adam\u2019s where it involves removing the President and all of Congress? A response was due on November 23. There\u2019s been an update. Waiver:\n\n The government nearby waives its right to file a response to the petition in this case, unless requested to do so by the court. Brunson updated his Facebook saying:\n\n \u201cSolicitor general of the United States Department of Justice, replaced the US attorneys for the defendants on my lawsuit, and as of today, waived their right to respond to my lawsuit! The Supreme Court of the United States can move forward on my case!\u201d My thoughts: \n\n This case is not about challenging the election results or about fraud, but about elected officials failing to look into or block attempts of a 10 day legally required review. But let me give you a bit of background so you are aware of the developments in this rather unusual case. SOURCE \n\n Currently, there are two lawsuits identical to each other.\n\n The first One, filed by Loy Brunson is still held up in the Utah Federal Court.\n\n The second one, filed by Raland J. Brunson has made it to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS),\n\n Docket #22-380, where 9 Justices in conference will vote (only 4 needed) to move to a hearing. \n\n Both lawsuits include defendants Pres. Biden, Harris, former V.P. Pence and 385 members of congress for breaking their oath of office by voting AGAINST the proposition (that came from members of congress) to investigate the claims that there were enemies of the constitution who successfully rigged the election. BOTH LAWSUITS ARE ABOUT THE DEFENDANTS BREAKING THEIR OATH OF OFFICE \n\n \u201cI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u2026\u201d \n\n How can you support, and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign, and domestic? Answer: You investigate. If there are claims that there is a threat, even if you don\u2019t believe there is a threat, you investigate. How else can you determine if there is a threat unless you investigate? Were there claims of a threat to the Constitution? Yes. Where did these serious claims from? 100 members of Congress. What was the threat? That there were enemies of the Constitution who successfully rigged the 2020 election. Is this lawsuit about a rigged election? No, it\u2019s about the members of Congress who voted AGAINST the investigation thereby thwarting the investigation. Was this a clear violation of their oath? YES. THE RELIEF THAT LOY AND RALAND ARE SEEKING \n\n That defendants be permanently removed from office, and not allowed to hold a public office again. Loy, Raland, Deron and Gaynor Brunson (the brothers) witnessed the 2020 election along with claims from members of congress that the election was rigged. What got their attention was when the proposition to investigate those claims was presented to Congress and put to a vote. What came as a shock to the four brothers is when they discovered that 387 members of Congress along with VP Mike Pence actually voted against the proposed investigation, thus thwarting the investigation. Whether the election was rigged or not was no longer their main concern. What now became the concern was when those members of Congress violated their sworn oath by voting to thwart the investigation. The brothers wanted to do something about this. Their brother Deron had quite a lot of experience in the legal field, which started out when he began suing banks in an attempt to show the corruption in that part of the financial world, so he had enough knowledge to file a lawsuit against the now current 385 members of Congress along with VP Mike Pence, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris. He already had experience with the SCOTUS by bringing two petitions to them, both of which were denied, but this experience gave him enough success along the way to give him the confidence that maybe, just maybe, he might be able to do something about this thwarted investigation. Their brother Gaynor was heavily occupied with his audio/video television business (Rock Canyon Studios) so Deron got together with his other two brothers to plan out the strategy. They decided to have their oldest brother Loy to be the name on the lawsuit, which is called a \u201cComplaint\u201d and because he would be on the Complaint, the Court would refer to him as the Plaintiff. The 388 people being sued will now be called Defendants. Loy filed the complaint, which eventually got stuck in the Federal Court, so they got together and decided to have their brother Raland file the identical lawsuit with his name on it, in the Utah 2nd District Court. While Loy\u2019s lawsuit continued to be held hostage in the Federal Court, Raland\u2019s lawsuit eventually made it to the SCOTUS. Here are the events of both lawsuits: \n\n The Complaint\n\n (The brothers take a copy of Loy\u2019s 4th Amended Complaint, puts Raland\u2019s name in the place of Loy. Raland files the complaint in the Utah 2nd District Court.) \n\n 3 Defendants Served\n\n (The brothers acquire from the Court the Summons for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and Raland uses the Post Office as process servers. Defendants have until August 23rd to answer the complaint.) \n\n Lawsuit moved from State Court to Federal Court\n\n (The U.S. Attorneys catch wind of the lawsuit, step in acting in behalf of the United States (not the defendants) and moves the case to the Federal Court.) \n\n Motion to Dismiss\n\n (The U.S. Attorneys, acting in behalf of the United States (not the defendants) file a motion to dismiss Raland\u2019s lawsuit.) \n\n Opposition to Motion to Dismiss\n\n (After a battle regarding what court has proper jurisdiction, and after another change in who will judge it, the brothers prepare a motion opposing the Attorneys\u2019 attempt to dismiss Raland\u2019s lawsuit.) \n\n Dismiss Granted\n\n (Judge Hill Parrish dismisses Raland\u2019s lawsuit, claiming that the defendants have Sovereign Immunity protecting them from aiding the enemies of the Constitution because it was done while acting in the capacity of their office.) \n\n Raland Files an Appeal to the 10th Circuit\n\n (The brothers decide to appeal Raland\u2019s dismissal.) \n\n The Supreme Court of the United States\n\n (The brothers realize that they no longer have to wait for a decision from the 10th Circuit of Appeals. The Rule 11 enables them to bypass the 10th Circuit and go straight to the SCOTUS. Their brother Deron spent the past week crafting a perfectly well written petition for writ of certiorari. On this day Deron had his two brothers Loy and Raland fine tune it in preparation for the SCOTUS and the proper format for the printers.) \n\n Petition for Writ of Certiorari Received\n\n (The SCOTUS received the petition along with the copies for the Justices.) \n\n A phone call from SCOTUS\n\n (The Clerk of the SCOTUS calls Raland requesting for a revision of the Petition that would include more information on the lawsuit and wondering how soon they could get it.) \n\n 2nd phone call from SCOTUS\n\n (The Clerk of the SCOTUS calls Raland again. She asks \u201chow are you doing on your revision of the Writ with the additional information that we need?\u201d Raland said \u201cWe\u2019re working on it as we speak!\u201d She said \u201chow soon can we get it?\u201d Raland said \u201cRight away!\u201d) \n\n Petition docketed!\n\n (The clerk of the Court tells Raland that they have everything they need. The U.S. Attorneys have until Nov 23, 2022 to respond showing why the Supreme Court of the United States should not move on this case.) November 23, 2022\n\n The Solicitor General of the United States Department of Justice replaces the U.S. Attorneys\n\n (Good news! Elizabeth B. Prelogar, the Solicitor General of United States, the official attorney on record for the defendants, and in behalf of the 388 defendants, waived their right to respond to this lawsuit, thus allowing the SCOTUS to move forward!) The original suit filed by older brother that Raland used for his suit. \n\n The Complaint\n\n (Loy files the complaint in the Utah Federal Court) \n\n 1st Amended Complaint\n\n (The brothers make changes, and Loy files the 1st Amended complaint in the Utah Federal Court) \n\n 1st Amended Complaint Served\n\n (The Clerk of the Court had the U.S. Marshalls serve the 1st Amended Complaint on 85 defendants, including Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters before being stopped by the Court, claiming it was a \u201cclerical error by the Deputy Clerk\u201d.) Judge Romero asks Loy to Amend the Complaint, along with instructions on how to make it better. \n\n 2nd Amended Complaint\n\n (Loy Brunson (following Judge Romero\u2019s instructions) files his 2nd Amended Complaint in Utah Federal Court.) \n\n 3rd Amended Complaint\n\n (The brothers make changes, and Loy submits the 3rd Amended complaint for it to be filed in the Utah Federal Court) JUDGE ROMERO (WHO KINDLY GAVE LOY INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE THE COMPLAINT BETTER) IS NOW REPLACED WITH A DIFFERENT JUDGE, AND WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION, THE NEW JUDGE HOLDS OFF ON FILING THE 3RD AMENDED COMPLAINT. THE BROTHERS DECIDE TO GO TO THE HIGHER COURT ABOUT IT. \n\n Writ of Mandamus to the Court of Appeals (10th Circuit)\n\n (Loy files a pleading to have the 10th Circuit compel the Federal Court to file Loy\u2019s 3rd Amended Complaint) THE TENTH CIRCUIT DENIES THE PLEADING\n\n (explaining that the Federal Court will eventually get to it when they can.) \n\n 1st Motion to Reconsider\n\n (Loy files a motion reminding them that the Federal Court accepted his filing fee, but won\u2019t file his 3rd Amended Complaint, asking the 10th Circuit to reconsider, quoting the rule that the Federal Court must administer \u201cwithout denial or unecessary delay\u201d) THE TENTH CIRCUIT ONCE AGAIN DENIES THE PLEADING\n\n (explaining once again that the Federal Court will eventually get to it when they can.) THE BROTHERS DECIDE TO SUE THE FEDERAL COURT AS WELL AS THE 10TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, ASKING THEM TO EITHER RETURN LOY\u2019S FILING FEE, OR FILE HIS 3RD AMENDED COMPLAINT. \n\n Lawsuit against the two Federal Courts Filed. (Loy v. Utah Federal Court & the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)\n\n (Loy goes to the Utah 4th District Court and files the lawsuit against the two Federal Courts. Even though the U.S. Attorneys explain to the Court that it cannot judge a case against the Federal Courts, Judge Low accepts the filing fee and judges the case anyway.) BY MOTIONS FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE 4th DISTRICT COURT DISMISSES LOY\u2019S COMPLAINT THAT WAS AGAINST THE TWO FEDERAL COURTS\n\n (explaining that the Federal Court will get to filing his 3rd Amended Complaint when they can.) THE BROTHERS MAKE FOUR MORE ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE DISTRICT COURT COMPEL THE TWO FEDERAL COURTS TO FILE LOY\u2019S 3RD AMENDED COMPLAINT. ALL ATTEMPTS DENIED WITH THE SAME EXPLANATION \n\n 3rd Amended Complaint Filed!\n\n (After 7 months, and for reasons not explained, the Federal court files Loy\u2019s 3rd Amended Complaint and back dates it to April 20, 2021) \n\n 4th Amended Complaint\n\n (The brothers make changes and Loy submits the 4th Amended complaint to be filed in the Utah Federal Court.\n\n The Court waits until March 28, 2022 to finally file it.) \n\n The Summons\n\n (The court issues the summons for the 388 defendants. The Clerk of the Court contacts Loy and let\u2019s him know that he can pick up the box filled with the Summons for the 388 defendants that have been stamped with the seal of the court. The brothers can now serve all 388 defendants with the summons and complaint.) \n\n Serving the lawsuit on all 388 defendants\n\n (The brothers along with their friend Duane Bingham stuffs envelopes with a copy of the complaint along with the summons for the 388 defendants. The brothers are using the U.S. Postal Service to act as process servers to all defendants. The 388 packets were delivered to the post office staff who were waiting to process the service.)\n\n \n\n The defendants have 60 days to answer the complaint. (The brothers along with their friend Duane Bingham stuffs envelopes with a copy of the complaint along with the summons for the 388 defendants. The brothers are using the U.S. Postal Service to act as process servers to all defendants. The 388 packets were delivered to the post office staff who were waiting to process the service.)The defendants have 60 days to answer the complaint. \n\n U.S. Attorneys Motion To Dismiss\n\n (The U.S. Attorneys file a motion to dismiss Loy\u2019s lawsuit on the grounds that defendants are protected under Title 28 which gives defendents Soveriegn Immunity from any lawsuits relating to actions of treason while serving in the capacity of their office. The U.S. Attorneys also file a notice of appearance in behalf of all the defendants, making them the official attorneys on record, instead of representing them \u201cspecially\u201d. ) July 6, 2022\n\n Opposition to Motion To Dismiss\n\n (The brothers prepare the opposition to the Attorneys\u2019 attempt to dismiss the the lawsuit, and Loy files it in the Utah Federal Court. the brothers are still waiting to this day for the court to make a decision.)\n\n This case uncovers a serious national security breach that is unique and is of first impression, and due to the serious nature of this case it INVOLVES THE POSSIBLE REMOVAL OF A SITTING PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ALONG WITH MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, while deeming them unfit from ever holding office under Federal, State, County or local Governments found within the United States of America, and at the same time the trial court also has the authority, to be validated by this Court, to authorize the swearing in of the legal and rightful heirs for President and Vice President of the United States.\n\n \u2026\n\n JOSEPH ROBINETTE BIDEN JR in his capacity of President of the United States; MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE in his capacity as former Vice President of the United States, and KAMALA HARRIS in her capacity as Vice President of the United States and JOHN and JANE DOES 1-100.\n\n \u2026 This action is against 388 federal officers in their official capacities which include President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, Vice President Kamala Harris, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Michael Richard Pence (\u201cRespondents\u201d). All the Respondents have taken the required Oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and as such they are liable for consequences when they violate the Oath of Office.\n\n \u2026\n\n On January 6, 2021, the 117th Congress held a proceeding and debate in Washington DC (\u201cProceeding\u201d). Proceeding was for the purpose of counting votes under the 2020 Presidential election for the President and Vice President of the United States under Amendment XII. During this Proceeding over 100 members of U.S. Congress claimed factual evidence that the said election was rigged. The refusal of the Respondents to investigate this congressional claim (the enemy) IS AN ACT OF TREASON AND FRAUD by Respondents. A successfully rigged election has the same end result as AN ACT OF WAR; to place into power whom the victor wants, which in this case is Biden, who, if not stopped immediately, will continue to destroy the fundamental freedoms of Brunson and all U.S. Citizens and courts of law.\n\n \u2026\u201d This document\n\n Source Docket\n\n Ralands Facebook Post\n\n Ralands background story of the lawsuit\n\n Good breakdown VIDEO Update on the Raland Brunson (Interview begins at 10:30 in)\n\n Supreme Court case: Loy Brunson explains why he\u2019s so optimistic and gives more insight about how this case was filed and successfully docketed.\n\n (Because it was recognized as a concern of National Emergency)\n\n Also why it was already expected that the Gov would waive the right to respond, and why that\u2019s perfectly fine.

The disease was also reported on Friday by Germany, Australia, France and Belgium, while two cases were confirmed in Canada. Monkeypox causes a contagious rash similar to chickenpox in humans, and is spread through close contact. Symptoms, which usually appear within the first five days of infection, include muscle aches, chills, fever, swollen glands, exhaustion \u2013 and of course, pustules. The mortality rate for monkeypox ranges from 1% to 15%, and is endemic in three countries; the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. The first reported case detected in the UK had traveled to Nigeria, after which they returned with a rash, according to the WHO.

LINK Planned Parenthood has announced it will close five abortion centers in Indiana, Idaho and Alaska. The news follows a new report the other day indicating the billion-dollar abortion chain Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. We are told that on the day of Pentecost, when the wind of the Spirit came, they are of one accord. Paul has begun to show them of the error in their church. First of all, he explains that they must be together, that division is not what God would have. If they are truly in Christ Jesus, then they would be one in Him. Paul is explaining to them that there is one message from God that saved them, and they must stick with that message. This is what happens when you conflate sexual orientation with sexual identity. Last month the government funded AIDS Council of NSW (ACON) appointed a man, who identifies as a lesbian, to promote the Lesbian Day of Visibility. Rosie Piper, a transwoman and a comedian says he is a \u201cblokey lesbian\u201d and a \u201cstraight man\u201d who has been living in the wrong body. Gay women, actual lesbians, were furious. University of Sydney emeritus Professor Bronwyn Winter questioned how a transgender woman could be chosen to raise awareness of lesbian issues and said it was part of a wider push by some in the trans community to replace \u201csame sex attraction\u201d with \u201csame gender identity attraction\u201d. She said ACON\u2019s campaign \u201d was \u201cinsulting to lesbians\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of lesbians who will never accept male-bodied people can be lesbians,\u201d she said. Prof Winter is a lesbian and one of the founders of the campaign group called Respect My Sex, which is calling on Australian voters to ask their candidates at the upcoming election questions about sex based rights. \u201cLesbians who want to socialize with lesbians are now being driven underground,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is no longer legal for us to organize a social event without males in the room.\u201d She cited a tribunal case in Tasmania where LGB Alliance member Jessica Hoyle sought an exemption to be able to hold lesbian events without \u201cpeople with penises\u201d. The exemption was rejected by the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination commissioner Sarah Bolt. The LGBT community, the media and politicians have long conflated sexual orientation with sexual identity. Sexual orientation relies on biological reality. Same sex attraction is based on people being the same sex. Transgenderism denies biological reality and relies on the appropriation of sex. In almost every scenario, it is girls and women who suffer the disadvantage of the aggressive gender agenda.

Compound the hellacious weather backdrop with grids decommissioning fossil fuel power plants to fight climate change and their inability to bring on new green power generation, such as solar, wind, and batteries, in time, is a perfect storm waiting to happen that will produce electricity deficits that may force power companies into rolling blackouts for stability purposes.
