It\u2019s as if they\u2019ve forgotten the decades of water fluoridation. The water supply has been meticulously, systematically poisoned with toxic fluoride, which is a neurotoxic chemical,\u201d Adams pointed out during a recent episode of \u201cBrighteon Conversations\u201d featuring Ardis as guest.\n\n\u201cUsually it comes in the form of a powder originally, and then it\u2019s put into solution. Well, in every Municipal Water Center, there is a machine that drips the proper dose of poison into the water supply, folks. So how can anybody say they\u2019re not poisoning us in the water?\u201d\n\nThe funny thing, according to Ardis, is that the water angle is not even the point he is trying to drive home.\n\n\u201cI have said for the from the beginning for the last two years, whatever the bioweapon is \u2013 it\u2019s not very good. Because less than one percent of the entire world has died from it. Whatever they\u2019ve been investing billions of dollars into, 99.997 percent of everyone worldwide has survived. That means God\u2019s creation has been way greater than whatever man has weaponized,\u201d Ardis said.\n\n\u201cSo even with the water source, if that is the source, I never thought it was dangerous. I never thought it was horrific and demonizing and everyone is gonna look at the water. But I want to make sure the water thing is handled here.\u201d\n\nFor those asking for proof about the water angle of the story, Ardis said: \u201cLook at what the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has been doing; what they\u2019ve been actually looking the whole time is the bioweapon called SARS-CoV-2. They have 400 water testing sites in different cities around the country. And they\u2019re sticking cotton swabs, doing PCR testing on your water looking for SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nAnd with recent reports bringing up the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has a snake venom component, the idea that Americans are getting poisoned with potable water is suddenly no longer not far-fetched.

Scientists from the University of Arizona have discovered an enzyme similar to one found in rattlesnake venom that could be driving the COVID-19 deaths.\n\n\u201cWe found evidence that there was an enzyme, a snake-like enzyme, in the blood of people who were in extraordinarily high levels,\u201d said the senior author of the study, Dr. Floyd Chilton.\n\nScientists have worked on the study for over a year, and the snake-like enzyme has been found in healthy people at low case levels to prevent bacterial infections. In severe cases of COVID-19, however, it\u2019s doing the opposite.\n\nChiton also said that the study could help researchers come up with specific therapeutics that will not care which variant is coming.\n\nAccording to the researchers, current clinical trials on snake bites are helping in those efforts. They hope to repurpose the treatments, which could one day result in a viable option to prevent death in severe COVID patients.\n\nChilton said that this will allow scientists to take a precision medicine approach to the disease. \u201cWe can go into clinical trials and choose the people who are at risk of this mechanism and then specifically treat those people,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers are also set to develop an international multi-center clinical trial, working with global organizations to see how they can make this approach possible.
