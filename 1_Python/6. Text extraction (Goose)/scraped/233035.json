These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information; therefore, fact-checking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources.\n\u2022 Overall, we rate the Vaccine Papers a quackery-level pseudoscience website based on the promotion of debunked anti-vaccine propaganda.\n\nFirst indexed by Google in 2015, Vaccine Papers is a website that promotes vaccine misinformation and Pseudoscience. The website also lacks transparency as they state on their about page they choose to remain anonymous. The about page further reports, \u201cpowerful scientific evidence has emerged indicating that vaccines cause brain injury such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, attention-deficit disorder, and other mental illnesses. This scientific evidence has been largely ignored by the media and medical institutions supposedly guided by science.\u201d\n\nVaccine Papers lack transparency as they do not disclose ownership. At this time, it is unclear how they generate revenue.\n\nVaccine Papers promote pseudoscience and anti-vaccine propaganda by publishing debunked claims such as vaccines causing autism: Autistic Brains Have High Aluminum Levels. Vaccines causing Autism have been refuted by the CDC and all credible scientific research. The wording of headlines and articles uses minimally loaded language.\n\nRegarding sourcing, links are provided in the Library section of the site to scientific studies; however, these studies do not support the claims made or have been retracted. http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/Measles-Mumps-and-Rubella-Vaccination-and-Autism-NEJM-letters.pdf.\n\nAlthough this site consistently promotes anti-vaccine pseudoscience, they have a section titled Bad Science that debunks claims such as Chemtrails Debunked Part 1: Contrails. Vaccines Papers generally promote quackery-level pseudoscience that is sometimes false or unproven.\n\u2022 None found. See above examples of false and misleading claims.\n\nOverall, we rate the Vaccine Papers a quackery-level pseudoscience website based on the promotion of debunked anti-vaccine propaganda. (J.
