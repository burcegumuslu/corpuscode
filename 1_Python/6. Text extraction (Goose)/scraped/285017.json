The smaller countries that have independent ideas, Serbia, Croatia, Austria, Hungary, are vassals to their allies.\n\nVucic\u2019s main message: \u201cThe fighting to date will feel like \u201calmost nothing, compared to what\u2019s coming..\u201d And then watch Gonzalo\u2019s tweet. The US has sent Samantha Power to Budapest to trip Orban. A literal power game.\n\u2022 Serbian President Sees \u201cMajor Escalation\u201d In Ukraine Over Next 6 Months (RT)\n\nThe moment is approaching when Serbia will have no choice but to give in to Western demands to sanction its ally Russia, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has said. In an interview with Prva broadcaster on Friday, Vucic said he expects \u201ca major escalation\u201d in the conflict in Ukraine over the next six months. The fighting to date will feel like \u201calmost nothing, compared to what\u2019s coming,\u201d he warned. This situation \u201cwill affect our country as the pressure on Belgrade, in terms of its relations with Russia, will become two or three times tougher \u2013 despite already being very strong now,\u201d the president said. Sanctioning Moscow over its military operation in Ukraine and recognizing the independence of the breakaway province of Kosovo have been singled out by Brussels as key conditions for Belgrade\u2019s bid to join the EU. Vucic, who has been rejecting both demands for months, now says the moment may eventually come when Belgrade would have to join the EU\u2019s curbs on Moscow. \u201cLet us push like this as long as we can, I will know when the moment is right, and I will not hide anything from people. That moment [when Serbia sanctions Russia] has been approaching for a long time, I am afraid that it\u2019s not even months away,\u201d he said. The Serbian president revealed that he used to believe that the West, which is backing the Kiev government with weapons, funds and intelligence, was getting the upper hand in Ukraine. However, \u201cat this moment, it\u2019s no longer entirely clear who is winning in Ukraine,\u201d he added. Moscow\u2019s chances of succeeding have been boosted by the fact that there is now \u201cunity\u201d among the Russian people regarding the conflict, especially after the announcement by Berlin and some other countries last month that German-made Leopard tanks would be supplied to Kiev, he said. According to Vucic, it\u2019ll be \u201cdifficult\u201d for Serbia no matter who prevails in Ukraine. \u201cThe West doesn\u2019t want a country allied with Russia in the middle of Europe. On the other hand, Russia doesn\u2019t want to lose everything it has in the Balkans,\u201d he said. That\u2019s why Belgrade remains among the few international players who speak about the need for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but \u201cno one is allowed to mention peace anymore,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201c..the notion that Serbia should \u201cbreak completely with Russia,\u201d and \u201cthrow out Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Tolstoy\u201d is equally absurd. \u201cThat can\u2019t be Serbia, we have to take care of the soul of our people..\u201d\n\nSerbia will not jump on the Russia-bashing bandwagon and cancel the country\u2019s culture, President Aleksandar Vucic has told media. He explained that preserving the Russian classics in the public domain is as important as guarding national financial interests. In an interview with Serbia\u2019s Prva news channel broadcast on Friday, Vucic acknowledged that his country largely depends on the West in terms of investment. For this reason, the president noted, those who call on Belgrade to cut these ties \u201cdon\u2019t know how the country works.\u201d Vucic went on to argue that the notion that Serbia should \u201cbreak completely with Russia,\u201d and \u201cthrow out [novelist] Dostoyevsky, [composer] Tchaikovsky and [writer] Tolstoy\u201d is equally absurd. \u201cThat can\u2019t be Serbia, we have to take care of the soul of our people,\u201d the president clarified. Last month, during a press conference in the Russian embassy in Belgrade, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s special envoy on international cultural cooperation, Mikhail Shvydkoy, announced that Belgrade and Moscow were discussing holding a year of cultural exchange in 2024. Several renowned Russian musicians will visit Serbia already this year. On top of that, a meeting of Russian and Serbian academia is also in the pipeline, Shvydkoy revealed.Following the start of Russia\u2019s military operation against Ukraine in late February 2022, a number of European cultural venues have canceled the staging of artworks which have Russian origins and have also barred some Russian performers who have refused to denounce Moscow\u2019s actions. Certain politicians in the EU have also spoken in favor of such bans. As recently as early January, Lithuanian culture minister Simonas Kairys spoke in favor of a \u201cmental quarantine\u201d on Russian culture, claiming the latter is being used by Moscow as a \u201cweapon.\u201d Earlier, the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra in Wales erased music by Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky from a concert program, while Britain\u2019s Royal Opera House called off a tour by the Bolshoi Ballet. Netflix, in turn, put on hold the production of \u2018Anna K,\u2019 an adaptation of Leo Tolstoy\u2019s novel \u2018Anna Karenina\u2019. Commenting on these tendencies, Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn parallels between Western efforts to cancel Russian culture to the Nazi practice of book burning.\n\n\u201c..an inconvenient narrative arises, the government and lemmings in the media slander it as false and dangerous, and, months later, the dispute in question turns out to be true..\u201d\n\nWednesday morning, Seymour Hersh published \u201cHow America Took Out The Nord Stream Pipeline.\u201d The Nord Stream 1 and 2 Pipelines exploded in September 2022. The Nord Stream 1 has delivered natural gas from Russia to Europe for over a decade, and Russia was developing the Nord Stream 2 at the time. Outlets like The New York Times called the explosions \u201ca mystery.\u201d The sabotage presented a major energy crisis for the United States\u2019 European allies. Europe imports nearly 40% of its gas from Russia, and the Nord Stream 1 was responsible for delivering approximately one third of that supply. Now, Hersh reports that \u201cthe United States executed a covert sea operation\u201d with Navy divers to sabotage Russia\u2019s pipelines with explosives. For a less obsequious press corps, this should have been an easy story to crack. In the weeks leading up to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, President Biden announced his intention to act against the pipelines in the event of war. \u201cIf Russia invades\u2026 there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe will bring an end to it.\u201d \u201cHow will you do that exactly?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cI promise you we will be able to do it,\u201d President Biden said with a slight smile. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland was equally as explicit. \u201cI want to be very clear to you today,\u201d she told reporters in January 2022. \u201cIf Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.\u201d In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d in the West for \u201cterror attacks\u201d on the pipelines. \u201cThose who profit from it have done it,\u201d Putin told the press. President Biden chastised Putin\u2019s accusation for \u201cpumping out disinformation and lies.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t listen to what Putin\u2019s saying,\u201d Biden added. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying we know is not true.\u201d White House National Security spokeswoman Adrienne Watson backed up Biden\u2019s claim, referring to Putin\u2019s accusation as \u201cRussia\u2019s disinformation.\u201d Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador also implied that the United States had been involved in the sabotage. Richard Mills, U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., responded by calling the claims \u201cconspiracy theories and disinformation.\u201d Despite the Commander and Chief\u2019s explicit announcement that he would take action against the Nord Stream pipeline, a credulous press corps has dutifully parotted government talking points that accusations of western involvement in the sabotage are \u201cbaseless\u201d \u201cmisinformation,\u201d \u201cdisinformation,\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d This all follows a similar pattern to the informational warfare of the Covid era: an inconvenient narrative arises, the government and lemmings in the media slander it as false and dangerous, and, months later, the dispute in question turns out to be true (or at least highly plausible). Arguments over natural immunity, vaccine efficacy, masks, the lab leak hypothesis, school shutdowns, lockdowns, and the scientific basis of social distancing are just a few examples that followed this cycle of reporting. This was the same pattern as The New York Post\u2019s coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop. Now, at hearings to investigate corruption that implicated Big Tech, intelligence officials, and the federal government, Raskin and his cohorts return to their familiar censorship ploys. For censors, augmentation of power, not truth, remains the chief objective. To achieve this goal, they conflate dissent with domestic terrorism.\n\nNot every point is equally strong.\n\u2022 Who Benefitted From This Chaos? (Tucker)\n\nLet\u2019s just go through the list of beneficiaries I first compiled two years ago. 1. The tech companies that became so enraptured with the digital world\u2014and we can include online retailers in this\u2014that they forgot all the people who cannot and do not want to live entirely outside the physical world. To be sure, many of these high flying companies are now coming back to earth thanks to higher interest rates. Even Zoom may be falling on hard times. To which I say: Schadenfreude. 2. The pharmaceutical companies with hundreds of billions of investment in labs and distribution circles that wanted to ply their wares in the midst of emergencies, in addition to the PCR testing industry, not to mention mask and ventilator makers and so many other grifting companies in this space. They not only gain from tremendous subsidies and indemnification from damages; they even got governments to conscript their customer base. 3. Public health intellectuals, who for at least a decade and a half had fallen for the romance of computer modeling, were itching to try out a new method for disease mitigation. They must have gotten quite a kick out of watching the experiment tried out in real time. Speaking of: we haven\u2019t heard from these people in a very long time. They seem conveniently very quiet. Notice how the prophets of doom who were all over the news three years ago, with their magic ability to see the future with precision, have completely vanished? 4. The mega-billionaire Bill Gates found himself vexed by computer viruses that were wrecking his Windows operating system and thereby developed a passion for blocking viruses in general, while failing to understand the difference between biology and computer hardware. He seems to have done very well for himself, not only with his investments but now with his new book telling us how he will single-handedly change the path of the global climate. 5. Government officials certainly had a field day trying out new uses of power. My goodness, they even got their mitts on social media, scripting who gets to speak and who cannot. The national security state hasn\u2019t had this much fun since the Cold War. It was, in short, the most successful ramp up of government power the world over in modern times or maybe ever. Disease panic proved more advantageous to them than ever war and economic depression. 6. Media companies, who live on clicks and know with certainty that public panic is the best way to guarantee consumer attention, did especially well, given that millions were locked at home with nothing else to do. Talk about a captive audience! 7. The Chinese government, which was supremely annoyed at the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies, successfully trolled the West into believing that China nixed the virus through totalitarian controls. It can now brag to have scripted the pandemic response for the whole world, and is now goading the World Health Organization into doing ever more of it. 8. Rabid opponents of the Trump administration, who had failed to wreck it through accusations of Russian collusion and then impeachment over a phone call to Ukraine, finally turned to creating tremendous social, economic, and political chaos by massively overblowing the severity of a widespread viral pathogen, which itself became a metaphor for the political infection they believed afflicted the country. This was the final undoing of the administration, much to the celebration of his political opponents. 9. School teachers\u2019 unions that have been wanting to strike for years in order to extract pay and benefits from the taxpayer, worried that doing so would turn their public against them; for them, lockdowns were the perfect excuse to find another way. They abandoned their jobs and got paid anyway. Then they tried to make the racket last as long as possible. 10. A ruling-class population that has lost touch with people who cannot live on their computers, had become increasingly detached from the flow of life as it exists in the physical world, utterly failed to empathize with the suffering of others under lockdown. But they rather warmed up to the mess they had created because it meant they could make the big bucks while never changing out of their PJs.\n\nWar OF terror vs war ON terror.\n\n\u201cA positive screamer is that Hersh \u2013 rather, his key source \u2013 had the MI6 completely vanish from the narrative..\u201d\n\u2022 The War of Terror of a Rogue Superpower: Cui Bono? (Escobar)\n\nWhen it comes to the Global South, what the Hersh report imprints is Rogue Superpower, in giant blood red letters, as state sponsor of terrorism. Everyone with a brain already knew the Empire did it. Now Seymour Hersh\u2019s bombshell report not only details how Nord Stream 1 and 2 were attacked, but also names names: from the toxic Straussian neoliberal-con trio Sullivan, Blinken and Nuland all the way to the Teleprompter Reader-in-Chief. Arguably the most incandescent nugget in Hersh\u2019s narrative is to point ultimate responsibility directly at the White House. The CIA, for its part, gets away with it. The whole report may be read as the framing of a scapegoat. A very fragile, shoddy scapegoat \u2013 what with those classified documents in the garage, the endless stares into the void, the cornucopia of incomprehensible mumbling, and of course the whole, ghastly, years-long family corruption carousel in and around Ukraine, still to be completely unveiled. Hersh\u2019s report happened to pop up immediately after the deadly earthquakes in Turkey/Syria. This is an investigative journalism earthquake in itself, straddling over fault lines and revealing countless open air fissures, nuggets of truth gasping for air amidst the rubble. But is that all there is? Does the narrative hold from start to finish? Yes and no. First of all, why now? This is a leak \u2013 essentially from one Deep State insider, Hersh\u2019s key source. This 21st century \u201cDeep Throat\u201d remix may be appalled at the toxicity of the system, but at the same time he knows that whatever he says, there will be no consequences. Cowardly Berlin \u2013 ignoring the nuts and bolts of the scheme all along \u2013 will not even squeak. After all the Green gang has been ecstatic, because the terror attack has thoroughly advanced their medieval de-industrialization agenda. In parallel, as an extra bonus, all the other European vassals receive further confirmation this is the fate that awaits them if they don\u2019t follow His Master\u2019s Voice. Hersh\u2019s narrative frames the Norwegians as the essential accessory to terror. Hardly surprising: NATO\u2019s Jens \u201cPeace is War\u201d Stoltenberg has been a CIA asset for perhaps half a century. And Oslo of course had its own motives to be part of the deal; to collect loads of extra cash selling whatever spare energy it had for desperate European customers. A little narrative problem is that Norway, unlike the U.S. Navy, still does not have any operational P-8 Poseidon. What was clear at the time is that an American P-8 was commuting back and forth \u2013 with mid-air refueling \u2013 from the U.S. to Bornholm island. A positive screamer is that Hersh \u2013 rather, his key source \u2013 had the MI6 completely vanish from the narrative. SVR, Russian intel, had focused like a laser on MI6 at the time, as well as the Poles. What still cements the narrative is that the combo behind \u201cBiden\u201d provided the planning, the intel and coordinated the logistics, while the final act \u2013 in this case a sonar buoy detonating the C4 explosives \u2013 may have been perpetrated by the Norwegian vassals. The problem is the buoy may have been dropped by an American P-8. And there\u2019s no explanation of why one of the sections of Nord Stream 2 escaped intact.\n\n\u201c..talks that should be based on the existing reality..\u201d\n\u2022 Russia Ready For Talks With Ukraine, With No Preconditions \u2013 Deputy FM (TASS)\n\nIs Russia pushing Zakharova forward? See her a lot.\n\nBaerbock swallowed her words. \u201c..if you are hypocritical again, you are making an irreparable mistake this time,\u201d Zakharova wrote..\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a [malicious] intent that dealt a blow to global security..\u201d\n\u2022 IMF To Meet Ukraine Officials In Warsaw Next Week (R.)\n\n\u201c..if there\u2019s a war to be fought, she wants to be the one with her finger on that proverbial trigger.\u201d\n\nFormer Democratic US Representative Tulsi Gabbard has continued her long-running feud with Hillary Clinton following the ex-Secretary of State\u2019s recent visit to India. She told Fox News that the trip served little purpose, and shows that former presidential candidate is a \u201cdangerous character\u201d who is \u201cenvious\u201d of Joe Biden. Clinton arrived in India on February 5, visiting salt pan workers in Gujarat where she announced a $50-million initiative intended to empower women and communities to fight against climate change. However, Gabbard \u2013 who left the Democrat Party last year \u2013 has since said that Clinton\u2019s visit to drum up support for alternative clean energy shows that she still covets diplomatic authority and is \u201cenvious\u201d of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. \u201cHer desire to be commander-in-chief that she\u2019s had for a very long time has nothing to do with ensuring the safety and security of the American people,\u201d Gabbard said on FOX News\u2019 \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime\u2019 show Thursday. \u201cIt has everything to do with the fact that if there\u2019s a war to be fought, she wants to be the one with her finger on that proverbial trigger.\u201d She added that she believes Biden to be \u201cchannelling her warmongering ways.\u201d Clinton has previously referred to Gabbard as a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d which prompted the former Hawaii Democrat to launch a defamation lawsuit. Gabbard also stated that Clinton\u2019s visit to India did nothing to address India\u2019s more pressing issues, such as tensions with its neighbor Pakistan, and that its only benefit was to increase her own public profile. \u201cThis is what makes her such a dangerous character,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cShe feels that she\u2019s not accountable to anyone because she\u2019s not suffering those consequences.\u201d While in India, Clinton said that the country was ideally positioned to implement clean energy methods, which, she claimed, would increase economic growth. She referenced solar power facilities at a salt pan farm she\u2019d visited in Surendranagar as evidence of this. Clinton also used the visit to praise self-employed Indian women who have chosen to work in roles such as street vendors, farmers and laborers.\n\n\u201cWhile some like McCaskill yell \u201cRussians!\u201d others use more modern labels, such as \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d That notably includes the FBI itself..\u201d\n\nIn my testimony, I warned that this was reminiscent of the McCarthy period where the FBI played a role in the establishment of blacklists for socialist, communists, and others. I encouraged Congress not to repeat its failures from the 1950s by turning a blind eye to such abuse. This view was amplified by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who became persona non grata for her anti-war sentiments in Congress. She was later labeled a \u201cRussian asset\u201d by Hillary Clinton, who has refused to support that scurrilous claim of a former member. For years, the Democrats pushed a Russian collusion theory that collapsed. It was later disclosed that the Clinton campaign hid and then lied about funding the infamous Steele Dossier. Nevertheless, people like Carter Page were falsely accused of being Russian agents and critics labeled as Russian apologists. Ironically, the FBI was warned that the dossier appeared to be the result of Russian disinformation and relied on a presumed Russian agent. If anything, my warning of McCarthy-like attacks and measures seemed to be taken more as a suggestion than an admonition by some. Yet soon after the end of the hearing, MSNBC contributor and former Sen. Claire McCaskill appeared on MSNBC to denounce the member witnesses (Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Ron Johnson, and former Rep. Gabbard) as \u201cPutin apologists\u201d and Putin lovers. She exclaimed, \u201cI mean, look at this, I mean, all three of those politicians are Putin apologists. I mean, Tulsi Gabbard loves Putin.\u201d (For the record, she also attacked me as not being \u201ca real lawyer.\u201d) [..] In the 1950s, it was easy for politicians to avoid discussing underlying views by just labeling their opponents as fellow travelers. We are watching the same use of personal attacks today as a way to evade the troubling disclosures in the Twitter Files. While some like McCaskill yell \u201cRussians!\u201d others use more modern labels, such as \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d That notably includes the FBI itself. When criticized for the role FBI agents played in secretly targeting citizens for censorship, the FBI called critics \u201cconspiracy theorists . . . feeding the American public misinformation.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone did a lot of research on the topic for his book.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has privately asked members of his cabinet to work out ways of rebuilding connections with the EU that had been severed after Brexit in 2020, government sources have told Bloomberg. Plans are currently being put together at 10 Downing Street to boost ties between London and Brussels in such areas as defense, migration and the economy, including trade, energy and international standards, the agency reported on Saturday. According to British ministers, diplomats and officials, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, the rapprochement is being prepared in order to compensate for the fallout of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in which London positions itself among the prime backers of the Kiev authorities. In the coming days, Sunak\u2019s government is hoping to announce a solution to the longstanding dispute with the EU over post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. London\u2019s plan is to capitalize on this development and make it the basis for further improving ties with the 27-member bloc. Bloomberg pointed out that by moving in this direction, the PM is risking causing anger among the anti-EU lawmakers from his ruling Conservative Party. Another challenge for Sunak would be overcoming the skepticism of European leaders, who got tired of top British politicians using the bloc as a \u201cpunch bag for their domestic audience\u201d since the Brexit vote in 2016, it added. One of the sources assured Bloomberg that the alleged turn towards Europe didn\u2019t mean that Brexit was a mistake but was merely a reflection of the changing geopolitical situation. According to another official, Sunak\u2019s subordinates were able to persuade the Prime Minister, who has been in office since late October, that in the current reality of \u201ca more dangerous world, rising authoritarianism and protectionism,\u201d closer cooperation with allies was absolutely essential for the UK. Achieving this would require Britain to give up on its \u201cmadman strategy\u201d of resisting the EU, in favor of a stable relationship with the bloc as critical friends, he said. By standing together, London and Brussels would be able to withstand economic turbulence and threats posed by Russia and China more effectively, the source explained.\n\nTriangular impossible object, devised in the 1950s by Lionel Penrose and his son, Nobel Prize-winning mathematician Sir Roger Penrose\n\n https://twitter.com/i/status/1624400863732047873\n\nSupport the Automatic Earth in virustime with Paypal, Bitcoin and Patreon.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Debt Rattle February 12 2023 - The Automatic Earth", "description": "Support the Automatic Earth in virustime with Paypal, Bitcoin and Patreon.", "url": "https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2023/02/debt-rattle-february-12-2023/", "site_name": "The Automatic Earth", "article:published_time": "2023-02-12T09:58:11+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-12T09:58:40+00:00", "image": "https://theautomaticearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CaveOfSwimmers6000BCE.jpg"}, "tags": ["Tulsi Gabbard", "superpower", "red scare", "Trump", "Baerbock", "cui bono", "preconditions", "Vucic", "censorship", "smear", "Zakharova", "Orban"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After the earthquake in Hatay, Turkey a 30-meter-deep rift was formed along the fault.
