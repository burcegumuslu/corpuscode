Data on vaccine disabilities and injuries comes directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), while the excess death figures are derived from official figures on deaths in the US via two different methods (methodology here ).It's important to note that people in one category (injured, for example) can move into latter categories of severity - which this analysis does not take into consideration.\"We need to remember that not only are these groupings an attempt to characterize different levels of damage from the inoculations, they are,\" reads the report. \"For instance,.\", or an extreme outcome such as death.\"In analyzing each of the above categories, Phinance used absolute excess lost worktime (see previous report ) to determine thatFor deaths, Phinace used the average yearly absolute rise in excess deaths since 2021, which was 0.05% for the 25-64 year-old demographic, which amounted toIn total, they found adue to the Covid-19 vaccines.As Dowd notes,, as things like \"The knock effects such as lost productivity due to a worker being present but working at say 50%-75% of capacity is missed plus burn out from those picking up slack.\"\"The multiplier effects are massive.\"Now imagine the impact worldwide...", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/478913-Bombshell-vax-analysis-finds-147-Billion-in-economic-damage-tens-of-millions-injured-or-disabled", "type": "website", "title": "Bombshell vax analysis finds $147 Billion in economic damage, tens of millions injured or disabled -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/674832/full/vaccine_1_0.jpg", "description": "A new report estimates that 26.6 million people were injured, 1.36 million disabled, and 300,000 excess deaths can be attributed to COVID-19 vaccine damages in 2022 alone, which cost the economy nearly $150 billion Research firm Phinance...", "site_name": "Sott.net"}, "tags": ["Comets", "SOTT Radio Network", "JFK Series", "Storms", "Plagues", "9/11", "Smoking", "Drought", "Extreme Temperatures", "Wildfires", "Animals", "Sinkholes", "Floods", "SOTT Summaries", "Volcanoes", "Comets and Catastrophe Series", "Strange Skies", "Strange Sounds", "Fireballs", "Earthquakes"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/image/s33/674832/full/vaccine_1_0.jpg", "http://www.phinancetechnologies.com/HumanityProjects/The%20VDamage%20Project%20-%20Economic%20Impact.htm", "http://www.phinancetechnologies.com", "http://www.phinancetechnologies.com/HumanityProjects/The%20VDamage%20Project%20-%20Human%20%20Cost.htm", "http://www.phinancetechnologies.com/HumanityProjects/Resources/Report%20on%20measuring%20death%20rates%20-%20V3%20-%20US.pdf", "https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/extraordinary-change-labor-data-reveals-shocking-drop-workplace-attendance-following-vax", "http://www.phinancetechnologies.com/HumanityProjects/US%20Absence%20rates%20-%20Part3.htm"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
