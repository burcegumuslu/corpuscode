While he was quick to state that he is not retiring and still plans to \u201cpursue the next phase\u201d of his career,1 someone will be stepping in to take his place as lead propagandist for Big Pharma and the global Deep State.\n\nThat someone is likely to be Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, a replacement that could end up being even worse than Fauci.\n\n\u201cThe proper replacement would be a candidate who is an advocate for data transparency and free speech. You know \u2014 truth. There is almost no chance we\u2019ll get that. I am almost certain we\u2019ll get the opposite,\u201d notes Steve Kirsch, executive director of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.2\n\nHotez is portrayed in the media as a heroic figure out to save the world by developing \u201clife-saving\u201d vaccines \u2014 one who\u2019s being targeted by a \u201cpowerful anti-vax lobby.\u201d3 He was even nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. But the real Peter Hotez is a person who pushes for mass vaccination using experimental drugs and vilifies anyone who advocates for vaccine choice and informed consent.\n\nJournalist Dan Cohen investigated Hotez, doing a \u201cdeep dive into his background\u201d that was published by Redacted. He described his findings as shocking:4\n\nHis career has been largely devoted to developing drugs to test on \u201cunderdeveloped and hyper-exploited countries in Latin America, South Asia and Africa,\u201d while much of Hotez\u2019s success can be traced back to Fauci, Bill Gates and Bill Clinton, Cohen explains.\n\nHotez was instrumental in propelling \u201cneglected tropical diseases\u201d into a key initiative that needed to be addressed with more vaccines. In 2000, with $18 million from the Gates Foundation, Hotez founded a department at George Washington University and is now president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, where he started the Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative to continue the development of his hookworm shot.6\n\nIn 2006, at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), the Sabin Institute launched a global network for neglected tropical diseases. \u201cClinton decided that these neglected tropical diseases needed attention. So, actually, CGI has been incredibly important in the development of this organization to give it the attention it needs and as a result of CGI, we\u2019ve been able to now attract some large-scale donors,\u201d Hotez said at the time.7\n\nFrom 2006 to 2021, the USAID spent $1.1 billion on neglected tropical diseases, and Big Pharma gave $28.6 billion worth of drugs to administer. But for Hotez, \u201cthese diseases and conditions are mere pretext to develop and deliver drugs.\u201d8 As Dr. Richard Urso explained, the key to resolving these diseases isn\u2019t vaccines and drugs but help with basic sanitation:9\n\nAfter being named a U.S. Science Envoy and spearheading \u201cvaccine diplomacy\u201d in the Middle East and North Africa, Hotez bragged in 2014, \u201cVaccine science diplomacy could also lead to the development and testing of some highly innovative neglected disease vaccines.\u201d10\n\nThe Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa that same year provided this opportunity, according to Cohen. Troops were sent to Liberia, which Hotez described as \u201ca mechanism to bring in new interventions, new drugs, new vaccines that you couldn\u2019t bring in otherwise, in a very chaotic situation.\u201d11\n\nFauci then announced a \u201cvery much expanded clinical trial in West Africa, likely in Liberia,\u201d and the U.S. gave $6 billion in funding toward these efforts.12 G. Kevin Donovan, a bioethicist with Georgetown University Medical Center, spoke out against the trials, stating:13\n\nAfter the Ebola crisis passed without a vaccine being developed, Hotez pivoted, rebranding his shots as \u201cmalnutrition vaccines\u201d and writing in September 2022, \u201cThere are at least 20 promising malnutrition vaccine candidates\u201d \u2026 that \u201ccould be accelerated to help avert an imminent food catastrophe or even potential mass starvation events.\u201d14\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, Hotez has \u201cbecome an evangelist for the emergent biomedical security regime, attacking anyone who deviates from its diktats,\u201d part 2 of Cohen\u2019s investigation explains.15\n\nThe World Health Organization even posted a video16 on Twitter featuring Hotez, in which he refers to vaccine safety advocates as \u201canti-science aggressors\u201d \u2014 a term he coined in a 2021 article17 \u2014 and claims \u201canti-vaccine activism\u201d has become \u201ca major killing force globally.\u201d18 According to Hotez, 200,000 Americans lost their lives to COVID-19 because they refused the experimental COVID jab.\n\nHotez goes on to claim that \u201canti-science now kills more people than gun violence, global terrorism, nuclear proliferation or cyberattacks.\u201d Kirsch noted:19\n\nIndeed, Hotez has suggested \u201canti-science\u201d agendas be punished as hate crimes and the U.S. government should censor \u201canti-science terrorist groups.\u201d20 Dr. Pierre Kory explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a demonization of very credible people who are actually experts at the science of vaccines and have developed appropriate questions and concerns. And he dismisses them as an enemy.\n\nAnd he calls upon even security agencies to coordinate and go after these people who are actually practicing science.\u201d21 Urso then states, \u201cSomebody like this not only wants to deny the science, but wants to put people like me in jail and make us lose our license. This is a true sociopath. This is German level sociopathy.\u201d22\n\nHotez Is a Puppet for the Deep State\n\nIn repeatedly trying to equate vaccine safety advocates with global terrorists who are \u201cweaponizing\u201d health communications, it becomes clear that Hotez isn\u2019t acting alone.\n\n\u201cHotez consistently cites the U.S. government, its intelligence cutouts and proxies. His claims about Russian interference cite a dubious report from Novetta, a contractor for numerous branches of the U.S. military, owned by a firm called Accenture, which is tied to U.S. intelligence and the World Economic Forum,\u201d the investigation notes.23\n\nDr. Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine core platform technology,24 questions, \u201cIs Peter really fully independent? Is he acting as an independent agent in good conscience and academic? Or is he deeply tied to the Deep State in the intelligence community?\u201d25\n\nAlong with acting as a steady voice spreading COVID jab propaganda throughout the pandemic, Hotez succeeded in getting his previously failed Corbevax COVID-19 shot into the arms of 70 million people in India. According to the investigation:26\n\nHotez \u2018Should Be Nowhere Near Power\u2019\n\nCohen describes the idea of Hotez getting appointed to replace Fauci as \u201cterrifying.\u201d Hotez has expert knowledge \u2014 having testified to Congress in 2020 about the specific risks of coronavirus shots. He knows the risks of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and that COVID-19 shots could worsen disease if the recipient is exposed to circulating virus.\n\nHe also knows about original antigenic sin, or immune imprinting, which may make COVID shots updated to include COVID-19 variants ineffective and may increase susceptibility to infection instead of lowering it. But he chooses not to tell people about these risks. Worse still, he wants anyone who tries to get the word out thrown in jail and punished.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who \u2026 is a political actor,\u201d Cohen says. \u201cHe \u2026 is basically an agent of the Deep State \u2026 and he loves power \u2026 this is someone who should be nowhere near power.\u201d27 It seems, however, that he\u2019s been groomed as a Fauci replacement for years, maybe decades, and could easily be supplanted to continue the Deep State agenda.
