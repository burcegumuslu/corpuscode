In his petition, Puliyel had cited the example of The Wire Science\u2019s report on Corbevax that revealed that the government had cleared the vaccine\u2019s use among those aged 12-14 years without the NTAGI\u2019s approval.\n\nThe Wire Science\u2019s report had included comments from an extant NTAGI member, Jayaprakash Muliyil, to this effect. However, the Indian government claimed to the Supreme Court that all vaccines had been approved by NTAGI, an ICMR scientist familiar with the matter confirmed to The Wire Science that minutes of NTAGI meetings had never been uploaded on the ICMR site as said by government. Second, both Muliyil and another NTAGI member also confirmed that the body\u2019s top-most panel (in a three-tier setup) had not approved the use of Corbevax among children.\n\nPuliyel, the petitioner, also contended in court that the system for \u2018adverse events following immunisation\u2019 (AEFIs) has been dysfunctional in the case of COVID-19 vaccination in India. He called it non-transparent because \u201cinvestigation done to know the cause of deaths following vaccination was obscure\u201d. Currently, it is only possible to report an AEFI through a helpline number provided on the CoWIN portal. If a vaccinator or district immunisation officer learns of an AEFI, she can also report it through CoWIN. It also said that the Union health ministry website \u201ccarries the results of causality assessment of AEFI cases, from which the public can obtain relevant information pertaining to AEFIs\u201d, according to the court\u2019s order. This is not true. There has been no such information on the Union health ministry website (as of May 5, 7:30 am).\n\nThird, the court refused to entertain Puliyel\u2019s request that the primary data from the clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines be placed in the public domain because doing so would violate the privacy of the trials\u2019 participants. Instead, the court said it was satisfied with the scientific papers of the trials that had been published. However, a lawyer and a member of the ethics committees of various medical research institutions told The Wire Science that \u201cthere is no harm in disclosing the primary data. As far as confidentiality of the participants is concerned, it can always be protected by simply anonymising the data.\u201d The primary data refers to a clinical trial\u2019s raw data. Papers published by the trial investigators contain the analyses of this data.\n\nThis said, the court also asked the government to release the data from \u201cpost-marketing\u201d trials \u2013 i.e. trials conducted after a vaccine\u2019s real-world use \u2013 of Covishield and Covaxin \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-05-05T05:58:32+00:00"}
