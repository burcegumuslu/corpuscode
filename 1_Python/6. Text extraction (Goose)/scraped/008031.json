I specifically asked him about flu shots, and he did not recommend it. I also have a friend who is a Dr. and her husband is a infectious disease doctor as well, and they both do not give their son's the flu shot. That should tell you something! My son is 9 and he has never received a flu shot, and won't get one this year. I did the same thing...

They were spewing the 36,000 deaths # again. I ran into this article today, just skimmed it as it's info that I have read before, but thought it may be helpful to someone else. Looks like good links are included October 2008 has been a busy month for those who want to force all Americans - especially children - to get a flu shot every year. It doesn't matter if scientific studies have failed to prove that influenza vaccine is effective in children or many adults. It doesn't matter that flu vaccines during the past few years have been essentially worthless because they have not matched circulating strains of Type A and B influenza viruses. And apparently it also doesn't matter if the mortality statistic the flu police cling to - \"36,000 annual deaths from influenza\" - is scientifically correct or just hype, especially in light of the fact that only about 20 percent of all flu-like illness is actually caused by \"influenza.\"", "opengraph": {"title": "Flu shot and Booster?", "type": "website", "url": "https://latitudes.org/forums/topic/4016-flu-shot-and-booster/", "description": "My daughter never received the flu shot but received the booster...I changed my mind later on and never went back.
