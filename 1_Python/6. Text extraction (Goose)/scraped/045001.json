Crossing into Jordan to visit Petra, exploring the ancient quarry of Zedekiah\u2019s Cave in Jerusalem, seeing the rugged majesty of Solomon\u2019s Pillars \u2013 there were many unforgettable moments. The Lord blessed us with a whole new family of friends as we worshipped and toured together.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this tour to change me, but it did. I can\u2019t really say an exact moment during the trip where I realized something switched. I think Jesus just revealed Himself to me throughout it. Seeing how the people a part of this ministry, along with the diverse group of young adults who were on this tour walk so closely with Christ truly inspired me in my walk.\u201d \u201cOur Bible Experience Tour was truly life changing. Amir\u2019s passion for his country and God\u2019s Word brought every place we visited to life. Each day, we soaked in more of what God had in store for us. The country itself, together with Amir\u2019s insightful teachings, has forever turned our Bibles from black and white to full technicolor. We loved it so much, we returned 8 months later for the Alumni tour. Thank you Behold Israel for making this all possible.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "website", "title": "Behold Israel - A Non Profit Teaching Ministry", "description": "Behold Israel is a non-profit organization.
