One of the authors of the paper is Peter Doshi, an associate editor of the British Medical Journal.\n\nUsing a prespecified list of adverse events of special interest (\u201cAESI\u201d) identified by the Brighton Collaboration, the study found a higher risk of serious AESI in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine group relative to placebo in both the Pfizer and Moderna adult phase III trials.\n\n\u201cThese results raise concerns that mRNA vaccines are associated with more harm than initially estimated at the time of emergency authorisation,\u201d the study authors wrote.\n\nIn 2020, before the mass Covid injection campaign, the Brighton Collaboration created a priority list of Covid injection AESIs. This list was endorsed by the World Health Organisation. \u201cTo our knowledge, however, the list has not been applied to serious adverse events in randomised trial data,\u201d the study authors wrote.\n\nSo, the researchers adapted this list to evaluate AESIs observed in both the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Covid-19 vaccine phase III randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials on which the US Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) emergency use authorisation was based:\n\u2022 a 57 % higher risk of serious AESI in vaccinated trial participants (Pfizer);\n\u2022 a 36 % higher risk of serious AESI in vaccinated trial participants (Moderna);\n\u2022 combining the trials, there was a 43 % higher risk of serious AESI in vaccinated participants; and,\n\u2022 in both Pfizer and Moderna trials, the largest excess risk occurred in the category of coagulation disorders.\n\nThe authors also noted that \u201cCardiac disorders have been of central concern for mRNA vaccines; in the Pfizer trial more cardiovascular AESIs occurred in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, but in the Moderna trial the groups differed by only 1 case.\u201d\n\nOther key findings from the paper:\n\u2022 In the Moderna trial, the excess risk of serious AESIs (15.1 per 10,000 participants) was higher than the risk reduction for Covid hospitalisation relative to the placebo group (6.4 per 10,000 participants).\n\u2022 In the Pfizer trial, the excess risk of serious AESIs (10.1 per 10,000) was higher than the risk reduction for Covid hospitalisation relative to the placebo group (2.3 per 10,000 participants).\n\nThe study noted that SAEs were defined in the trial protocols and supplemental material. Accordingly, \u201can SAE was defined as an adverse event that results in any of the following conditions: death; life-threatening at the time of the event; inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; medically important event, based on medical judgment.\u201d\n\nThe study found that the Pfizer trial exhibited a 36 % higher risk and the Moderna trial exhibited a 6 % higher risk of SAEs in the vaccine group. Combined, there was a 16 % higher risk of SAEs in mRNA vaccine recipients.\n\nComparing their findings with the FDA\u2019s review, the study authors noted:\n\nIn their review of SAEs supporting the authorisation of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the FDA concluded that SAEs were, for Pfizer, \u201cbalanced between treatment groups,\u201d and for Moderna, were \u201cwithout meaningful imbalances between study arms.\u201d In contrast to the FDA analysis, we found an excess risk of SAEs in the Pfizer trial. Our analysis of Moderna was compatible with FDA\u2019s analysis, finding no meaningful SAE imbalance between groups.\n\nThe table below summarises the study\u2019s findings.\n\nUnder the discussion section, beginning in the fourth paragraph, the authors noted the limitations of their study, including:\n\u2022 Pfizer\u2019s trial did not report SAEs occurring past 1 month after dose 2. This reporting threshold may have led to an undercounting of serious AESIs in the Pfizer trial.\n\u2022 For both studies, the limited follow-up time prevented an analysis of harm-benefit over a longer period.\n\u2022 All SAEs in their analysis met the regulatory definition of a serious adverse event, but many adverse event types that a patient may themselves judge as serious may not meet this regulatory threshold.\n\u2022 Decisions about which SAEs to include or exclude as AESIs require subjective, clinical judgements in the absence of detailed clinical information about the actual SAEs.\n\u2022 A lack of access to individual participant data, which forced them to use a conservative adjustment to the standard errors, \u201cThe 95 % CIs calculated are therefore only approximate because we do not know which patients had multiple events.\u201d\n\u2022 In the Moderna analysis, the SAEs that were sequelae of serious Covid-19 could not be identified and therefore remain included in their calculations.\n\nWe emphasise that our investigation is preliminary, to point to the need for more involved analysis. The risks of serious AESIs in the trials represent only group averages. SAEs are unlikely to be distributed equally across the demographic subgroups enrolled in the trial, and the risks may be substantially less in some groups compared to others. Thus, knowing the actual demographics of those who experienced an increase in serious AESI in the vaccine group is necessary for a proper harm-benefit analysis.
