It shows research now, reports Medical Xpress.\n\nIn the new study, researchers in Australia have investigated why some people who take coronavina vaccine suffer from the life-threatening condition thrombotic thrombocytope purpura (TTP), which is caused by blood clots.\n\nIn early 2021, TTP was linked to AstraZeneca\u2019s corona vaccine, which led several countries to stop using the vaccine for certain groups. The vaccine from Johnson & Johnson can also cause TTP as a side effect.\n\nThe researchers examined five patients who suffered from the life-threatening side effect and found that all carried a specific gene variant, called IGLV3-21 * 02, which occurs mainly in people of European descent.\n\nAccording to the researchers, it seems to be the gene variant in combination with the presence of unusual antibodies to a protein called PF4 that causes the life-threatening side effect.\n\nThe findings may make it possible to create a genetic screening tool to identify patients at risk for vaccination complications, the researchers write.\n\nIt also provides a unique opportunity for a targeted, specific therapy development that aims to neutralize this very harmful but very specific antibody, says researcher Jing Jing Wang.\n\nIt is amazing that a Chinese researcher (Jing Jing Wang) is more interested in the well-being of white people than white people are of themselves.\n\u2022 Scientists claim if you Dislike other people's Body Odors, you are a Racist\n\u2022 Black Florida professor Vanishes after being Accused of Faking Data in Racism Studies\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\u2022 Newly-Elected Chicago Mayor Said Black People Should be Immune from the Police\n\u2022 Ketchup, mayo and other common staple foods tainted with toxic PFAS chemicals\n\nDid you like this information?
