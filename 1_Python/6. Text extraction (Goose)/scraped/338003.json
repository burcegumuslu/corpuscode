And yet the pandemic has continued there unabated, and all that average citizens are left with is immensely curtailed freedoms.\n\nAs a glaring case in point, Israelis apparently can\u2019t even order a Big Mac from an automatic kiosk at McDonald\u2019s unless their Green Pass status is up to date. Most recently, this means a citizen has to have not just been double-jabbed, but they have to have received the booster. This also as Israel has approved a second booster for the immunocompromised and elderly.
