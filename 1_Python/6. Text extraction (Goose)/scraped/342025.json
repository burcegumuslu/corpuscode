The shortages will be even more acute if we need a variant-specific booster vaccine, since we will not have any existing supply,\u201d they warned.\n\nThey also mentioned that insufficient funding can throw a wrench into research efforts for new COVID-19 vaccines. \u201cThe [Biden] administration does not have the funding for necessary investments in research and to support development of promising new vaccine candidates. The federal government must invest in next-generation vaccines \u2026 in order to fight COVID-19 in the future.\u201d\n\nWhite House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients confirmed the lack of funds to Andy Slavitt, his former senior advisor. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have enough money for fourth [COVID-19] vaccine doses, if they\u2019re called for. We don\u2019t have the funding if we were to need a variant-specific vaccine in the future,\u201d Zients admitted during an episode of Slavitt\u2019s \u201cIn The Bubble\u201d podcast.\n\nAccording to the coordinator, 93 percent of earlier COVID-19 funding approved by Congress had already been spent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little [funds] left. The remaining funds are for areas like medical care for veterans or [Federal Emergency Management Agency] disaster relief. So we don\u2019t have good resources to draw on from the prior allocated funds, and we need to make sure that this gets funded. So it\u2019s up to Congress to either pass it on an emergency basis without offsets, or find viable offsets.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Biden administration\u2019s plea for extra funding appears to be a Herculean task as Congress has resisted it as of writing. Lawmakers are still debating how much should be allocated for new COVID-19 funding and how to pay for it. Some GOP lawmakers are asking for a better accounting of earlier funds allocated to the executive branch. (Related: Moderate Democrat Joe Manchin says he will join Republicans to kill funding for Joe Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate.)\n\nAt least four GOP senators vocally expressed opposition to the calls for new funding.\n\nAlabama Sen. Richard Shelby said: \u201cThe basic thing we ought to figure out is: Is there a need? Secondly, if there\u2019s a need, where\u2019s all the money we appropriated?\u201d The senior senator for the Yellowhammer State also serves as the top GOP lawmaker on the upper chamber\u2019s appropriations committee.\n\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney, a critic of additional COVID-19 funding, proposed that unspent money from earlier COVID-19 packages be redirected for this purpose. \u201cThe [Biden] administration needs to take the money that\u2019s been appropriated and use that to prepare for what might be coming down the road, if there are new [SARS-CoV-2] variants that affect a lot of Americans,\u201d Romney said.\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso agreed with Romney on repurposing unspent funds. \u201cWe were very clear you need to repurpose money that has not been spent, that is out there, and it seems like the administration is not willing to do that,\u201d said the senior senator for the Equality State.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz had strong words for the administration, denouncing it for seeking new money amid \u201cthe highest inflation rate in 40 years.\u201d He commented: \u201cThere are billions and billions of dollars the administration still hasn\u2019t spent from their last boondoggle \u2013 and yet they\u2019re asking for more billions and at the same time scratching [its head] in wonderment that inflation is out of control.\u201d Cruz added that repurposing unspent money \u201ccould well make sense, but the Democrats don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nVisit Pandemic.news for more stories like this.\n\nWatch former Kentucky Rep.
