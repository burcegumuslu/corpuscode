God Is in the Science of Mathematics If math is an invention of many human minds, then why should all these minds agree on what is correct? The Christian philosophy of math begins with God, who numbered the days of creation as recorded in Genesis 1. The founder of the true philosophy of math is Jesus Christ. We don\u2019t have to abandon all the work of secular scientists; we can often co-opt their work into a biblical worldview. I could now walk into any museum and\u2014exercising caution and discernment\u2014imagine how some of the reconstructed scenes could have been part of Noah\u2019s world. Creation researchers have been studying the biblical record and the world around us to understand the history that God\u2019s Word records. While some of their theories have been discarded as new data came to light, other predictions have been powerfully confirmed.\n\u2022 God made living things to reproduce according to their kind. The taxonomic science of baraminology seeks to classify modern and fossil organisms within their original kinds.\n\u2022 Secular scientists often boldly declare that creationists aren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d scientists. History and many modern, well-educated scientists would disagree!\n\u2022 Why Do So Many Reject Creation Science? Why do 98% of professional scientists accept evolution? This page seeks to answer these questions by documenting the behavior of opponents of young-earth creation science.\n\u2022 Many of the common perceptions of creation and arguments against creation are merely misrepresentations of the true creationist position.\n\u2022 For many years, creation researchers have been studying the biblical record and the world around us to understand the history that God\u2019s Word records.\n\u2022 Can Statistics Tell Us Whether Dinosaurs Had Feathers? What are the limitations and possible pitfalls of statistical baraminology?\n\u2022 How God is the ultimate foundation for mathematics. Math has sometimes been revered as supreme and final truth...until a mathematician proved we must look higher.\n\u2022 Researchers are attempting to take species closely related to extinct ones and, using DNA from preserved specimens, to recreate the extinct species.\n\u2022 A name like \u201cCreation Research, Science Education Foundation (CRSEF)\u201d may not capture much attention. But dinosaurs sure will.\n\u2022 Several scientists share their favorite examples of Bible-based predictions that led to demonstrably true scientific discoveries.\n\u2022 Dr. David DeWitt responds to claims that the creation model is not scientific and does not make predictions.\n\u2022 from Did God Use Evolution? Certain statements which appear constantly in evolutionist publications, should make us prick up our ears.\n\u2022 10 Basics Every Creationist Must Know Every Christian who stands unashamedly on the authority of God\u2019s Word should be ready to show how the Bible unlocks our understanding of the world.\n\u2022 A creationist dig site in eastern Wyoming has set a new standard of excellence in fossil fieldwork.\n\u2022 To understand fossils, we either begin with God\u2019s Word or with human opinion that rejects God\u2019s Word. Our starting point makes all the difference in the world.\n\u2022 from Did God Use Evolution? Bible-believing Christians ought to know that there are no scientific philosophical objections today which prohibit the use of the Bible for explaining the facts of nature (creation science).\n\u2022 The more I learn about creation science, the more excited I get about my Savior and my God.\n\u2022 Why the Land of Milk and Honey Is Now a Desert In the biblical view of history after the Flood, how is it possible that the dry Middle East of today was once fertile?\n\u2022 Look Only at Spiritual Fruit? Does spiritual fruit trump disdain for the clear teachings of Scripture? Tim Chaffey, AiG\u2013U.S., shows why faith in Christ and adherence to His Word must work together.\n\u2022 After finding our site, a reader claims to have had his good day ruined because of our \u201cbrainwashing.\u201d Bodie Hodge, AiG\u2013U.S., answers his objections and points him to \u201cgoodness\u201d that won\u2019t fade.\n\u2022 Is There an \u201cUltimate Proof of Creation\u201d? Many creationists are looking for a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d to prove creation is true. The proof, however, is not simply in the evidence.\n\u2022 Can scientists be unbiased? What are the limits of science? And were earlier scientists simply cowed into creationism by the Inquisition?\n\u2022 It has always been an interesting historical point that the contemporary creation movement began not in the pulpit, but in the laboratory.\n\u2022 What is the nature of truth? Can facts be refuted by science? Roger Patterson, AiG\u2013U.S., addresses an attack on his book series Evolution Exposed.\n\u2022 By going back to God's Word, we can see the world much more clearly.\n\u2022 Science is an essential activity of the church.\n\u2022 The editor of the Answers Research Journal has received and identified the first attempt at scamming the journal.\n\u2022 Does creation and a young universe, as revealed in the Bible, require \u201cconvoluted theories\u201d to deal with the facts? Dr. Jason Lisle, AiG\u2013U.S., responds.\n\u2022 Sometimes critics of Creation refer to the creation/evolution debate as \u201cscience vs. the Bible\u201d or \u201creasoning vs. faith.\u201d Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\u2022 Would you like to see more creation material in your local public library or school library?\n\u2022 from The New Answers Book 1 When answering questions about the creation/evolution issue, I have often been accused of believing some strange things.\n\u2022 If scientific evidence causes a creationist model to change, we should not let that shake our confidence in the accuracy and authority of Scripture.\n\u2022 from The New Answers Book 1 The laws of nature are perfectly consistent with biblical creation, and pose a serious problem for naturalism.\n\u2022 Are we all confused about biology, geology, and evolution?\n\u2022 \u201cPutting Science and Its Studies in Their Proper Place\u201d \u201cIt is about time someone really pointed out the fallacy that medicine and other science's cannot survive without the belief in evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhy Are You so Bothered?\u201d If we are creationists, does that mean we lack faith?\n\u2022 The claims of evolutionists and some old-earth creationists that young-earth creationists don't have real degrees and don't do real scientific research that can be published are simply not true.\n\u2022 Grand Canyon: A Different View is back in the headlines in America with a dispute over whether or not a federal review of the book actually took place.\n\u2022 \u201cI hope that we, the debaters, regardless of opinion, can allow our discussions to encompass two of the wonders central to the human condition - thse of friendship and of reason.\u201d\n\u2022 There has been much recent discussion about origins, how this world came into being.\n\u2022 The problem of poisons is considered, and it is concluded that a false dichotomy exists between poisonous and non-poisonous chemicals.\n\u2022 Following is a list of six words and phrases used by creationists. Pick the meaning beside each which you think comes closest to the true meaning of that word.\n\u2022 It Helps to Think Creation Can you think of one area where evolutionary thinking has ever helped? Does it make our children smarter or keep them off drugs? Does it put meat on the table or men on the moon?\n\u2022 Science teaching is made more than normally important, because science in the modern world has for many replaced God as the source of authority.\n\u2022 After two years of heavy involvement with the Creation Science Ministry in Queensland, I write this article to share some of our experiences and the reasons for our approach and our methods.\n\u2022 Any theory of the origin and history of life is a theory on the nature of life. Nowhere could this be more true, than theories or models or beliefs about the origin and history of man.\n\u2022 Creation is often criticized as being religious while evolution is scientific. In reality, both have religious aspects and both have points which are testable by repeatable observation.\n\u2022 Many Christians and churches cannot see the relevance of creation science.\n\u2022 Those who propose evolution of any sort (atheistic or theistic) usually raise one major criticism against creation.", "opengraph": {"title": "Creation Science", "url":
