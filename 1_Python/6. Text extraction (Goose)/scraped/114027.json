Perhaps you\u2019ve heard some of these claims.\n\nThat Bill Gates is the anti-Christ ushering in the One World Order.\n\nThat Dr. Anthony Fauci is a conspirator with Bill Gates and \u201cBig Pharma.\u201d\n\nThat COVID-19 is one of the great plagues prophesied in the Bible.\n\nThat a House resolution with the number 6666 is a sure sign of the end times.\n\nThat any vaccine that emerges during this pandemic is part of the conspiracy to lead people to bow down to the beast described in the book of Revelation.\n\nPerhaps there is a sense of doomsday in many people today\u2013regardless of whether they\u2019re Christian or not. According to YouGov, an international research data and analytics group headquartered in London, \u201cNearly three in 10 (29%) US adults think it\u2019s likely that there will be an apocalyptic disaster in their lifetime. And 17 percent of Americans say that they have an apocalypse survival plan for their family.\u201d\n\nFurther, \u201cin a YouGov survey conducted in late February, at a time when several dozen cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in the US, nearly one in five (19%) Americans said they believed a global pandemic was the most likely cause of the apocalypse.\u201d\n\nThe Return of Christ Is Central to Christian Teachings\n\nChristians are definitely prone to doomsday theories because a central teaching in the Bible is that Jesus Christ will someday return to Earth in a doomsday setting. Christians are encouraged to be ready for these events. Jesus Himself said, \u201cTherefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect\u201d (Matthew 24:44).", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Not All Christians Believe Bill Gates Is the Anti-Christ (and Other End-Time Theories)", "description": "Christians in every generation have tried to connect the cryptic images of Revelation with people and events.", "image": "https://cdn.faithit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bill-gates-fi.jpg", "url": "https://faithit.com/not-all-christians-believe-bill-gates-is-the-anti-christ-and-other-end-time-theories/", "site_name": "Faithit", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/sharefaithit", "article:published_time": "2020-05-14T10:43:15-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-06-10T20:37:16-06:00", "updated_time": "2020-06-10T20:37:16-06:00", "image:width": "707", "image:height": "398"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffaithit.com%2Fnot-all-christians-believe-bill-gates-is-the-anti-christ-and-other-end-time-theories%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Ffaithit.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2Fcropped-CNNLogo.png", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffaithit.com%2Fnot-all-christians-believe-bill-gates-is-the-anti-christ-and-other-end-time-theories%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Ffaithit.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2Fcropped-CNNLogo.png", "https://christiannewsnow.com/", "https://faithit.com/become-a-contributor/", "https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/03/18/apocalypse-climate-change-pandemic-coronavirus", "https://faithit.com/not-all-christians-believe-bill-gates-is-the-anti-christ-and-other-end-time-theories/2/", "https://faithit.com/not-all-christians-believe-bill-gates-is-the-anti-christ-and-other-end-time-theories/2/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2020-05-14T10:43:15-06:00"}
