The booster is given to people who have RECEIVED the vaccine. (That\u2019s why it\u2019s a booster, right?)\n\nAnd when they tested a booster against a placebo in those people, they found a 95% reduction in disease in people who received the booster (for a total of 11 weeks after they received the booster, excluding the first week, because science \u2013 by which I mean because including that week would not help their results).\n\nWhere have you heard that figure before? Oh yeah, it is EXACTLY the same relative risk reduction they claimed in the pivotal trial last year, when they tested the INITIAL dose against placebo.\n\nThe only reasonable read is that the booster is providing (temporary) protection similar to the first two-dose series (temporarily) did AGAINST PLACEBO. But these are VACCINATED people.\n\nSo where\u2019s the protection from the initial two doses?\n\nThere is ONE difference, though. The ABSOLUTE risk appeared at least two to three times higher in the vaccinated people in this trial than in UNVACCINATED people in the initial trial \u2013 110 infections in 5,000 people in 10 weeks, compared to 162 infections in 20,000 people in about the same period.\n\nIf you are vaccinated, get ready to take boosters forever.\n\nBy the way, the press release includes NO specific safety data.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pfizer Announces Its Vaccine Is Useless 11 Months After Dosing", "description": "The only reasonable way to read its claim that booster is 19 times more effective than two doses", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/pfizer-announces-its-vaccine-is-useless-11-months-after-dosing/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4645364-450x300-2.jpg", "image:width": "450", "image:height": "300", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-10-22T12:26:22+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-22T12:26:22+02:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4645364-450x300-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-10-22T12:26:22+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-their/comments"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-10-22T12:26:22+02:00"}
