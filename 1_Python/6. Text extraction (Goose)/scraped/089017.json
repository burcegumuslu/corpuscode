Any doubts that we\u2019re in the midst of a slow-motion apocalypse are being set aside as the multicausal factors behind the sudden rise of the Zika Virus and its many, apparently long lasting and dire implications become clear. But there\u2019s another motto of equal power to meet this: the only way out is through.\n\nIf this is indeed the Sixth Mass Extinction, in the era now commonly agreed as the Anthropocene, then humanity is the metaphorical asteroid and we are in the process, not of affecting our own extinction, but \u2013 just as we effectively domesticated ourselves from savannah-dwelling upright chimps to become the ultimate world conquering, ecosystem shaping, invasive species \u2013 proving to be the selective filter that will determine the course of our race\u2019s evolution. The goal is increasingly becoming simply \u201clive through this,\u201d and the Zika Virus is the first level boss we have to defeat. The best news of all, if such a thing can be said about this is \u2013 the sole ray of light in the imminent darkness \u2013 we can only do so by rapidly beginning the process of repairing the planet. Because, however you read this situation, it\u2019s definitely sick, and it falls to us to heal it. To paraphrase once more from the comic Planetary: there\u2019s no justice, there\u2019s just us.\n\nWhilst this particular essay isn\u2019t a formal part of the Plutocratic Exit Strategy (PES) series, and should more properly be considered a continuation of the themes explored in my deep reading of the TV show Fortitude, there\u2019s definitely some overlap. The biggest point of intersection can be found in the speech from Kingsman: The Secret Service that I used to illustrate PES: Pt2. For our purposes here it\u2019s really worth listening to again\u2026 for one part in particular.\n\nThe Kingsman film is already considered a cannon telling of the Elite\u2019s plans in many conspiratorial-minded circles. The principal question to be answered in this exploration of the Zika Virus is who\u2019s got the upper hand right now? Is the virus killing the host, or vice versa? Is the Zika Virus a natural \u2013 whatever \u201cnatural\u201d actually means in the context of the Anthropocene \u2013 consequence of climate chaos, or the direct result of the covert machinations of corporate interests; specifically in this case, Big Pharma in general, and two Plutocrats in particular: Bill & Melinda Gates.\n\nExcept \u201cor\u201d is exactly the wrong word here, the incorrect logic\u2026 this is after all slow-motion apocalypse, which the Zika Virus is just one symptom of. Before we go any further, we need to extend our apocalyptic lexicon and appreciate just what it is to be living within the Churn.\n\nAs I\u2019m wont to do, I\u2019m going to lean on the words of a friend and fellow writer here, and let Cat Vincent explain the full meaning and origin of the phrase I opened this essay with, quoting at length from his recent newsletter on the subject:\n\n\u201cBetting on the future where you survive makes more sense than the one where you don\u2019t\u201d. Amen brother. We need the words to describe our situation though, so we can chart our course through it. There\u2019s a reason those old maps noted where all the dragons were. For me, as we sketch out the territory we must navigate, the Churn maps perfectly on to the overall period William Gibson described as the Jackpot Years in The Peripheral. I\u2019m going to pull a quote from that book where he elaborates on the nature of a multicausal, feedback loop deathspiral; one that I\u2019ve used here before, and may well do so again.\n\nWhy is this quote such a touchstone for me? Well, for one thing, it almost perfectly captures the circumstances that have given risen to what\u2019s looking to be exactly one of those \u201cdisease that were never quite the one big pandemic\u201d, as the result of many of the other factors. Just everything else\u2026\n\nThe Zika Virus is letting everyone give full voice to project their eschatonic ideologies and apocalyptic mindsets to any audience that will listen. The mainstream media depiction is of the host, the planetary superorganism, Gaia, finally repelling the human infection. Dig deeper though and a far darker narrative emerges of this all being the direct result of the bleeding edge of anthropocentric activity, genetically modified organisms, industrial farming and gross negligence. A climatological horror story is one that begins merely with intersection of natural forces;a reboot of the classic trope of Nature vs Man: Nature\u2019s Revenge.\n\nUnderstand why the Churn and the Jackpot Years are quickly becoming the shorthand to discuss the current condition? Just count up all the factors there and tell me the Zika Virus isn\u2019t, at minimum, the worst side-effect of humankind\u2019s continual failure to act as effective planetary custodians.\n\nThe literal geological marker of this period I hopefully characterise as being the Immature Anthropocene, implying we might actually survive to get better at all this world management business, is a world littered by plastic\u2026 the very thing the Zika Virus bearing mosquitoes are breeding in across the Americas.\n\nThe, um, kinda good news is that the Elite kicking around recently at Davos are all over this\u2026 sort of. When you\u2019re at an economic forum every solution looks, strangely enough, economic. They look at oceans where the plastic content will soon outweigh the fish in it and just see inefficiency and potentially lost profits:\n\nI don\u2019t think its too cynical to read this as treating the symptoms, but ignoring the disease. And as hard as I\u2019d looked into this, whilst they talk about reducing the plastification of the planet, I could find no mention of reversing it. Instead, for hopeful narratives of a course through, we have to turn back to life on the other side of the Jackpot Years, as Gibson conjures it for us:\n\nThe patchers, their prime directive to cleanse the fouled water column, had assembled this place from recovered polymers. What shape it had taken was afterthought, offhand gesture, however remarkably unattractive. It made him want to shower. Coffee was starting to seep through the front of his robe. Now Daedra was being helped to don her parafoil, which in its furled state resembled a bilobed scarlet backpack, bearing the white logo of its makers. \u201cIs the \u2019foil her placement,\u201d he asked, \u201cor ours?\u201d The cams halted abruptly, simultaneously finding one another over the chosen square. Descended, above diagonally opposite corners, each capturing the other\u2019s identical image. They were skeletal oblongs, the size of a tea tray, matte gray, around a bulbous little fuselage. Either Lorenzo or Rainey brought the audio up. The square filled with a low moaning, the island\u2019s hallmark soundscape. The patchers had wormed hollow tubes through every structure. Wind blew across their open tops, generating a shifting, composite tonality he\u2019d hated from the moment he\u2019d first heard it. \u201cDo we need that?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s so much of the feel of the place. I want our audience to have that.\u201d Something was moving in the distance, to his left. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Four meters tall, headless, with some indeterminate number of legs, it was that same hollow milky plastic. Like the discarded carapace of something else, moving as if animated by an awkward puppetry. It rocked from side to side as it advanced, a garden of tubes atop its length no doubt contributing to the song of the plastic island. \u201cHave they sent it here?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThey set them free, to wander with the wind.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want it in the frame.\u201d \u201cNow you\u2019re the director?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want it in the frame,\u201d he said. The thing went stiffly on, swaying, on its hollow translucent legs.\n\n On the upper deck of the moby, he saw, her support staff had been withdrawn. The white china Michikoid remained, checking the parafoil, hands and fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision. The ribbon on its sailor cap fluttered in the breeze. A real one, the cam with the fan absent now. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d said Rainey, and he saw the first of the patchers, one cam shifting focus. A child. Or something the size of one. Hunched over the handlebars of a ghostly little bike, the bike\u2019s frame the same salt-crusted translucence as the city and the wind-walker. Unpowered, it seemed to lack pedals as well. The patcher progressed by repeatedly scuffing at the avenue\u2019s surface. The patchers repelled Netherton even more than their island. Their skin was overgrown with a tweaked variant on actinic keratosis, paradoxically protecting them from UV cancers. \u201cThere\u2019s only the one?\u201d ~ William Gibson, The Peripheral\n\nPosthumans healing the planet as an art project, building plastic islands and making sculptures from the rubble of the world-that-was. That\u2019s the kind of thing that awaits the survivors of what looks more and more like a giant selective filter in motion. The Churn. Because the first real horrific element of the tale of the Zika Virus looks like this:\n\nThat\u2019s what the next generation looks like for the Americas if nothing is done to reverse the spread of this virus, or limit its effects. 4,000 births like this were reported in Brazil last year, where this outbreak originated. Columbia has now reported over two thousand women as being infected with Zika. Government after government across the Americas are encouraging their citizens to avoid reproducing until the crisis ends and/or a cure can be found. As climate change thought leader Bill McKibben wrote in his op-ed for The Guardian on the subject:\n\nNo surprise then that people are constantly referencing the film Children of Men when discussing this online, or off. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n indeed offers a grim visage of the future that lurks over the dark horizon:\n\nAnd there is no guarantee at all that this will be limited to less developed parts of the Americas. Especially if the virus were to jump hosts to a closely related mosquito that\u2019s already established across North America.\n\nThat we can only save ourselves by finally beginning the great project of repairing the planet is the through line of hope, the opportunity within the crisis and great takeaway from all this. It\u2019s always darkest before the dawn\u2026 or to echo Cat Vincent again, from earlier: \u201cbetting on the future where you survive makes more sense than the one where you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhich brings another element that can be folded in, where this can all be the grim origin tale for a Mature Anthropocene run by a Type I Civilisation. Making a rational decision about human migration. Because if there\u2019s anyone that is betting large on their future right now, it\u2019s the displaced persons across the world risking everything for the chance of at life under better circumstances. The people formerly of Syria, for instance. If the Zika Virus plays out as expected, and for years no one has children, the governments of the Americas have a new generation waiting to be imported from the other side of the world. A far more inviting and permanent journey for them to take, versus the temporary asylum Germany has offered to over a million and made a point of emphasising it\u2019s temporary nature:\n\nReturning to what exactly? I see no Marshall-esque plan being set in motion, after all.\n\nImagine images of Syrian refugees being flown to the Americas from Turkey and elsewhere on our screens, instead of the constant news footage of drowned women and children. It would be a radical act to many, but the governments that do it would find themselves with a grateful injection of talented people almost certainly ready to undertake any ambitious task. Like, I don\u2019t know, returning the Amazon rain forest to it\u2019s former glory as a great, vast garden. If only the politicians in places such as Brazil can look past the short term consequences such as the likelihood that the Corpocratic Invasion that is the Olympics will be a complete disaster \u2013 no Westerner vaguely contemplating children will risk attending this year \u2013 and see the long game instead.\n\nThis is a far more inviting future to contemplate, versus a near future with Trump as POTUS, building a Walled America, patrolled by drones with The Gates Foundation\u2019s mosquito zapping lasers.\n\nAs we\u2019ll shortly explore, this might just be the least bleak reading of the future, as we continue tumbling down the Zika Wormhole.\n\nAnd so we come to consider the words and acts of billionaire philanthropists, Bill & Melinda Gates, and the rather suspect field trials of a branch of Big Pharma. Bill Gates seeded his global charity with what would to others be a large chunk of his Microsoft stock, and still sits comfortably atop the world\u2019s richest list. His new mission in life involves such world changing goals as ridding the world of Malaria. You can listen to him talk about his bucketlist in this TED Talk, where he pulls cool stunts like releasing a swarm of mosquitoes into the audience. There\u2019s one quote we need to pull out here though, because as we\u2019ll shortly see, it foreshadows just what might be the real story of the true origin of the Zika Virus outbreak threatening the world:\n\nRemember that part. Bill\u2019s wife and partner-in-crime\u2026 I mean, Benevolent Plutocratic Endeavours\u2026 Melinda Gates recently gave a TED Talk herself. Depending on how you read this \u2013 via whatever reality tunnel you view it through \u2013 it\u2019s either an act of Noblesse Oblige, or one of the greatest recent instances of Plato\u2019s Noble Lie. Especially once we call back again to Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s words in the Kingsman film: \u201cA cull is our only hope.\u201d Seen through supervillain lens, this is one ominous speech:\n\nSince we\u2019re essentially creating another intersection with the Plutocratic Exit Strategy series here, it\u2019s worth pointing out the other instances where it sure looks like a cull is being effected, if not by intention, then by neglect; a consequence of the chaos caused by the looting of the world. Take Flint, Michigan and the other places in North American beset by toxic water:\n\nWe really can\u2019t blame Gaia\u2019s natural immune response on such things. It\u2019s unquestionably the result of a broken civilisation, falling back into the abyss of Collapse. Whilst the Exit to Mars marches on:\n\nBut as I\u2019ve already said, this isn\u2019t another PES installment. Pay no attention to the wizard behind the curtain. Especially when the rest of what they\u2019re pitching fits perfectly in with your anarchist transhumanist belief system. As Tim Maly wrote on the subject in his piece \u201cSix Radical Life-Extension Technologies for Transhumanist Consideration\u201d, listing Clean Water and Basic Sanitation as the top two pieces of radical tech.\n\nSo when Melinda Gates says the following, I\u2019m almost ready to swallow the rest of what she has to say:\n\nThis has, after all, been a priority for such past civilisations as the Roman Empire and the residents of the Indus Valley during the Bronze Age. So why can\u2019t get we it right, here in the Peak Anthropocene? It\u2019s a pretty freaking valid question. Thankfully there are some people working on resolving this problem\u2026 again. Researchers from Standford are field testing an innovative clean water solution in the slums of Bangladesh:\n\nJust the kind of technology that might be handy for a climate chaos ridden (broken) Refugee/Favela Planet. Another regretful necessity. Maybe the Gates Foundation can help them out? That would be nice, right? A nice hopeful thought to pause on before we descend into the very depths of the Zika Wormhole. Because it seems a very different field test has been going on in Brazil, and would you just guess what might be the result? Brace yourself for Full Anthropocene Horror and please adjust your conspiratorial hats before reading on.\n\nHere\u2019s someone on Reddit breaking it down really simply (I\u2019ve put the maps they mention in above this quote):\n\nThis far more expansive article at AntiMedia took that post and really ran with it. It\u2019s actually a pretty harrowing read that makes the Flint, Michigan & fellow cities seem almost benign by comparison. This is the Churn, people. The only peace we find is in the eye of the storm. Remember a few thousand words ago when we were just worried about plastic and clean water acting an ace incubator for a swarm of infectious mosquitoes? It\u2019s so much worse than that. Maybe. (VERY PROBABLY.) Like, that little fact about tetracycline? Read on for a full elaboration:\n\nThe particular strain of Oxitec GM mosquitoes, OX513A, are genetically altered so the vast majority of their offspring will die before they mature \u2014 though Dr. Ricarda Steinbrecher published concerns in a report in September 2010 that a known survival rate of 3-4 percent warranted further study before the release of the GM insects. Her concerns, which were echoed by several other scientists both at the time and since, appear to have been ignored \u2014 though they should not have been. Those genetically-modified mosquitoes work to control wild, potentially disease-carrying populations in a very specific manner. Only the male modified Aedes mosquitoes are supposed to be released into the wild \u2014 as they will mate with their unaltered female counterparts. Once offspring are produced, the modified, scientific facet is supposed to \u2018kick in\u2019 and kill that larvae before it reaches breeding age \u2014 if tetracycline is not present during its development . But there is a problem. According to an unclassified document from the Trade and Agriculture Directorate Committee for Agriculture dated February 2015, Brazil is the third largest in \u201cglobal antimicrobial consumption in food animal production\u201d \u2014 meaning, Brazil is third in the world for its use of tetracycline in its food animals. As a study by the American Society of Agronomy, et. al., explained, \u201cIt is estimated that approximately 75% of antibiotics are not absorbed by animals and are excreted in waste.\u201d One of the antibiotics (or antimicrobials) specifically named in that report for its environmental persistence is tetracycline. In fact, as a confidential internal Oxitec document divulged in 2012, that survival rate could be as high as 15% \u2014 even with low levels of tetracycline present. \u201cEven small amounts of tetracycline can repress\u201d the engineered lethality. Indeed, that 15% survival rate was described by Oxitec: \u201cAfter a lot of testing and comparing experimental design, it was found that [researchers] had used a cat food to feed the [OX513A] larvae and this cat food contained chicken. It is known that tetracycline is routinely used to prevent infections in chickens, especially in the cheap, mass produced, chicken used for animal food. The chicken is heat-treated before being used, but this does not remove all the tetracycline. This meant that a small amount of tetracycline was being added from the food to the larvae and repressing the [designed] lethal system. \u201d Even absent this tetracycline, as Steinbrecher explained, a \u201csub-population\u201d of genetically-modified Aedes mosquitoes could theoretically develop and thrive, in theory, \u201ccapable of surviving and flourishing despite any further\u201d releases of \u2018pure\u2019 GM mosquitoes which still have that gene intact. She added, \u201cthe effectiveness of the system also depends on the [genetically-designed] late onset of the lethality. If the time of onset is altered due to environmental conditions \u2026 then a 3-4% [survival rate] represents a much bigger problem\u2026\u201d\n\n: They seriously built a fucking super bug! Like, they could not have fucked this up more if they tried!!! Did they?!?! This is some full X-Files conspiracy type shit. In fact, forget that, it\u2019s now a race between reality and the new season of the televisual adaptation of 12 Monkeys to show us what near-human extinction via engineered plague looks like:\n\nRemember what Bill Gates warned about earlier with respect to the proposed engineered Malaria cure? That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done! Instead of killing off the Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes they\u2019ve created a stronger, tougher, more resilient version through artificially accelerating its evolution. And that\u2019s where this all came from\u2026 they\u2019ve been breeding in the jungles of Brazil and now they\u2019re swarming across the Americas. Now, don\u2019t forget how they got there in the first place, those only slightly infectious original insect population\u2026 through the holds of ships and infected passengers.\n\nDon\u2019t worry though, it\u2019s so much worse. A cool way to put out a fire is to pour oil on it, right?\n\nAnd since this is all super-cutting edge anthropocene horror tech, they\u2019re not even charging people for it, but doing this all by donation. Almost like there\u2019s a greater agenda at work, and this is just one field trial in motion.\n\nI really wish I was making this all up. It\u2019s so much more fun to dissect TV shows about frozen mammoths carrying fictional plagues, than frantically writing to your friends encouraging them to get at least a continent away from the outbreak zone. 2016 is just getting started. Now with the best news of all, yeah, I saved it for last. According to one expert, it\u2019s not Zika that we should really be worried about\u2026\n\nI\u2019m going to end now and leave the vaccine part of the Zika Wormhole to another writer. I\u2019ll just note in passing, before concluding that some very interesting wearable tech is being developed, that might prove to have, um, critical applications in an increasingly Churning, plague ridden world.\n\nAnd such is life in the Churn, as we find a path through the Jackpot Years and seek out the seeds of a better world. In the words of King Krule: \u201ccause if you\u2019re going through hell, we just keep going\u2026\u201d\n\nSpecial Acknowledgement to my Dark Extropian compatriot, Emily Dare, for sending me much deeper down this wormhole than I really intended to go.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nightmares of the Future: CLIMATOLOGICAL HORRORS - The Zika Virus - The Daily Grail", "description": "There\u2019s a line from the new space opera, The Expanse, that\u2019s quickly becoming a grim shorthand for the futurepresent: Welcome to the Churn.
