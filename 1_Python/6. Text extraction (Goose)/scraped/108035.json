The move would be a crucial step in tackling PFAS contamination.\n\nIn their letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan, the House lawmakers say they recognize the Biden administration\u2019s accelerated efforts across the federal government to tackle PFAS. But they also emphasize the need for additional agency action.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for your commitment and efforts to address the PFAS crisis in the United States. As more and more communities nationwide discover PFAS contamination, the greater the need grows for federal action,\u201d says the letter to Regan, which is signed by Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the energy committee\u2019s Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and dozens of other lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe urge you and the administration to follow through on your commitment by designating the two most harmful \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 \u2013 PFOA and PFOS \u2013 as the hazardous substances we know they are as expeditiously as possible,\u201d the letter says.\n\nDesignating a substance hazardous under CERCLA does not ban its use, and many such chemicals remain on the market and are widely used in commercial products.\n\nThe designation would be an important step toward helping hold polluters accountable, encouraging more responsible stewardship of these chemicals, and cleaning up contaminated sites.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Rep. Dingell and Chairs Pallone and Tonko for making PFAS a priority and urging the EPA to move swiftly on this designation. PFAS are forever and everywhere; as more communities nationwide identify PFAS pollution, this designation will help them to ensure their communities get cleaned up and polluters are held accountable,\u201d said Jay Lucey, EWG legislative director.\n\nEWG estimates that more than 200 million Americans could be drinking tap water contaminated with PFAS. PFAS have been linked to serious health concerns, including cancer, harm to fetal development and reduced vaccine effectiveness.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.
