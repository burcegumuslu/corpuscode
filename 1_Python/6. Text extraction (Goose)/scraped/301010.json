Vaccine clinics could always predict it, but they could never explain it.\n\n\u201cThe question is does the inflammation drive the depression or vice versa or is it just a coincidence?\n\n\u201cIn experimental medicine studies if you treat a healthy individual with an inflammatory drug, like interferon, a substantial percentage of those people will become depressed. So we think there is good enough evidence for a causal effect.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a 20-year study, concluded in June \u2014 which noted similar results \u2014 described the necessity for and promise of the same focus of study championed by Bullmore, stating,\n\n\u201cThe field has burgeoned in the last few years, and we have now clear translational opportunities for psychoneuroimmunology and immunopsychiatry to help patients, delivering both predictive biomarkers to implement precision psychiatry and novel pharmacological agents that improves depression through an anti-inflammatory action.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, scientists from Cambridge University and Wellcome Trust plan to investigate anti-inflammatory medication as a means to halt depression, since, the professor notes, \u201cThere is evidence to suggest it should work.\u201d\n\nEvincing further correlation, 30 percent of those experiencing chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis also suffer from depression \u2014 a rate four times that of the normal population.\n\nBaneful though the symptoms, depression actually served a purpose. Scientists surmise the reflex to withdraw, rest, and cordon oneself from regular activity during an illness or recovery from injury would have prevented contagions from spreading to the healthy population.\n\nScientists clung to the idea of a blood-brain barrier \u2014 a distinct separation in function between the brain and immune system \u2014 but have been forced to relegate that to the dust bin as evidence mounts of their inextricable connection.\n\n\u201cAll psychiatric and neurological disorders are based in brain and brain is not static but structurally and functionally responsive to a range of biological, psychological and social issues,\u201d explained Dr. Alan Carson, Reader in Neuropsychiatry at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cYet institutionally we use an outmoded code which separates brain disorders into psychiatric \u2018f\u2019 codes and neurological \u2018g\u2019 codes which holds back both scientific and clinical progress.\u201d\n\nRevealing evidence inflammation can drive depression was the first step; now, scientists hope for more meticulous research to use that information for treating the ailment efficaciously.\n\nIt should be noted the connection now prominently featured in a growing body of research does not preclude or supplant additional causes of depression, nor current treatment models.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sad-2635043_1920.jpg", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2017/09/isnt-head-depression-actually-physical-illness-caused-inflammation.html", "title": "It Isn't All In Your Head: Depression Is Actually a Physical Illness Caused by Inflammation", "description": "For years, the scientific community focused almost exclusively on brain chemistry as the likely cause of depression; but new research upends this longheld premise, suggesting inflammation sparked by an immune system in overdrive \u2014 a root, physical origin \u2014 is instead responsible for associated feelings of despair, distress, and hopelessness.
