Though the CDC has issued a formal apology regarding the issue for this season, flu vaccinations have long been seen as ineffective by a horde of experts. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 here you will find more than 20 natural flu remedies using natural antivirals.\n\nNo surprise here, but there won\u2019t be any refund for insurance companies or patients who have already taken a flu vaccination early as preparation for the 2015 flu season in January and February, despite the CDC\u2019s admission of its inefficacy.\n\nAt the end of its apology, though, the CDC says that there is a \u2018cure\u2019 for the flu, but it will cost you. GlaxoSmithKline and Roche will happily provide you with two anti-viral medications for patients who come down with the flu. So even if you don\u2019t want to get the flu shot due to it being ineffective, Big Pharma will still gladly handle your case.\n\nInterestingly, the flu shot may never really be protecting you, as since there is no single virus that causes the flu, and therefore there is no one flu vaccine that protects against all of them. A virus mutates over time. It adapts. If a vaccine is created to kill one type of virus, it can mutate into another organism, specifically adapted to withstand the \u2018medicine\u2019 that was created to kill it. Biotech has simply attempted to come up with a one-dose, all-purpose vaccine that will kill every virus.\n\nIf it were truly possible to kill all viruses, none would be left on the planet. Just like humans, viruses can make mistakes in the copying of RNA or DNA, and these small mistakes can be repeated into new strains. When these mutations don\u2019t kill the organism, they replicate, making new progeny with the \u2018mistake\u2019 coding. This is why people are usually susceptible to disease \u2013 except there\u2019s a catch.\n\nInnate human immunity works with this world of strange and ever-changing viruses and microbes. It is only when our natural immunity is weakened or disturbed that the body is more likely to get the flu, or any other virus, as well as common invaders like fungi, various parasites including worms, and amoeba, and other single-celled protozoans.\n\nWe have both external protections and internal ones. A variety of enzymes contained in tears, sweat, and mucus in the digestive, respiratory, and reproductive tracts will neutralize potential invaders (that is unless they are altered by substances like glyphosate or vaccinations). Internally the phagocytes, or white blood cells, will surround the bodily invaders when our immunity is working properly.\n\nFinally, we have good microbes in our gut that work to crowd out the bad ones, and make it hard for them to live in our body. When our internal bacteria is imbalanced, we become a host for parasites or viruses.\n\nWe don\u2019t need another ineffective flu shot, a virus vaccine created by biotech, or another dose of carcinogenic chemicals created by Big Pharma. We just need to nurture our innate immunity with good habits like taking probiotics supplements and supporting immunity through natural means.\n\n\n\n Here are 21 natural anti-virals and natural flu remedies that do the trick better than any super drug developed by GlaxoSmithKline ever could. Why doesn\u2019t the CDC ever talk about these methods?\n\u2022 1. Colloidal Silver \u2013 This stuff is so powerful it has even been able to kill HIV strains. It is also anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.\n\u2022 2. Lomatium Dissectum \u2013 Lomatium is the \u201csecret\u201d anti-influenza herb that very few people know about. The root\u2019s anti-viral action is combined with a respiratory clearing action that\u2019s especially useful for dealing with the secondary infections caused by many strains of influenza.\n\u2022 3. Zinc \u2013 Zinc salts have been shown to be very effective in fighting viruses.\n\u2022 4. Green Tea \u2013 This super food, which is the least processed of all teas, has numerous health benefits; fighting viruses is among them. It has been used as an anti-viral remedy for centuries.\n\u2022 5. Lemon Balm \u2013 This anti-viral is effective against herpes viruses and many others.\n\u2022 6. Elderberry \u2013 This amazing berry can treat wounds, reduce nasal congestion, and effectively fight against colds and flu.\n\u2022 7. Olive Leaf \u2013 The ancient Egyptians considered the olive tree a symbol of heavenly power because it is a powerful immune-booster. It abounds with potent phytochemicals and powerful antioxidants that will protect you against the flu.\n\u2022 8. Pau D\u2019 Arco \u2013 Pau d\u2019Arco is effective in part through its lapacho compound \u2013 inactivating, slowing, inhibiting, killing, or stunting viruses. Viruses including: herpes virus (herpes simplex), polio virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, avian myeloblastosis virus, rauscher murine leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus, the flu virus, and many more.\n\u2022 10. Garlic \u2013 Garlic is an amazingly healthful food that can protect against, colds, the flu, and much, much more. Check out other health benefits of garlic here.\n\u2022 11. Echinacea \u2013 Extracts from 8 different Echinacea varieties have proven to have anti-viral properties.\n\u2022 12. St. John\u2019s Wort \u2013 Not only can this herb boost your mood, it is also antibacterial and antiviral.\n\u2022 13. Vitamin D \u2013 Another great vitamin to keep in your medicine cabinet, vitamin D protects against multiple viruses while preventing seasonal depressive disorder \u2013 also common during flu season.\n\u2022 14. Vitamin C \u2013 The University of Michigan says vitamin C is a powerful anti-viral.\n\u2022 15. Probiotics \u2013 Your body contains ten times more bacteria then cells. Most of them, optimally 85%, should be friendly flora. Friendly bacteria not only attack pathogenic bacteria and fungi,they also trigger appropriate white cell reactions to invaders, and they influence your mental/emotional state. It\u2019s estimated that eighty percent of your 100 trillion bacteria are located in the gut\u2019s flora.\n\u2022 16. Barley or Wheat Grass \u2013 Both of these grasses are best juiced. Wheatgrass juice is the nectar of rejuvenation, the plasma of youth, and has been called the blood of all life since it most resembles healthy human blood. Barley grass is also a natural antiviral that has been used for centuries with similar qualities. They both cleanse the lymph system, and boost immunity, too.\n\u2022 17. Ginger \u2013 We\u2019ve been talking about the benefits of ginger at Natural Society for a long time. The root contains over 14 bio-active compounds to help kill disease.\n\u2022 18. Shiitake mushrooms \u2013 Not only does these little fungi slow cancerous tumor growth, but they are great at killing viruses and bad bacteria of all kinds.\n\u2022 19. Cat\u2019s Claw \u2013 This herb boosts total immunity and the natural immune defense of the body. It grows in the Amazon, though fortunately you can get it at your local health food store.\n\u2022 20. Astragalus \u2013 Another ancient herb for healing, astragalus doubles the survival rate for cancer patients and fights numerous diseases.\n\u2022 21. Quality Sleep \u2013 Lack of sleep makes you more prone to diseases. Even a few nights of good rest can make your impervious to a cold or the flu.\n\n\n\n Sorry CDC, we aren\u2019t buying more Big Pharma meds. We\u2019ve got our own natural flu remedies in our natural antiviral arsenal. Here are 9 more ways to boost your immune system.\n\n Additional Sources:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "21 Natural Alternatives to the Flu Shot", "description": "The CDC admitted that this year\u2019s flu shot will not protect you from the flu.
