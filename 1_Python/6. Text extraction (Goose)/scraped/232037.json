They don\u2019t have most of the data. They have almost no data, except that your child has 499,999 out of 500,000 chance of surviving \u201cCovid\u201d.\n\nDo you want to risk giving your child an untested vaccine to mitigate a one in five-hundred-thousand chance?", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Coronavirus Fact-check #15: \u201cWe know all the risks of Covid vaccines\u201d", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/03/31/coronavirus-fact-check-15-we-know-all-the-risks-of-covid-vaccines/", "description": "Yesterday morning, celebrity doctor Sara Kayat appeared on GB News to defend the UK government\u2019s decision to \u201coffer\u201d coronavirus vaccinations to children between the ages of 5 and\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-03-31T11:30:55+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-31T11:01:33+00:00", "site_name": "OffGuardian", "image": "https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/adobe-stock-kid-parent-vaccine-masks-scaled.jpeg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1708", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["VAERS", "news", "covid factcheck", "bbc", "astra zeneca", "Dr Sarah Kayat", "Pfizer", "vaccines", "GB news", "JCVI"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/adobe-stock-kid-parent-vaccine-masks-scaled.jpeg", "https://twitter.com/sara_kayat", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-update-on-advice-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11/jcvi-statement-on-vaccination-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years-old", "https://twitter.com/GBNEWS/status/1509072553427537931", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57766717", "https://off-guardian.org/2021/07/29/covid-vaccines-the-leaked-pfizer-contract/", "https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf", "https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-coronavirus-pfizer-idUSL2N2VK1G1", "https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-vaccine-trial-no-animal-testing.html", "https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/03/what-vaccine-trials/", "https://ko-fi.com/offguardian", "https://www.subscribestar.com/offguardian", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bitcoin", "https://liberapay.com/OffGuardian/donate", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bank", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-03-31T11:30:55+00:00"}
