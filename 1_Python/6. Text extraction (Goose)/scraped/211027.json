However, a compound in this seaweed has been discovered to exhibit cancer-fighting properties.\n\nAn April 2020 study published in Marine Drugs elaborated on this compound called fucoidan, which wakame is a well-known source of. Aside from wakame, the study mentioned that other marine invertebrates such as the Japanese sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) and the tubular sea cucumber (Holothuria tubulosa) are also sources of fucoidan.\n\nThe study authors from three universities in Chile found that fucoidan prevents metastasis \u2013 the spread of cancer cells from a tumor site to other parts of the body \u2013 by binding to the receptors outside of these cells. With fucoidan binding to the cancer cell receptors, their possibility of breaking away from the primary tumor and settling in a different part of the body decreases.\n\nThey also found that fucoidan from wakame inhibit hypoxia \u2013 blood oxygen levels that are lower than normal \u2013 in the area surrounding a tumor. Insufficient blood oxygen levels can promote the spread of cancer cells in the body.\n\nMoreover, the researchers also noted how fucoidan prevented cancer cells from becoming resistant to certain drugs and even boosted the effects of certain anti-cancer medications, citing two examples.\n\nFirst, fucoidan from U. pinnatifida improved the effect of the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen against mouse models of breast cancer. Second, the compound from brown wakame was able to inhibit the growth of tumors caused by melanoma (a kind of skin cancer) by 85 percent when combined with the anti-melanoma drug lapatinib. Using lapatinib alone inhibited melanoma tumor growth by 60 percent, the study authors pointed out.\n\n\u201cThe molecular characteristics of fucoidans \u2026 enable chemical or enzymatic modifications, which make them good candidates for therapeutic use, or \u2026 as adjuvants to increase the therapeutic efficiency of known chemotherapeutics,\u201d the study authors concluded. \u201cStudies have demonstrated their potential to improve the efficiency of drug delivery into the tumor and/or to achieve a synergistic effect with other cancer drugs.\u201d\n\nAnother compound in wakame shown to fight obesity\n\nIncluding wakame as part of the daily diet not only gives people the positive effects of fucoidan. Another study, this time from 2005, expounded on the role of fucoxanthin \u2013 another compund in U. pinnatifida \u2013 in helping address obesity. (Related: Wakame: an iodine-rich seaweed with impressive fat burning properties.)\n\nThe July 2005 study published in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications expounded on a trial by Japanese researchers. They divided several rats into four groups, feeding prepared wakame powder to one group and different diets to the remaining three. Throughout the experimental period of four weeks, \u201cno significant differences\u201d were observed in the three control groups.\n\nThe group of mice fed with prepared wakame powder that contained fucoxanthin saw a significant decrease in white adipose tissue (WAT). Also called white fat, WAT often accumulates in the abdomen. The other three groups did not report any reduction in their white fat levels.\n\nAside from WAT levels, the Japanese study authors found mice fed with U. pinnatifida had higher levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Also called thermogenin, UCP1 plays a key role in the body\u2019s natural production of heat that burns off fat. However, UCP1 is usually expressed only in brown adipose tissue or brown fat \u2013 which adult humans have little amounts of.\n\n\u201cClear signals of UCP1 protein and mRNA were detected\u201d in the abdominal fat of the mice given wakame powder, the researchers wrote. \u201cThis result indicates that fucoxanthin up-regulates the expression of UCP1 in WAT, which may contribute to reducing WAT weight.\u201d\n\nHead over to Superfood.news for more stories about superfoods that fight cancer and obesity.\n\nWatch this video about heavy metals testing on different kinds of seaweeds, including wakame.\n\nThis video is from the Natural News channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nThe health benefits of eating seaweed: 8 reasons to eat the \u201cmost nutritious vegetable in the world.\u201d\n\nSeaweed found to accelerate excretion of dioxins from the body: STUDY.", "opengraph": {"title": "Compound in wakame seaweed found to have anticancer properties", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2023-02-28-compound-wakame-seaweed-has-anticancer-properties.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "Wakame seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida) is a staple in the Japanese diet, often served alone as a side dish or mixed in soups and stews.
