Wiggins, a forward with the Golden State Warriors, was required to accept the jab under a San Francisco vaccine mandate or be forced to sit out all of his team\u2019s home games, having been denied a religious exemption by the NBA.\n\nDuring a recent interview with the sports media site FanSided, Wiggins was asked about taking the COVID vaccine ahead of the 2021-2022 NBA season, which ended in his Golden State Warriors winning the league championship. To the apparent surprise of the FanSided interviewer, Wiggins said that he regrets taking the shot, despite his all-star season and championship run, and that he feels like he didn\u2019t really have a choice in the matter.\n\n\u201cI still wish I didn\u2019t get it, to be honest with you,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cBut you gotta do what you gotta do, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did it and I was an all-star this year, and a champion. So that was the good part, just not missing out on the year. Best year of my career,\u201d Wiggins went on, before expressing concerns about what he was forced to put in his body, saying that it \u201cwasn\u2019t my choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for my body, I just don\u2019t like putting all that stuff in my body. So I didn\u2019t like that and I didn\u2019t like that it wasn\u2019t my choice. I didn\u2019t like that,\u201d Wiggins said, remarking that he had been given an ultimatum of \u201cget this or don\u2019t play.\u201d\n\nAhead of the 2021-2022 NBA season, Wiggins\u2019 vaccine status was the topic of much media scrutiny, alongside others like Brooklyn Nets player Kyrie Irving, who has yet to accept the vaccine and successfully waited out New York City\u2019s mandate. As a member of the Golden State Warriors, Wiggins is subject to San Francisco\u2019s vaccine mandate, which bars the unvaccinated over the age of 14 from partaking in indoor events, including NBA basketball games and practices. He applied for a religious exemption from the NBA, which would have allowed him to skirt the San Fransico vaccine mandate, but was denied.\n\nWhile the NBA itself has no vaccine mandate, as the players\u2019 union has staunchly opposed them implementing one, several cities that house teams do, and the NBA has co-operated fully with them, seemingly at the expense of their own players.\n\nOther professional sports leagues have faced similar issues, notably Major League Baseball, where multiple teams\u2019 cross-border trips to play the Toronto Blue Jays have become a frequent news topic as several MLB players have been barred from entering the country due to their COVID vaccine status.\n\nRelated: Superstar MLB Catcher Doubles Down On Vaccination Stance, Refuses To Play In Canada\n\nIn the world of tennis, Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic was even detained over his vaccine status during a trip to Australia and has been barred from entering the United States to compete in the US Open under Biden\u2019s COVID rules, due to being unvaccinated.\n\nRead More: Unvaccinated Wimbledon Champ Novak Djokovic Receives Hero\u2019s Welcome in Serbia", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NBA All-Star Andrew Wiggins Says He Regrets Taking COVID Vaccine Despite Championship Win", "description": "Golden State Warriors all-star Andrew Wiggans says he regrets taking the COVID vaccine ahead of his team's recent championship season", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/nba-all-star-andrew-wiggins-says-he-regrets-taking-covid-vaccine-despite-championship-win/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-07-20T22:05:37+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/901CA916-44D8-43D8-BA10-43DAA66B5680.jpeg", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "968", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["San Francisco", "golden-state-warriors", "Vaccine Mandate", "Andrew Wiggins", "NBA"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM6Xoqkl2h4", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/phil-jackson-slams-the-nba-for-going-woke-says-he-couldnt-watch-social-justice-themed-games/", "https://nationalfile.com/white-woke-evangelicals-triggered-by-tweet/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33746282/brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-reiterates-made-right-decision-not-getting-covid-19-vaccine", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/video-superstar-mlb-catcher-doubles-down-on-vaccination-stance-refuses-to-play-in-canada/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-unvaccinated-wimbledon-champ-novak-djokovic-receives-heros-welcome-in-serbia/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/andrew-wiggins/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/golden-state-warriors/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/nba/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/san-francisco/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-mandate/"], "authors": ["Frankie Stockes"], "publish_date": "2022-07-20T22:05:37+00:00"}
