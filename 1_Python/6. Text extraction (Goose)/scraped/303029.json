Click here to learn why we suggest this.\n\nDr. Peter G\u00f8tzsche is a well known Danish physician with four decades of research experience, publishing 97 papers in the \u201cbig five\u201d (BMJ, Lancet, JAMA, Annals of Internal Medicine, and New England Journal of Medicine) and 19 Cochrane reviews.\n\nHe is a co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, a British international charitable organization formed to organize medical research findings to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions involving health professionals, patients and policy makers.\n\nG\u00f8tzsche, along with medical scientist and investigative journalist Maryanne Demasi, PhD, have published a new paper titled \u201cSerious harms of the COVID-19 Vaccines: A Systematic Review.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a task for academics to look into this phenomenon given the fact that vaccine manufacturers and drug regulators never allowed independent researchers to examine the raw trial data, forcing transparency advocates to sue the FDA for access to the documents.\n\nTo conduct the review, the authors used a number of papers that have been published with data on serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe most important points outlined by the authors are as follows:\n\u2022 None Many of the studies we reviewed were of very poor quality and published in journals that failed to identify fundamental errors.\n\u2022 None The adenovirus vector vaccines increased the risk of venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. (Authorities have responded by suspending the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine across many European countries, and in the US, regulators have advised restricted use of Janssen\u2019s vaccine).\n\u2022 None The mRNA-based vaccines increased the risk of myocarditis, with a mortality of about 1-2 per 200 cases. It was more common in younger males.\n\u2022 None We found evidence of serious neurological harms, including Bell\u2019s Palsy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenic disorder and stroke, which are likely due to an autoimmune reaction from mRNA and adenoviral vector vaccines.\n\u2022 None Severe harms, i.e. those that prevent daily activities, were underreported in the randomized trials.\n\u2022 None Severe harms were very common in studies of fully vaccinated people receiving boosters (3rd dose), and in a study of vaccination of previously infected people (i.e. those with naturally acquired immunity).\n\u2022 None Drug regulators and other authorities have been very slow in following up signals of serious harms.\n\u2022 None Given the difficulties of accessing regulatory data, obfuscations, and documented underreporting, we find it likely that there are other serious harms of the covid-19 vaccines, than those uncovered so far.\n\u2022 None Population-wide recommendations for covid vaccination and boosters ignore the negative benefit to harm balance in low-risk groups such as children and people who have already recovered from covid-19 (natural immunity).\n\nThe authors also point out that, given all the difficulties and obstacles involved with getting access to regulatory data, obfuscations, and documented underreporting, it is likely that there are other serious harms than those uncovered so far.\n\nYou can refer to the study for more details regarding the methods used, and more. It\u2019s just been published, is still in pre-print form, and has yet to go through peer-review.\n\nBelow are some of my most recent articles regarding all things COVID for those who are interested:\n\nA Team of International Scientists & Leading Medical Professionals Are Taking Pfizer To Court In South Africa\n\nNew Analysis Shows How The CDC Spread False Information That Exaggerated The Severity of COVID-19\n\nCirculating Spike Protein Discovered In Blood of Children & Young Adults With Vaccine Induced Myocarditis\n\nAutopsy Results From People Who Died Unexpectedly Within Days of COVID-19 Vaccination", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thepulse.one/p/renowned-medical-researcher-and-colleague", "type": "article", "title": "Renowned Medical Researcher & Colleague Publish Systematic Review of Serious Harms From COVID-19 Vaccines", "description": "The review reveals major errors on the part of regulators, flawed health guidance recommendations, weak vaccine trials, underreporting of injury and a miscalculation of cost-benefit analysis.", "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41de9bb-4dde-4ecf-9260-9eeaf914169e_1020x680.jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41de9bb-4dde-4ecf-9260-9eeaf914169e_1020x680.jpeg", "https://tpulse.substack.com/p/a-new-media-approach-for-improved-sense-making-through-physiological-coherence", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.22283145v2.full-text", "https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o102?ijkey=9a79b58caf29472211bbb9f163d1d74e395279ce&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha", "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/15/which-countries-have-halted-use-of-astrazenecas-covid-vaccine", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-limits-use-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-certain-individuals", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.22283145v2.full-text", "https://www.thepulse.one/p/a-team-of-international-scientists", "https://www.thepulse.one/p/new-analysis-shows-how-the-cdc-spread", "https://www.thepulse.one/p/circulating-spike-protein-discovered", "https://www.thepulse.one/p/autopsy-results-from-people-who-died-unexpectedly-within-days-of-covid-19-vaccination", "https://www.thepulse.one/p/renowned-medical-researcher-and-colleague?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"], "authors": ["Arjun Walia"], "publish_date": "2023-04-04T14:34:20+00:00"}
