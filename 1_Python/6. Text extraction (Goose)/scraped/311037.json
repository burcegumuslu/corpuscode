While many fearful Americans applauded the fact that government can take away your right to freely travel by forcing you to take a vaccine, others made sure to stand up against this massive power grab by the state.Shortly after New York announced their tyrannical order, New Orleans and San Francisco followed suit. Luckily, however, there appears to be a growing resistance and New York is ground zero for it.\n\n\u201cWe followed all rules with the masks and six-foot distancing, curfew, cleaning logs, temperature checks,\u201d Alison Marchese, co-owner of the Italian restaurant Max\u2019s Es-ca on Staten Island, told DailyMail.com. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s enough is enough right now.\u201d\n\nMarchese is part of a group of business owners who have gone on the offensive against the government\u2019s \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cunscientific\u201d vaccine mandate. And unscientific is right as even the CDC has admitted that the vaccines do not prevent transmission or infection.\n\nThe mandates are also incredibly arbitrary as other businesses like grocery stores and hair salons are exempt. Apparently if you get your haircut without the vaccine, you are safe but in a restaurant, you are not safe \u2014 according to government.\n\nIf restaurants and other businesses fail to demand their customers show them their papers, they face thousands of dollars in fines. For a first offense, a business owner will be hit with a $1,000 fine. The fine doubles for a second offense and goes up to $5,000 for a third.\n\nIn the lawsuit, which is Independent Restaurant Owners et al v. Bill de Blasio, the plaintiffs claim that COVID restrictions have \u201cseverely and irreparably damaged\u201d their businesses and others throughout the city, which have been \u201cstruggling to bounce back\u201d since Governor Andrew Cuomo lifted all limits in mid-June.\n\nThe restaurants involved in the lawsuit include Deluca\u2019s Italian Restaurant and Max\u2019s Esca in Staten Island, and Pasticceria Rocco in Brooklyn. The Independent Restaurant Owners Association Rescue and two gyms, Evolve-33 and Staten Island Judo Jujitsu, are also plaintiffs in the complaint.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a court order to block de Blasio\u2019s vaccine mandate, calling the requirement \u201cirrational.\u201d Given the recent data to come out about vaccinated individuals both spreading and contracting COVID-19, the lawsuit called into question the efficacy of vaccines saying it is \u201can uncontested fact that unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals can both contract Covid-19 and the so-called \u2018Delta\u2019 variant, further illustrating the arbitrariness of this executive order.\u201d\n\nNew York City\u2019s mayor is remaining steadfast however, and believes that they will beat any lawsuits like this one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the conversation with the Law Department \u2014 tremendous confidence that we\u2019re in a very strong legal position,\u201d de Blasio said to The NY Times. \u201cWe\u2019re in a global pandemic still. The decisions that have been taken have been taken with the leadership of our health officials who have been fighting this battle from the beginning.\u201d\n\nWhile this group is suing the government, other facets of the resistance against the mandates are simply choosing to disobey. After all, most of the time positive change happens is when good people choose to break bad laws.\n\nPasticceria Rocco\u2019s owner, Mary Josephine Generoso \u2014 who is also part of the lawsuit \u2014 has been outspoken against the mandate and has even put a sign up in front of her business proudly proclaiming that they will not comply and will not discriminate against anyone, vaccinated or not.\n\nAccording to reports on the ground, many businesses have already decided that they will not comply with the mandate and movie theaters, restaurants and other venues have refused to check their customers\u2019 vaccination status before allowing them to enter. There has been no news yet of these businesses refusing to be fined.\n\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.
