J. Grothe | Skeptical Science", "cleaned_text": "Skeptic\u2019s Million Dollar Challenge To Be More Open and Transparent Says JREF President, D.J. Grothe\n\nJoin Skepitko host Alex Tsakiris for a 90-minute interview with journalist, skeptic, and president of the James Randi Educational Foundation, D.J. Grothe. During the interview Grothe discusses the science of skepticism, evidence for survival of consciousness, what constitutes \u201cextraordinary proof\u201d, and changes to the JREF Million Dollar Challenge.\n\n\u201cIf some people conceive of the Million Dollar Challenge as the way science works, in other words, \u2018to advance our scientific understanding in this field, be challenged for a million dollars\u2019\u2026 well, science is not a cage match, despite the fact that you put some big personality scientists in a room and they fight, science doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe Million Dollar Challenge is done in the spirit of science. It\u2019s done looking at the evidence, but it is a vehicle of a non-profit educational foundation to raise public consciousness and awareness about these important questions\u201d, Grothe said.\n\nGrothe also discussed ways to make the challenge of paranormal and supernatural claims more open and transparent, \u201cI\u2019m proud of the transparency so far and we want there to be even more transparency in the following ways. The claimants, when they apply, in short order \u2013 although I\u2019m kind of letting the cat out of the bag \u2013 in the months ahead we want to have a running public display of all the claimants and the progress of their challenges and their applications.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: We\u2019re joined today by someone whose skills as a broadcaster, journalist, and activist I greatly admire. Formerly the host of Point of Inquiry, D.J. Grothe stood toe-to-toe with Nobel Prize winners, leading public intellectuals, and scores and scores of best-selling authors. He not only held his own, but he brought a depth and a command of the topics that was, well, was pretty darned impressive.\n\nNow you notice that I use the word, \u201cformerly\u201d because D.J. has taken a new job. He\u2019s now the President of the James Randi Educational Foundation which many of you know as JREF. It\u2019s in that role that we welcome today D.J. Grothe. Welcome back to Skeptiko.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Well, thank you, Alex. It\u2019s a pleasure to be back on the show. I always enjoy our conversations.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Good. As I just mentioned, D.J., you\u2019re the newly minted President of JREF. Actually, it\u2019s been a couple of months now, but for folks who don\u2019t know too much about JREF, let me read to you the description I got from the JREF Web site. I found it refreshingly straightforward and concise. Here it is\u201d: A non-profit foundation headed by a professional magician. Exposes psychics, faith healers and such.\u201d Perhaps you want to flesh that out a little bit and tell folks what JREF is.\n\nD.J. Grothe: The big answer is it\u2019s an educational non-profit founded by James Randi, who is this public intellectual and magician, as you mentioned. Really, the leading figure in the history of organized skepticism or grass roots skepticism. You know, the people who get their righteous indignation up when there are hucksters or possibly frauds or charlatans out there making claims that aren\u2019t substantiated and that can do harm to believers. Randi started all of this and the James Randi Educational Foundation is his educational non-profit.\n\nOur goal is not just to expose frauds, though. It should be said we\u2019re an educational non-profit committed to advancing critical thinking in general and also specifically about the supernatural, about the paranormal, about pseudo-science claims. It should be said that not all of those claims will involve frauds or charlatans. Sometimes it\u2019s just pseudo-science or self-deceived folks, so I want to offer that clarification.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let me jump right into this because you\u2019re taking over as the President of it and when I heard that, I was \u2013 I guess I was really first quite surprised. I guess I also thought, \u2018Are you up for it?\u2019 Let me ask you that question. Are you up for it? But let me frame that up a little bit and let you know what I mean because certainly you have the intellectual skills; you have the communication skills for the job.\n\nBut I think you\u2019re heading into different waters, you know? In Point of Inquiry, you came at that with an intellectual force and a command of the issues, and also I think an acceptance by your audience that the secular Humanist position was morally and intellectually correct. You used to cover separation of church and state, evolution versus creationism, human rights, and all that kind of stuff.\n\nNow you\u2019re being asked to be the voice of authority on issues of science and issues where the skeptical community in general and in the James Randi Educational Foundation in particular, their position is a little bit murkier in terms of where the public stands and where intellectuals and scientists stand. So in that sense, are you up for being the President of JREF?\n\nD.J. Grothe: That\u2019s a good question, a hard question if I wasn\u2019t up for it. But the good news is I am up for it. More than that, it is form-fitting. If there were a master of the universe to try and create a job that fit D.J. Grothe perfectly, it would be this. Why? Because not only am I a former magician, but I have the same values and the same commitment that James Randi and the Foundation seeks to advance. It\u2019s not so different.\n\nThere are some clarifications and I will offer those, but it\u2019s not so different from the agenda of one of the component organizations of the Center for Inquiry and that CSICOP. I guess now it\u2019s called the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, the skeptical non-profit that is housed at CSI was co-founded by James Randi back in the 70s with folks like Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Paul Kurtz, and others. So I\u2019ve always been motivated by this kind of mission to advance critical thinking about untested claims in an open-minded way.\n\nThere seems to be an implication in your question that JREF \u2013 well, you used the term, \u201cmurky\u201d or something like that, but that JREF may be less than open-minded. I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s my job to make sure that as regards any of these paranormal, pseudo-scientific, supernatural claims, that we approach them in an open-minded and a fair-minded way. That doesn\u2019t mean just because we\u2019re tender-hearted that we\u2019re kind of soft-headed. In other words, we could be rigorous, critical, but do that in a fair-minded way.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think that\u2019s the positive part I saw in terms of you becoming President of JREF. I think you bring that kind of credibility, at least in my mind, in terms of being a consumer of your broadcasts on Point of Inquiry. I found you to be very open-minded and very fair-minded on the issues even though you clearly had a position. You had a point of view.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I appreciate hearing that. Not only do I pride myself, Alex, on my humility \u2013 that\u2019s a joke \u2013 I also pride myself on the qualities that you just mentioned. I consider myself to be an open-minded, fair-minded guy. I should also say that in the history of the James Randi Educational Foundation, we have approached all sorts of un-tested claims, I think, in fair-minded ways.\n\nOf course, because the JREF is doing something no other international non-profit is doing, which is engaging head-on claimants; it\u2019s always going to be a little more controversial than if we were just sitting in our armchairs and spouting off from the Ivory Tower. Instead, we\u2019re rolling up our sleeves. James Randi is really the model here of rolling up his sleeves and getting his hands in the nitty-gritty of these kinds of claims; really testing to see if various claims of supernatural, paranormal, pseudo-scientific claims are real. That\u2019s what I think sets the JREF apart.\n\nSo we\u2019re similar to other national non-profit skeptical organizations in that we care about the same issues. We\u2019re different in that we are engaging some of these things head-on and not just writing our opinions out there. Instead we\u2019re really trying to challenge claimants in the hope of ferreting out the truth, which is something both sides of any of these controversial issues should care about.\n\nThe truth is what should matter. So when we say we will give you one million dollars if you can prove X,Y, or Z, under mutually agreed-upon scientific conditions, I think the claimant should jump at that and know that it\u2019s all done in the spirit of finding out the truth. The truth matters at the JREF. It\u2019s not just a matter of each person having his or her own beliefs and everybody playing nice and going home and not really engaging. We want to engage.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Again, a laudable position, but we have to put it to the test a little bit. We\u2019ll talk about the Million Dollar Challenge in just a minute. Let\u2019s back up because I think before we can get to the Million Dollar Challenge, we have to deal with the science behind these controversial claims that we\u2019re talking about. It sounds like you are willing and ready to engage in a substantive dialogue about the science. I hope that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do and I suspect that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do on your show as well. But are you personally ready to engage in that?\n\nBecause if you are, that\u2019s what Skeptiko deals with every episode. We have the top researchers come on and talk about these things, so are you going to be able to talk about survival of consciousness? Are you going to be able to talk about the best researchers out there, vis-a-vis the skeptical position? Because before we can talk about the prize, which I do want to talk about, we have to talk about the science, don\u2019t we?\n\nD.J. Grothe: Definitely. And the science, or more broadly construed, the evidence is what matters. As you know, from Point of Inquiry which I\u2019m glad to echo your own comment, it was a popular show, garnered a really large audience of people who enjoyed engaging \u2013 call it the cultural competition. It wasn\u2019t just people who believed with a point of view of Point of Inquiry if you were on the show. We had all sorts of folks on and we enjoyed having important dialogues on these issues.\n\nI plan fully for that to continue with JREF\u2019s new show, For Good Reason, which I\u2019ll be hosting. For Good Reason will, I anticipate, have on it all comers \u2013 people who want to discuss the best evidence for the survival of consciousness after death. Well, let\u2019s have that conversation. It is one of the most important conversations we can have.\n\nGhosts. Do they exist? I think that\u2019s not a trivial question; it\u2019s an important conversation. It really touches to the core of so many of the central issues that should get us up in the morning.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I couldn\u2019t agree more, and I think that is really the place where JREF and the skeptical community and the loyal opposition which I consider myself part of, really join forces because we\u2019re all very intensely interested in the questions. Most people go through their day without really giving a lot of thought to these very important, fundamental questions.\n\nD.J. Grothe: We may not agree on the answers. In fact, from conversations I\u2019ve had with you I know that we don\u2019t agree on all the answers. But we agree that the questions are important.\n\nMost believers, if you\u2019ll allow me to paint with a broad brush stoke here \u2013 most believers don\u2019t take the claims even all that seriously. They watch Ghost Hunters or they get their paranormal fix on TV and they just walk around believing.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same thing as a sincere investigator who believes these claims but really earnestly looks at the evidence. That\u2019s the position I think skeptics and believers alike should take. So you\u2019re right, Alex, in that sense \u2013 can I call it the non-skeptical community? That almost sounds like an insult. But the believer community, right?\n\nThe paranormal world and the skeptical world can join in common cause, saying these questions are important. We may disagree on the answers but the questions are important and if we engage the questions sincerely, I think we can all only benefit.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay. Let\u2019s dive in a little bit and you can pull back at any point you want. Let\u2019s talk about survival of consciousness, because as you mentioned, from a scientific standpoint it is at the core of so many of the paranormal and what you would call supernatural experiences that you care about. If you\u2019re talking about psychics; you\u2019re talking about ghosts; if you\u2019re talking about a number of those things, what it really hinges on is, is it possible that our consciousness in whatever way that we might not fully understand; is it possible that consciousness survives death?\n\nD.J. Grothe: Right. When you die are you still alive? That\u2019s the big survival of death question or issue and call it the foundation question of so much else that\u2019s going on in the paranormal.\n\nYou look at the history of parapsychological research, Alex; you look at say J.B. Rhine who at University of Chicago \u2013 your listeners may know J.B. Rhine as really the founder of the whole academic field of parapsychology at Duke University. When he was in Chicago at school, he was a naturalist, not a supernaturalist. He was a Darwinian. He was steeped in the views that said there is no survival of consciousness after death.\n\nAnd let me tell you, that didn\u2019t sit well with him. That mucked with his psychology. You read the documentary evidence and his journals and his writing; you see that this was a formative period where he said, \u201cI want none of that. I really want to apply my scientific life to see if I can\u2019t prove that consciousness can be outside of the body, which then would prove survival of the soul after death.\u201d\n\nHe had an agenda and I don\u2019t fault him for that because I think he actually gets kind of a bad rep from a lot of skeptics as being woo-woo or goofy or not a real scientist. He was a real scientist. It just so happens he was a real scientist with an agenda. You see, though, that that agenda is what fueled his research. He wanted to prove that the soul survives death and from that we got this whole field.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I don\u2019t want to get into the whole history of it, but also he really earned his stripes as a debunker by debunking a very famous psychic of the times. He really was a true researcher.\n\nD.J. Grothe: You\u2019re absolutely right about that. He wasn\u2019t a charlatan himself. He may have had his biases, but Alex, don\u2019t we all have our biases? He did real research that holds up if you look at it. Note that he never said, \u201cMy research proves ESP. My research proves in scientifically verifiable and replicable ways the survival of the soul after death, etc.\u201d I\u2019m just saying his research methods weren\u2019t complete disasters. They had something to commend for them.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And what fascinates me and drives me more is more of the current research. I guess when you talk about survival of consciousness, the first area that I\u2019d go is near-death experience research because it\u2019s the place where we have the most intellectually forceful, scientifically-based, medically-based evidence of survival of consciousness.\n\nNow I assume from where you\u2019re sitting today that you don\u2019t ascribe to that so what skeptical explanation do you give for the near-death experience phenomena? Because we\u2019ve had a bunch of these folks on the show over the last month and we\u2019ve explored just about every skeptical angle I think we can get our hands on. So where are you coming from on the near-death experience phenomena?\n\nD.J. Grothe: Well, I wasn\u2019t on the show to talk about NDEs. I think it\u2019s an important topic so we can touch on it briefly now. If you look at the field of near-death experience research, you see that there are a lot of researchers who believe in the survival of consciousness after death, who disagree both on mechanism, on the process, right? So there are different \u2013 I call it quasi- or pseudo-scientific \u2013 explanations for the survival of consciousness after death.\n\nThere\u2019s debate within the non-skeptical community, in other words, the paranormal community, about how it happens and what exactly is happening. Is it something like astral projection? Is it the little homunculus, the little self that is me that survives death? Is it a more cosmic consciousness that I\u2019m tapping into? There\u2019s debate. I could be more New Age or less New Age; it could sound more scientific or less scientific. But the point is there\u2019s debate.\n\nAs a skeptic, I am not closed-minded. I would love \u2013 in fact, by definition, skeptic at least according to my definition, and I think the working definition of skeptic \u2013 is the opposite of closed-minded. It\u2019s open-minded inquiry. In fact, if you look at the origin of word, skeptical comes from skeptics as you know. It means \u201cjust to inquire\u201d or \u201cto look into.\u201d\n\nSo as a skeptic, I think we should look into these claims, even over and over again, but at some point, say after decades of research into this, if there\u2019s no compelling evidence we can safely conclude it\u2019s time to move on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re at that point yet, but maybe. And I have to concede this point, Alex. Maybe that\u2019s just because I\u2019m kind of young at this. I haven\u2019t spent decades looking at this research. I know other researchers have who have a skeptical view of the claims.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Who would you point to, D.J., and again, I don\u2019t want to monopolize the conversation on this. It\u2019s just something we\u2019ve delved into quite a bit.\n\nDo you like Michael Persinger\u2019s explanation, God Helmet? We\u2019ve had him on the show. Then we had an EEG expert come on who is also a skeptic but kind of totally refuted Persinger\u2019s claim that the only explanation for a near-death experience during a time when someone has a flat EEG is that the brain activity being measured by the EEG isn\u2019t measuring everything that\u2019s going on. Anyway, that\u2019s Persinger\u2019s explanation. It doesn\u2019t stand up.\n\nDo you like Kevin Nelson\u2019s explanation? REM intrusion? We had him on.\n\nDo you like Susan Blackmore\u2019s explanation of the tunnel? We had her on.\n\nMichael Shermer? We haven\u2019t had him on for a long time, but we had him on.\n\nNone of these hold up to any kind of reasonable analysis. We\u2019ve also had the near-death experience proponents on. To me, it\u2019s a clear-cut case of where the skeptical community just isn\u2019t engaging with the data. So all the nice talk we\u2019ve had before about open-minded and seeking the truth is all great. But it only matters when we put it into practice.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I couldn\u2019t agree more. You said a lot there so I\u2019m going to try to grab onto a few of the points. 1) Yes, you have to engage with the claims. You can\u2019t just say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m open-minded,\u201d and then in practice be closed-minded. It\u2019s a no-brainer. You don\u2019t want to act like that. I agree with you there. 2) You mentioned a few kinds of skeptical dismissive approaches or ways of looking at these claims that dismiss them\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And it\u2019s not dismissive. It\u2019s explanations. These are folks that legitimately \u2013 Michael Persinger at Laurentian University, I think is quite an intelligent guy and I enjoyed the dialogue with him. He\u2019s not at all flaky. He\u2019s a hard worker. He publishes like crazy. He just has an explanation for what\u2019s happening during the near-death experience because he realizes it\u2019s a game-changer just like you said there. If there is survival of consciousness we have to look at everything differently.\n\nI\u2019m just offering up that when I talk to skeptics, these are the four people they pull out. Either they say Persinger or they say Kevin Nelson or they say Susan Blackmore, they say Michael Shermer. So I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s the skeptical explanation for near-death experience.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Well, Alex, I\u2019m glad that I misunderstood you and that you weren\u2019t implying these folks were dismissing. Instead, they were offering explanations. That\u2019s really the best thing about science. A number of people can offer explanations that hold water or don\u2019t. You appear to think they don\u2019t hold water. If they don\u2019t hold water, and you and I aren\u2019t on the same page as regards that position \u2013 if they don\u2019t hold water it doesn\u2019t follow that they are not engaging the subject. In fact, by definition, they are engaging the topic, maybe not to your satisfaction.\n\nThe thinking along those lines that let\u2019s say I like most and at this point it\u2019s just a matter of what I like and what I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m not a neuroscientist and I haven\u2019t invested decades of scientific research in this. I\u2019m a \u2013 can I use the phrase, \u201cardent and sincere hobbyist\u201d in a sense like you? You\u2019re a person who\u2019s interested in these topics. You\u2019re up on them. You read them. But you\u2019re not a neuroscientist actively engaged in the field.\n\nThe person I like a lot and her explanations in this regard is Susan Blackmore. That said, I don\u2019t think all of the research has been done on this and I think more research needs to be done. The research I would call for would probably have a different shape and form than the research you would call for.\n\nSo if you\u2019re going to look into the NDE claims, are you going to go to a skeptical or believing neurologist? Or are you going to go to a New Age practitioner who offers past life regression seminars? One problem I see with the paranormal community is that there\u2019s not really a standard by which you judge someone\u2019s authority in a field, or kind of street cred, or bona fides, whatever word you want to use.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Of course there is. Maybe if you paint it in those kind of broad terms you can say anything you want, but when you get down to the particulars it\u2019s the same standard that we all use. It\u2019s are you associated with a major research institution or university? Do you publish in peer-reviewed journals? These are the standards by which everyone is judged, so I don\u2019t know who in particular\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: I love hearing you say something along those lines but you know that you\u2019re jutting up against a whole lot else going on in the paranormal world where you may say, \u201cI\u2019ll only listen to people who are at degree-granting research institutions who are actually doing research.\u201d But a lot of folks who may believe what you\u2019re selling, the NDE idea, will also be listening to folks who from your own vantage, by your own admission just now, have no business speaking out about it or offering explanations or teaching people about it.\n\nSo you might not ever be caught dead at a psychic fair. You might not be caught dead at \u2013 you know, it\u2019s funny. We\u2019re talking about near-death experiences and I\u2019m using the phrase \u201ccaught dead at.\u201d You might not show up at a seminar or astral projection because you, even as a believer in the survival of the soul after death, may rightly think those guys are hucksters. Those folks are charlatans or self-deceived. You surely have to admit that you\u2019re unique in this regard or let\u2019s at least say in the minority among people who believe in this sort of stuff.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re saying because you painted such a mosaic there of different ideas. I think it really gets to the problem that so many people have, so many of the people that I know who are serious about the research have with JREF or have with the skeptical community. And that\u2019s kind of a misunderstanding of what the moral center is.\n\nHere we started off with a discussion on the science of near-death experience and we believe that now because maybe we\u2019ve covered it as we can. But I\u2019d really like to see some skeptical explanation that merits serious consideration for any of these other claims. They don\u2019t stand up.\n\nSo you can paint it and say, \u201cWell, I like Susan Blackmore.\u201d Susan Blackmore\u2019s explanation makes no sense. We could go talk to all the neurologists without asking about near-death experience, but we could ask them about Susan Blackmore\u2019s explanation and they\u2019d tell you it doesn\u2019t make any sense. And I did. And I also did with Kevin Nelson. And I did with Michael Persinger. None of them make any sense. There is no \u201cthere\u201d there in terms of the science for a skeptical explanation of things.\n\nD.J. Grothe: So let me just jump in and talk about this in regard to evidence. You\u2019re suggesting that Susan Blackmore or Persinger or others, and I am partial to Susan Blackmore\u2019s take on this given just where I\u2019m at on the topic. You\u2019ve suggested that they need to proffer a sufficient explanation for near-death experiences or else you\u2019re forced to believe that the near-death experiences are evidence of something supernatural or paranormal or survival of the soul after death, etc. That\u2019s not my take on how science works\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Of course it is. D.J., hold on. When you have someone like Pim von Lommel who does a 10 year retrospective study, publishes it in one of the most highly regarded medical journals in the world, The Lancet, and that\u2019s accepted as research that\u2019s highly suggestive that consciousness survives death, that becomes one brick in the wall that someone is building for this theory. Now as more and more people add more bricks, it becomes the theory that needs to be knocked down by someone else. So we can\u2019t play this game of:\n\n\u201cThe burden of proof is on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the burden of proof is on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the burden of proof is on you.\u201d\n\nAnyone who makes a claim, a skeptical claim for example, Kevin Nelson was on the show a while back, from the University of Kentucky, a very skeptical guy. When he goes out and says that REM intrusion, that process of almost being awake, is an explanation for the near-death experience that is a claim. It\u2019s not a counter-claim that therefore doesn\u2019t require the same level of proof. No, it\u2019s a scientific claim. So if that claim gets shot down, then that advances the claim that it was trying to shoot down. That\u2019s how science works.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I was with you right until the last clause of that sentence. Just because one person advances a view of the solar system that\u2019s not heliocentrism and another person advances another one that\u2019s not heliocentrism, you can shoot one down and it doesn\u2019t mean that both of the remaining views are therefore supported. It only means that the view that\u2019s shot down is not supported. So I was with you right until that last clause.\n\nYou\u2019re right, if a skeptic makes a claim explaining a phenomenon, then it has to be substantiated. If it\u2019s not, it should be dismissed. That\u2019s the glory of science. The best ideas rise to the top.\n\nBut if a skeptical idea can\u2019t stand on its own, it does not follow therefore that the non-skeptical or the paranormal view therefore is substantiated. There\u2019s no connection between those two epistologically. It only means that one set of claims was not substantiated and the other either wasn\u2019t substantiated or hasn\u2019t yet been proven, right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Right, right, I\u2019m with you, except in this case that we\u2019re talking about in particular \u2013 and then we\u2019ll leave near-death experience alone \u2013 in this case, there\u2019s a substantial amount of evidence of the theory that consciousness survives death. You do have to overcome that. At some point it does pile up.\n\nD.J. Grothe: So one last question on this and I know you didn\u2019t have me on the show to talk about it, but I love this topic and I look forward to getting into it much more in my career and in conversations with you and others. I think it\u2019s really, as I mentioned earlier, the foundation question, right? It\u2019s the thing that so many other paranormal claims are wrapped around, and therefore, I want to take it head-on and if there\u2019s evidence that the soul survives death, I want to be the first person to buy into it if it\u2019s real evidence and merits my attention. I would love the hell out of the idea that the soul survives death.\n\nI\u2019m just not going to look to the Bible as evidence or anecdotal experience as evidence as the same kind as the evidence that suggests otherwise coming from the cognitive neurosciences.\n\nSo I want to ask you a pointed question about NDEs. Do you believe \u2013 are you saying, it sounded like you were \u2013 that the scientific evidence \u2013 and you use that word a lot and I like the word \u2013 that the scientific evidence is growing for NDEs or is it overwhelming? Is the case closed? Is it a new science?\n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking is, the evidence we have for survival of the soul after death or even survival of the soul, is it as complete as say, the evidence that we have for evolution? Or the evidence that we have for Newtonian physics, etc.? Or quantum physics if you want to have a conversation with someone else about it? In other words, is the body of knowledge that comprehensive?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think the body of knowledge is quite comprehensive with literally over 100 published research articles that support the idea, are highly suggestive \u2013 the term that scientists like to use \u2013 highly suggestive that consciousness in some way that we don\u2019t completely understand, survives our bodily death.\n\nAnd the best evidence of that is that we have people that are being monitored because they have some kind of medical emergency and we have an EEG hooked up to their head and we have an EKG hooked up to their heart. Maybe they\u2019re even under heavy anesthesia. And then they have these remembrances, these experiences that when they come back, and we have them over and over and over again. We have the medical knowledge to know that they didn\u2019t have any brain function.\n\nAnd we know that those two things \u2013 we don\u2019t know, but the best evidence strongly suggests that those two things are happening together. A flat EEG and some kind of conscious experience that we\u2019re calling near-death experience. Those things are happening at the same time. That\u2019s really the crux of it.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I haven\u2019t followed that evidence. I\u2019m not persuaded by the anecdotes there, but I\u2019m open-minded. You said there\u2019s 100 let\u2019s say, papers. That sounds like a big number. That\u2019s actually a very small number in science. A very small number. But it\u2019s something that should\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, it depends on the field, right? And it depends on the quality of the\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: If it\u2019s a new field and that\u2019s what I was asking at earlier. If it\u2019s a new field, 100 is a good number to suggest further research. But you have to concede then that it\u2019s a new field and that there\u2019s not a body of evidence that is completely nail-in-the-coffin persuasive. It\u2019s a new field and there are questions that merit our attention. At least you seem to be admitting it\u2019s a new field and it\u2019s not conclusive, it\u2019s suggestive for you.\n\nI think scientists should get involved in this if it\u2019s their research field. They should look into the questions more. I think the questions deserve research, but a paranormalist can\u2019t say, \u201cOh, science has proven it,\u201d because I don\u2019t either you or I can say, \u201cFinally. Science has proven the survival of the soul after death.\u201d If that\u2019s your claim, then we have to start our conversation over and go back to basics. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s your claim.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: See, that almost goes into a philosophical discussion. I think we can keep it in real simple terms the way you did earlier in the conversation. It\u2019s about seeking the truth. And if we\u2019re going to be on the edge of seeking the truth, then we have to be comfortable with dealing in these murky waters where things aren\u2019t perfectly clear. I think that\u2019s\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: So true. So true. I could not agree more and this is the distinction between fringe science, some of which I believe in \u2014 I\u2019ll say that as President of the James Randi Educational Foundation \u2013 and pseudo-science which is a different thing entirely. We stand critical of pseudo-science which is kind of fake science, quasi-science that makes claims that aren\u2019t substantiated by science or by the best methods of science or the body of knowledge we call science. It\u2019s not consistent with what we know about the universe. That\u2019s pseudo-science.\n\nFringe science is just new science on the fringes, on the cutting edges. If there are legitimate consciousness studies, scientific research projects by scientists, I think some of those would fall into the fringe category. Some of those may well fall into the pseudo-science category. This is equally true about some of the new science coming out that might be broadly construed as trans-Humanism or some of the radical life extension work of folks like Aubrey DeGrey and others. I would consider him a fringe scientist or kind of on the cutting edge, not a pseudo-scientist, but my gosh, there are skeptics who say, \u201cHow dare you even read one of his books and be excited about the prospect because he is not consensus science.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m generally persuaded by consensus in the sciences, understanding that consensus should be overturned by new evidence. That\u2019s the whole way science progresses. You touched on that earlier. But I\u2019m not automatically opposed to science on the cutting edge or science on the fringes.\n\nIf all you\u2019re suggesting, Alex, is this uncontroversial claim that some research in consciousness studies or the survival of the soul after death is on the fringes of science, then I can\u2019t disagree with you on that point.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, let\u2019s back up then because you mentioned a word that really stirs me in a way, and that\u2019s this claim of pseudo-science, because so many times I\u2019ve encountered skeptics who haul that out as some label, some magic wand that they can automatically wave across some idea that they don\u2019t like and it will therefore go away. Let\u2019s take people\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: Uh-huh (yes). I don\u2019t like that, either. That\u2019s kind of an epithet, an insult some skeptics give to ideas that don\u2019t work for them. It just sounds very post-modern and certainly not post-modernist in regards to claims of knowledge. But you don\u2019t deny that there is such a thing as pseudo-science.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: By definition there is, but I want to direct the conversation over to one of the folks who I think we would probably agree is one of the more prominent skeptical researchers. He\u2019s a guy who makes the circuit on your conferences and on very popular \u2013 especially in the UK \u2013 and that\u2019s Dr. Richard Wiseman, who of course you\u2019re familiar with.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I love Richard and I want to remind myself that I wasn\u2019t on the show to give reports on my views on various researchers or thinkers. I\u2019m fine to have those conversations, but I also\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019m not trying to put you on the spot on any particular position he\u2019s taken, but on the broader position because I think it gets to the intellectual core or lack thereof of the skeptical position. Here\u2019s the quote from Richard Wiseman, and if you don\u2019t want to respond to this, you don\u2019t have to. I think you\u2019ll have an opinion on this. I think you will. This was in the UK\u2019s Daily Mail. He said: \u201cI agree that by the standards of any other area of science that remote viewing is proven. But that begs the question, do we need higher standards of evidence when we study the paranormal?\u201d\n\nNow, in a later interview clarifying that on September 28, 2009, here was his clarification: \u201cIt was a slight misquote because I was using the term in a more general sense of ESP. That is, I wasn\u2019t just talking about remote viewing per se, but rather Ganzfeld, etc. I think that they do meet the usual standards for a normal claim, but are not convincing enough for an extraordinary claim.\u201d\n\nSo the question for you is what business are you in? Are you in the business of extraordinary claim business? Or are you in the business of \u201cwhere is the science really going?\u201d And in that sense, where is the intellectual force behind JREF? Behind the skeptical community? Because if it is the Better Business Bureau for psychics and fraudulent claims, then that\u2019s great. If you want to just go find the psychics who are really ripping people off or the past life regression people who are ripping people off and that\u2019s where you\u2019re at, then that\u2019s great.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to continue to make basically what are scientific position statements in saying that we don\u2019t believe there is any \u201cthere\u201d there when it comes to these claims, well then, I think you\u2019re undermined by some of the very people that you point to as being the luminaries, like Richard Wiseman who says, hey, this stuff is basically already been proven.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Well, to be clear on Wiseman\u2019s quote, first of all, in its entirety and with his clarification, I agree. That said, let me tell you how I agree. There is in the history of parapsychological research some lines of evidence to suggest there\u2019s something going on there.\n\nYou mentioned Ganzfeld. There might be a couple others. The expert here is Ray Hyman, a statistician, a friend, maybe this is a mischaracterization, but from my vantage he\u2019s a friend of the parapsychology set even as he\u2019s a skeptic because he\u2019s so damned fair-minded and he\u2019s corrected the skeptical community a number of times when they\u2019ve I think wrongly\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s not been my experience, but go ahead. We\u2019re familiar with Ray Hyman and we\u2019ve delved into his work a little bit. He\u2019s never agreed to come on and face Dean Radin or face any of the folks who don\u2019t feel the way that you do. Go ahead. Let\u2019s take him on.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I think some of that has to do with that he\u2019s pretty media-savvy and doesn\u2019t want to \u2013 well, we don\u2019t have to guess at people\u2019s motivations but I will. How do you like that? I think Hyman just doesn\u2019t want to engage certain kinds of claimants and he\u2019s much more interested in a sub-set of parapsychologists who without wanting publicity and without trying to sell their books or any of that stuff, they\u2019re just quietly doing their research. He\u2019s done some of the big studies in a big way of a number of these parapsychology research projects.\n\nThe reason I brought him up was that he suggests to me the right approach of the skeptical community, which is to not in a knee-jerk way dismiss every project of research in parapsychology. There are skeptics \u2013 you may know of some \u2013 who would. Who would say, \u201cOh my God, we know there\u2019s no such thing as ghosts so there\u2019s no reason to go investigating it. We know there\u2019s no such thing as psychics. So there\u2019s no reason to have that research project.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s the wrong approach. In fact, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s skeptical at all. I think that\u2019s kind of cynical, kind of knee-jerk, you know? I call these folks knee-jerks, right? Because it\u2019s kind of a jerky way that they automatically assume there\u2019s not going to be any reason to do that research.\n\nWhat Wiseman was getting at, or what I guess he was getting at, I haven\u2019t spoken with him about this quote that you pulled out of a paper and asked me about, is that psychic claims, ESP claims, are not run-of-the-mill claims. They\u2019re not the kinds of claims that you have low standards of evidence like you would in any research paper where you just want something to suggest this or that. As you were talking about earlier, no NDE researcher had said, \u201cAha! I published a paper that conclusively proves the survival of the soul after death.\u201d They couch their terms as scientists do in more tentative language and they say this suggests this possibility. Here\u2019s a reason for further research, etc.\n\nWhen you\u2019re dealing with extraordinary claims I think you want to be extra-special, rigorous, in your research. You want to have even higher standards of evidence because of the implications of wide-spread credibility in that claim. So an example here is the Wakefield Study on Vaccines, published a number of years ago in The Lancet. You mentioned The Lancet earlier.\n\nIt took The Lancet all these years \u2013 they just retracted that paper a couple days ago \u2014 the autism paper that really set off this frenzied movement of activists who mean well but don\u2019t do well, who believe that vaccines have some relationship to autism. You have the Jenny McArthur set \u2013 or Jenny McCarthy, I guess. I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s a little McArthur in some ways, as well.\n\nD.J. Grothe: So she and her ilk are fueled by this seemingly legitimate research paper published in The Lancet that The Lancet finally retracted because they said, \u201cOh, shoddy evidence. We were wrong to publish it. Didn\u2019t belong in our journal.\u201d It should have high standards of evidence for kinds of claims that, if widely believed in, would or could negatively impact folks.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay, now D.J., hold on. You\u2019ve done a better job of defending Wiseman\u2019s quote than anyone I\u2019ve heard, so I have to give you kudos for that. First, let me back up and fill in a little bit on the Ray Hyman thing. First of all, Ray Hyman\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ray Hyman. I love him, but I didn\u2019t come on this show to debate about him. Go on.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You\u2019re not, but you just said some things about Ray Hyman and I just need to say these and then we\u2019ll just move on real quickly. I\u2019ll give you the background. Ray Hyman was on a skeptical show \u2013 you know it \u2013 Skeptic\u2019s Guide to the Universe, specifically talking about some research. We really dug into that research. We had the researcher, Dean Radin, come on and show how Hyman was directly contradicted by the published research. Really there isn\u2019t any question about that. Steve Novella invited Ray Hyman on. I invited Ray Hyman on. Won\u2019t come on to\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: Just to interject and we can move on, one reason that scientists might not go on is because podcasts aren\u2019t generally the medium to correct a scientist\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But he was on a podcast. He made his claim on a podcast. He made his claim on a skeptical podcast. They all sat around and chuckled, and he made some really disparaging comments about Dean Radin\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You just said before so let me tell you from my perspective in talking to a lot of parapsychology researchers, Hyman is not held in the kind of high esteem that you alluded to at all. So that\u2019s my position on it. He needs to answer up to the claims that he made that don\u2019t seem to hold water and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\n\nBut there\u2019s no need to monopolize the conversation on a guy who isn\u2019t here. But I\u2019d be happy to have him on here.\n\nOn the Wiseman thing, I have to say, you did a very good job of defending it. But I think the counter to that is that the whole purpose of science is to remove us from our subjectivity, to remove us from our biases. We don\u2019t want to introduce biases back in. We don\u2019t want to say subjectively what is an extraordinary claim, subjectively what is extraordinary proof.\n\nThat\u2019s why we set up peer review; that\u2019s why we set up journals, so they can decide that. The proper mechanism is just exactly what you describe. The Lancet publishes; The Lancet retracts. It\u2019s not appropriate for Wiseman to suggest that there is this other standard that\u2019s beyond science that is extraordinary. Now, I understand where he\u2019s coming from\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: You\u2019re actually bringing up a big debate in the philosophy of science. Not the kind of debate that scientists who publish research papers have, but the debate that philosophers of science have when they say, \u201cIs science, cross-science enough? Is it enough to just do our research without thinking of the implications of it?\u201d That\u2019s a big ethical debate.\n\nI think when you\u2019re dealing with doing research that deals with these big questions, I think there\u2019s a responsibility there to make damn well sure you\u2019re on the right track and not let your own biases \u2013 you\u2019re talking about removing the biases \u2013 but not let your own biases like fear of death or desire to connect with deceased loved ones or any of that, let you play a little fast and loose with the evidence.\n\nEspecially when the implications of such wide spread belief, in my view \u2013 I know you don\u2019t share this \u2013 are harmful to the mass of people \u2013we\u2019re removed from the science right now, you understand \u2014 to the extent that you believe that hook, line and sinker, I think your life is diminished. That\u2019s a hard claim. And that\u2019s worth another debate.\n\nSo if you\u2019re going to publish in a scientific paper because the ancient religious text, they\u2019ve kind of lost their luster and there\u2019s nothing groovier for someone than to say, \u201cAha! Science says the soul survives death.\u201d Because when religion says it, it no longer matters because no one really buys religion or at least a certain segment of our population would rather get it from science than from religion.\n\nWell, if you\u2019re going to use the authority of \u201cscience\u201d to support the claim that we have a soul and that it survives death, you\u2019ve got to be damn well sure that you\u2019re doing the best research. So I\u2019m all for higher standards of evidence because when you jump through those hoops, mister, you change my mind. Then I\u2019m a person who\u2019s going around preaching survival of the soul after death.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: See, I was right with you there, cheering you on, until the end and then I think you proved my point. When you venture into that realm of embracing the subjective measure of what\u2019s culturally appropriate for extraordinary, then I think you\u2019ve lost your way. That\u2019s where I think we have to hold onto science and value science so dearly because it strips that away and says, no, we just want the data in the best form that we can get it, in its clearest path towards nudging a little bit closer to this truth.\n\nIf as we\u2019re getting closer it just gets further away, well, then, we have to embrace that, too, right? Because all this research might just reveal greater and greater mystery, not less mystery. And we have to embrace that as part of the process, too.\n\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m against this idea that we need to layer on top of the scientific method and the scientific institution that we have for finding the truth. We have to layer on top of that something subjective called \u201cextraordinary claim and extraordinary proof.\u201d It just gets into this silly debate.\n\n\u201cNo, what you\u2019re saying is extraordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, what you\u2019re saying is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nAnd we lose everything.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I\u2019m all for evidence changing minds. That\u2019s the good part of science. That\u2019s something I celebrate in science. You don\u2019t get that a whole lot in other ways of looking at the world. But are you suggesting that the very best evidence is really pointing to the existence of the soul and the survival of the soul after death? And if you\u2019re suggesting that \u2013 and I think that\u2019s an audacious claim, Alex \u2013 but prove it to me, if not now, off the air or something.\n\nIf you\u2019re suggesting that, then why the heck hasn\u2019t there just been a whole world-view shift among all scientists in this field? Or would you just chalk that up to how they\u2019ve biased themselves and they\u2019re closed-minded to this plain-as-day research that\u2019s so conclusive? What I\u2019m asking is, is it conclusive or is it merely suggestive? There\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s suggestive that is not borne out by further research.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think it\u2019s highly, highly suggestive and for me personally, it\u2019s convincing. It\u2019s to the point where it is convincing that that is a reality.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Now, to your second point\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: Explain to me the phrase, \u201cto me personally it\u2019s convincing.\u201d Why is it convincing to you and not to other people? Does that have to do with your background, your own motivations, your own desires? Or does it have to do with that you\u2019re just better at looking at the evidence than the other scientists?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, I was really speaking of it in terms of the only way the we can. I mean, you were talking about how scientists like to couch things in careful terms and say \u201chighly suggestive,\u201d and \u201cprobabilistic,\u201d and all that.\n\nBut then at the end of the day, when each of us put our head on the pillow, we have our beliefs and hopefully for many of us who are skeptical by nature, those beliefs are in flux. So they change. We can look at points in our lives when we believed or were convinced of one thing and then we were changed and we\u2019re convinced of something else. I\u2019m talking about that more as an internal, weighing of the evidence. I am convinced of survival of consciousness by the evidence because that\u2019s what drives me. That\u2019s what convinces me.\n\nD.J. Grothe: But wait. Weren\u2019t you convinced before you looked at the evidence? Or were you like a skeptic of the survival of soul after death until you read these research papers?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I was unconvinced. I was very unconvinced, yes.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Well, if that\u2019s true, and I have no reason to doubt that it\u2019s true, that\u2019s at least a point in your favor. I\u2019ll give you that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: To your other point and then I do want to talk about the Million Dollar Challenge before our time runs out. I appreciate you engaging this dialogue. It\u2019s everything that I could have hoped and it\u2019s really kudos to you because I have to tell you, as I try and engage folks who claim to be in the skeptical community, very few of them are really willing to engage in these questions. I don\u2019t think these are tough questions. I think these are core questions. I like the way that we are able to engage in it. I wish there was more of this kind of dialogue out there, not only between you and I but between so many proponents, believers and skeptics.\n\nHaving said that little stump speech, let me get back to your other point in terms of why am I convinced and others are not convinced? Now, of course I can\u2019t answer that completely but I did get some interesting insights into that just by doing this Skeptiko show and interviewing so many of these really smart people.\n\nMichael Persinger, who is just lauded by so many skeptics because they really haven\u2019t delved into his research very much and just know this God Helmet thing, say, \u201cOh, the God Helmet, yeah, there it is. God Helmet, God Helmet.\u201d Talk to Michael Persinger and you\u2019ll see that in his lab he believes that he\u2019s demonstrated telepathy. So he hooks two people up to the God Helmet and he sends a light flash at one and it appears in the EEG pattern of the person in the other room. He\u2019s repeated it. So there he is saying, \u201cYeah, telepathy. Anomalous communication. Yeah, I\u2019ve proven it.\u201d\n\nAnyway, you talk to someone like that and then you get to their explanation for near-death experience, and as brilliant as this guy is, and as so much smarter he is than I, his explanation doesn\u2019t hold water. It only takes me a couple of phone calls to EEG experts.\n\nOne I found is a very skeptical guy, as well. It\u2019s such a paradox. So the guy I find to respond to Persinger\u2019s comment that the EEG is only measuring the surface of the brain and that\u2019s why near-death experiencers with a flat EEG, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s really deep in the brain. It took me, like I say, a couple of phone calls. I found a guy who\u2019s one of the leading EEG experts in the country and like I say, is skeptical of near-death experience and he says, \u201cWell, no, that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not how EEG works, and there\u2019s numerous studies both in animals and people that would refute that.\u201d But the EEG expert, he doesn\u2019t know the rest of the research.\n\nSo to answer your question, I\u2019ll try to be more concise here. Folks just haven\u2019t engaged in the data. If you engage in the near-death experience data and you\u2019re really open-minded about it, you can really only come to one conclusion.\n\nD.J. Grothe: So we\u2019re in a sense back to square one where you\u2019re chasing around certain claims and certain explanations and you\u2019re telling me why you refute some, accept others. You remind me of the founder of -can I call it \u201cthe cult\u201d-that I was in as a young teenager. Because you said, \u201cLook, all these skeptics, they\u2019ve not looked at the evidence.\u201d And some of these even believers, when they disagree, they haven\u2019t looked at all the evidence. But Alex, you alone have looked at all the evidence or maybe not uniquely\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But D.J., that\u2019s not at all what I said. I don\u2019t know how else you could do it, D.J. What I\u2019ve done and what I\u2019ve tried to present on Skeptiko is just looking at the best evidence on both sides of the issue. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve had a lot of proponents of near-death experience who are solid researchers on the show. I just had Dr. Jeffrey Long, who\u2019s published the most comprehensive near-death experience research ever. Ten years to compile.\n\nI had Dr. Peter Fenwick from the UK on. I had Dr. Penny Sartori on. But here\u2019s my point to respond to what you\u2019re saying. These people don\u2019t disagree with me. They say, \u201cYeah.\u201d They\u2019re agreeing. They\u2019re saying, \u201cYeah, when anyone looks at all the evidence, this is the conclusion we\u2019re coming to.\u201d So this isn\u2019t my unique position.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Well, they disagree with one another about mechanism and process and\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Who disagrees on those things? Who disagrees?\n\nD.J. Grothe: And moreover \u2014 I\u2019ll just finish the thought \u2013 you also disagree with all of the skeptics you say you, unlike all the skeptics, you\u2019ve looked at all the evidence and the skeptics just have not. So they find Persinger\u2019s explanation just too convenient.\n\nThey pull it out of their hat and they say, \u201cAh, magnets and part of the brain, whatever. There. That\u2019s the explanation and I\u2019m sticking to it.\u201d\n\nAnd you say, \u201cNo, no.\u201d Alex, unique among all those folks, you\u2019ve taken the\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Not unique. Not unique, D.J. I never claimed to be unique. My\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: Well, you were contrasting yourself to all those skeptics. That\u2019s my point. If someone wants to know the answer to the question I asked you, which was, \u201cWhy do you believe it but science doesn\u2019t?\u201d Or science in general except for whom I think you would admit would be a fringe group, not a \u2013 if you don\u2019t want to use the word pseudo-scientific group \u2013 but they\u2019re on the cutting edge of science, you might say, of believers in NDEs and the survival of the soul after death, well, they\u2019re in the minority.\n\nSo the majority of scientists who look into those questions don\u2019t believe as you, and your explanation is that they haven\u2019t looked at the evidence but you have. In my cheeky way, that was the comparison I was making with the founder of my beloved cult.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: We would have to unpack that and take another 15 minutes to do it, which I don\u2019t think is worthwhile, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re characterizing it correctly. We\u2019ll see. You can follow-up with me and tell me how you think. And I\u2019m happy to cooperate with you either on this show or on your new show, For Good Reason, and\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026and explain to me how you would go about seeking the truth, which you\u2019ve stated was your goal. I don\u2019t see any other way to do it. You look at folks who have published peer-reviewed articles on this topic and you sort through them as best you can, finding the best experts to comment on those. That\u2019s the way that it\u2019s done. So I don\u2019t think my methodology is different than how you would do it. It\u2019s the only way to do it. How else would you do it?\n\nD.J. Grothe: But you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s different than how all the skeptics that you mentioned do it. You\u2019re suggesting that none of them have looked at the evidence like you have, and I thought that took a little chutzpah and I was just responding to it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: If you, D.J., or anyone who listens to Skeptiko, what you\u2019ll hear is not my pronouncements on these but directly reaching the researchers. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do, is this thread of dialogues. So when Kevin Nelson claims REM intrusion explains near-death experience, I don\u2019t refute his claims. I call on another expert in the field like Dr. Jeffrey Long, to say, \u201cYeah, I know the guy well. I recruited the subjects for his experiment, actually. And if you look at the data, you\u2019ll find that 40 percent of the people going in didn\u2019t even have REM intrusion.\u201d So you have a point-by-point reputation of his claim.\n\nThen I said separately from that, D.J., if I listen\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: Yeah, I know nothing about REM intrusion. I\u2019m not familiar with that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019m saying I, as an individual, listen to those two arguments and make my judgment and say, \u201cGee, this guy\u2019s explanation makes more sense to me and that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going.\u201d I think that\u2019s how everyone does it. I don\u2019t find anything particularly cultish about that. To me, that\u2019s reasoned, critical thinking on these issues.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Boy oh boy, I have to clarify something because otherwise it would be a sandstorm. 1) Easy to clarify, you are saying that\u2019s not how everyone does it. You\u2019re saying that\u2019s not how the skeptics do it. You\u2019re saying you look at all the evidence and the skeptics don\u2019t\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, I\u2019m saying that\u2019s how anyone who really engages in critical thinking does it.\n\nD.J. Grothe: \u2026and by implication you\u2019re saying all those skeptics you mentioned aren\u2019t engaging in critical thinking. I was kind of challenging that with you because it\u2019s a cheeky \u2013 it takes some balls to say, \u201cI, unlike all these other researchers, I\u2019m looking at the evidence and they\u2019re not.\u201d Okay, that\u2019s point one.\n\n2) About the cult comment, in no sense was I saying you are cultic or like you\u2019re in a cult. So don\u2019t walk away from our conversation saying, \u201cMy God, D.J. said I was like a cult leader.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, I heard what you said and I just don\u2019t think it really stands up. Let\u2019s move on because we\u2019ve really gone for a long time here and I do want to talk about the Million Dollar Challenge. I want to hear where you\u2019re going with it and where you plan on taking it. I heard on another show, and I think it was on Steve Novella\u2019s show that you mentioned it is more of a rhetorical prize than a real prize. I want to make sure that you understand the criticisms of the Million Dollar Challenge.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Before you get to those, I just want to address what you just said. I don\u2019t want to let that stand. There is a rhetorical aspect of that, but rhetorical in the sense that it is for public speech. Not rhetorical in the sense that oftentimes in common usage you say, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t really mean that. That was rhetorical.\u201d I don\u2019t mean rhetorical in that sense.\n\nRhetoric, which is public persuasion? That\u2019s in the sense that the Million Dollar Challenge is a PR vehicle to raise consciousness or awareness of the public about their responsibility to take these claims seriously enough to look at the evidence and not buy them hook, line, and sinker without looking at the evidence.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s a chief means for us to challenge irresponsible claimants. That hopefully fleshes out what you heard on Novella\u2019s show. The Million Dollar Challenge is real. There\u2019s a million dollars for the asking if anyone can show evidence of their claims, supernatural, paranormal, parapsychological, the kinds of claims that we would challenge as skeptics.\n\nIf you can prove us wrong, the million is yours. It\u2019s a real million. It\u2019s not just a PR vehicle. Of course, I fully acknowledge that as an educational non-profit, we are using the Million Dollar Challenge as a way to get public attention on these matters or to do public relations about these matters. As such, it\u2019s really the chief means that we do that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: This isn\u2019t like the X Prize or anything. This isn\u2019t going to send rockets into space or build more fuel efficient cars. The problem is, it isn\u2019t intended to advance anything. It\u2019s just intended to draw attention to your scientific position, which in and of itself, I think is problematic. Why do we need a position? We\u2019ve just had this very interesting, engaging dialogue for an hour on real science. I can\u2019t imagine in the way that the JREF Million Dollar Challenge has been used, that that Million Dollar Challenge would ever come into play on any of the topics we\u2019ve talked about.\n\nWe just mentioned Michael Persinger, him thinking that in his laboratory he has proven telepathy. I can\u2019t ever imagine him approaching JREF on a scientific basis and saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve established this. Go ahead. Let\u2019s set up the terms for my challenge.\u201d\n\nD.J. Grothe: If he doesn\u2019t, I wonder why he doesn\u2019t. Persinger has some interesting things to say. And if he thinks\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Because there isn\u2019t scientific legitimacy to the JREF Million Dollar Challenge. I\u2019ve talked to all these guys. None of them think it\u2019s legitimate. Maybe you can change that. Maybe as the new President and with your openness and your integrity, maybe you can usher in a new era where it does become something like the X Prize. But right now\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: I think you have a good understanding of where we\u2019ve gone with it and where we want to go with it. I want to flesh that out a bit. 1) You\u2019re right. It is not how science gets done. The Million Dollar Challenge is a million dollar prize or offer that the JREF makes available to claimants, most of whom aren\u2019t scientists or approaching this in the spirit of science.\n\nThey\u2019re paranormal or psychic or some other kind of claimant \u2014 a housewife, who thinks she has the ability to dowse and she got some media attention or something and she\u2019s making a buck on it. We say, \u201cProve it. If you do, you get our million.\u201d If she says, \u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t want the million,\u201d then we have to question motives or be suspicious there. If everything\u2019s on the table we say, \u201cNo, it will be by mutually agreed upon scientific conditions that we can test these sorts of claims.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re right that a scientist in a lab looking at some of these questions may, for over-determined reasons, not approach the JREF for that million dollars; one of which is that\u2019s not generally how science is done. You don\u2019t try to prove a scientific claim in order to get a million dollars. You publish something in a peer-reviewed journal. That\u2019s how science is done.\n\n2) Another reason is that the standards of evidence are actually lower in some of the sciences, like Richard Wiseman mentioned in that quote, than they would be for the million dollars. If we\u2019re going to give away a million dollars, man, although some skeptics may disagree with me on this, I would love to award the million dollars to someone.\n\nI think it would be a great day for science if someone proved conclusively some paranormal or psychic claim. Not only would the million dollars be well-spent, but it would change the world as we know it. It would change physics. There would be a Nobel Prize awarded for it.\n\nIf a person passed the preliminary tests, many of which you have tens of thousands of dollars as awards or prizes \u2013 and then passed the Million Dollar Challenge, man, it would change everything. I\u2019d love for the JREF to be a part of that.\n\nIt just so happens after decades of looking into this sort of stuff as individual researchers and then the last 13 years of the James Randi Educational Foundation, we have not found any evidence to support the claims. In fact, the vast majority \u2013 I hope this changes, and this is one of the things we want to change \u2013 but heretofore, the vast majority of people who have tried out for the Million Dollar Challenge just have not even really gotten past phase one, so to speak. They haven\u2019t shown really any reason to advance and often by their own admission. They say, \u201cOh well, I just had a bad day. I know I got that completely wrong.\u201d They move on with their lives.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: D.J., I think if you can raise the Million Dollar Challenge to the level that you\u2019re talking about and bring transparency and openness in the way that you\u2019re talking about it, I think you will have done a great service to the skeptical community in general. You might even turn this thing into a valuable tool. I think when you get to that point, it\u2019ll be really interesting to see what happens, because that\u2019s the other criticism.\n\nMy criticism of it is that it isn\u2019t really scientific and it\u2019s sometimes used by skeptics in an inappropriate way to claim that scientists who are making claims that seem to refute some of the skeptical positions, that they\u2019re not to be believed because they haven\u2019t stepped forward for the Million Dollar Challenge. I think the way you framed it up, I think it is very true and very accurate and it\u2019s a useful tool and you\u2019re the guy to do it.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Let me just rejoin to this. The criticism you just offered of the Million Dollar Challenge is legit. If some people conceive of the Million Dollar Challenge as the way science works, in other words, to advance our scientific understanding in this field, be challenged for a million dollars. Science is not a cage match, despite the fact that you put some big personality scientists in a room and they fight, science doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe Million Dollar Challenge is done in the spirit of science. It\u2019s done looking at the evidence but it is a vehicle of a non-profit educational foundation to raise public consciousness and awareness about these important questions. Leading scientists who are skeptics, kind of on our side of the fence, Ray Hyman is one of them, shares those exact criticisms of the Million Dollar Challenge.\n\nI think they\u2019re legit but I\u2019m unapologetic about that. We\u2019re not a scientific body. We don\u2019t have teams of scientists in the employ of the JREF. We\u2019re a non-profit educational foundation that cares about advancing critical thinking in society. We just so happen to put a million of our dollars on the table to anyone who can prove under mutually agreed-upon scientific conditions, his or her supernatural or paranormal claim.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What about openness and transparency? Tell us. That\u2019s another criticism that been levied that you can address. Is that something you will address?\n\nD.J. Grothe: I\u2019m proud of the transparency so far and we want there to be even more transparency in the following ways. The claimants, when they apply, in short order \u2013 although I\u2019m kind of letting the cat out of the bag \u2013 in the months ahead we want to have a running public display of all the claimants and the progress of their challenges and their applications. We want to automate the application process because we just aren\u2019t following the very basic guidelines of the application process. So we\u2019re going to have, hopefully, more automation in the application process.\n\nIf you think you have a talent, ability, a supernatural power; if you think your little gizmo magnetically ages wine to make it indistinguishable from a 40 year old merlot or you think that you have an electronic gadget that increases your ESP; whatever the claim, the supernatural or paranormal claim, you fill out the application and begin the process to go after this million dollars. We think it\u2019s going to be an even better tool than it\u2019s been in the past to get the best claimants out there and going for the million dollars.\n\nIf you also notice that we look around and challenge certain claimants in our society with the million dollars, I think that will be an important new direction as well. One example here, Alex, just off the top of my head, is there are a number of nursing colleges in the United States that I think most skeptics would be appalled at finding out and many fair-minded people who might not self-identify as skeptics would be appalled to find out they teach as part of their medical curricula what\u2019s called \u201chealing touch.\u201d\n\nD.J. Grothe: Therapeutic touch. Nurses to go into the patient\u2019s bedside and gingerly\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s been investigated with science, not with the Million Dollar Challenge. Again, I\u2019m with you 100 percent; I think moving things in the direction of openness does\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: It needs to be investigated with science, you\u2019re right. I think there hasn\u2019t been enough investigation to merit being so widely applied. I think it\u2019s just a popular thing\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: \u2026but I\u2019ll just finish this one point. If a claimant says, \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing has more than palliative effect, what supernatural medical intervention I\u2019m doing can help heal you.\u201d I love the idea of calling some of these people who are making a big buck on these sorts of claims, calling them out. Or a nationally prominent psychic who\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: D.J., call out the nationally \u2013 hold on. You\u2019ve got to be able to separate this out. Again, I\u2019m with you. I love everything you\u2019re saying up until you get to a point. I mean, the nationally prominent psychic, yeah, draw them out. The televangelist, draw them out. You\u2019ll never get them to agree to it, but that\u2019s fine.\n\nBut when you start talking about therapeutic touch, hey\u2026 is its real? The only way you\u2019re ever going to know is through some study done over years, hundreds of patients, multiple kinds of controls\u2026 to diminish the scientific question down to this gag gift of scientific prizes. I think it\u2019s a detriment to a science. I think you have to be really careful how you use that tool. Why not just do what you said\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: You\u2019re absolutely right that the way to really ferret out the truth about therapeutic touch is years if not decades of research. I don\u2019t think that research has been done, yet it\u2019s being proffered at all of these nursing colleges.\n\nSo a way for us as an educational non-profit in the public\u2019s interest to raise awareness about this, is maybe to challenge practitioners who are making money on something that science says is as of yet untested. Now, you\u2019re right. They will likely say, \u201cOh, leave me alone. My life was fine until you started bothering me. I\u2019m a nice nurse. Or a nice dean of a nursing college.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But that\u2019s not the point. The point is that as you just admitted, the vehicle that you have isn\u2019t the right vehicle to establish whether Jane Doe, therapeutic touch practitioner, is efficacious in what she does. So you\u2019re not\u2026\n\nD.J. Grothe: It\u2019s a great vehicle to raise the public\u2019s awareness about these questions and so\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But not if it\u2019s not fair in seeking the truth, which goes back to an hour ago, what we said you\u2019re all about. If you\u2019re really all about seeking the truth then you have to hold to that and not be tempted to be using some kind of trick or stunt that might draw attention but doesn\u2019t really nudge us closer to the truth.\n\nLook, do what you just said for the Million Dollar Challenge and it\u2019ll be a huge step forward. You\u2019ll have hundreds of applicants. They\u2019ll be online for everyone to review. People will be able to see how they go through the process, whether they\u2019re treated fairly. That\u2019s all you need to do. You don\u2019t need to go call anybody out. That\u2019s the problem with the Pigasus Award and how it\u2019s been so misused. Why would we call out scientists?\n\nD.J. Grothe: The Pigasus is a kind of funny way that the JREF has historically highlighted some nonsense.\n\nBut you\u2019re right. The Million Dollar Challenge is not going to be the only way that new research is advanced in some of these fields. In fact, the Million Dollar Challenge does not fuel new research. What it does is challenge existing claims. So if someone is making an unsubstantiated claim, I think they\u2019re fair game. In the end, that engagement actually advances the truth-seeking we\u2019re all talking about because we\u2019re able to engage on those claims rather than just ignoring it or saying, \u201cWell, hopefully science will get around to it at some point and look into these claims.\u201d\n\nSo with therapeutic touch as the example, I think the Million Dollar Challenge could in fact hasten science as the big institution it is, into substantiating or otherwise evaluating therapeutic touch claims. And if they can\u2019t be substantiated, there\u2019s no reason in the world that such services should be offered and even paid for by some insurance companies in nursing colleges across the United States.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Complicated issue. It\u2019s where we really differ in terms of what really, truly advances science and science education.\n\nAnd as a final thought because it was brought up, you know the problem with the Pigasus Award is, we don\u2019t need to be calling out and ridiculing scientists because we don\u2019t agree with their ideas. If you find methods that are in error or something like that \u2013 the one that we\u2019ve dug into the furthest was the Pigasus Award was given to Rupert Sheldrake. He\u2019s kind of a friend of the show. He\u2019s been on many times on Skeptiko.\n\nYou know, just independently, I had a student at the University of London who did a dissertation. I didn\u2019t know where this kid was coming from, but he calls me up, he\u2019s doing a dissertation on Rupert Sheldrake and finds what we all who have looked into it know is that he was treated very unfairly. Not just by the skeptical community but by the scientific community in general.\n\nSo is there ever a retraction? Is the Pigasus Award ever proven wrong? They were certainly wrong about Charles Tart. They were certainly wrong about Rupert Sheldrake. Is there ever any room for correcting mistakes? And that\u2019s the problem. That\u2019s where it doesn\u2019t advance science. It doesn\u2019t advance science education. It just gets people polarized and entrenched and feeds the beast of uncritical thinking disguised as skepticism.\n\nD.J. Grothe: I don\u2019t know enough about Sheldrake\u2019s kind of personal narrative, his intellectual history and his engagement with other folks in his field to be able to agree with you or not. But you were conflating in my view his reception in science with his getting an award from a non-profit that poked fun at him a little. The Pigasus does that. The Pigasus Awards poke fun at what the JREF thinks are irresponsible researchers or others who aren\u2019t going in the direction we think good science goes, but that\u2019s another show. That\u2019s another debate.\n\nIt is not certainly the chief means by which we raise awareness about these sorts of issues. There are different approaches for different audiences. You might engage in high-minded research sometimes and you might have laugh-a-minute kind of poking fun of some other folks at other times. Both approaches are valid for different audiences. Here\u2019s an example. James Randi refers to paranormalists as \u201cpeddlers of woo-woo,\u201d right? That\u2019s a term that\u2019s taken off. A lot of people use that term. It is somewhat disparaging, I think. But there\u2019s room and reason to sometimes disparage irresponsible claimants.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to engage in the world of science, you don\u2019t call someone you disagree with a peddler of woo-woo. But the JREF doesn\u2019t only engage in the world of science. We try to educate the public about claims and when talking with ordinary, everyday folks, you use a different approach that might have more of a promise to meet new publics, to have more impact. So just as Richard Dawkins, to take in example, may sometimes refer to the religious as \u201cfaith heads,\u201d which is kind of disparaging, he\u2019ll other times engage in a high-minded debate with a believer. It just goes to show you there are different approaches for different times.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Boy, D.J., you\u2019ve circled us back now to the beginning of this interview and my question, \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just greatly admire the openness that you\u2019re bringing to this and the intellectual force you\u2019re bringing to it.\n\nBut having said that, I have to say that the last part of your argument I think completely falls apart. In the area of the competition for the cultural mindset, Dawkins is fair game to square off with believers when they\u2019re talking about ideas and philosophies. In the area of science, James Randi is completely inappropriate to use those kind of disparaging comments when what we\u2019re really trying to do is get away from that and get down to the data.\n\nWhat we really want to do is engage in substantive dialogue, like we\u2019ve just begun to do here, about the data. About the best way to approach the data. The best way to critically think about the data. There doesn\u2019t have to be a lot of personality involved in it.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Alex, the debate you\u2019re talking about there being between the skeptical and the community and the paranormal community or the believer community or whatever \u2014 I haven\u2019t really come up with a term to describe your side of the fence. The debate between those two communities is also the same debate that is now happening and should happen within the skeptical community. So to what extent do we feel comfortable telling someone we think is full of it that they are full of it or do we complain in a scientific way and say, \u201cOh, the evidence doesn\u2019t bear out your conclusion, etc.\u201d?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: It\u2019s not a matter of semantics and it\u2019s not a matter of political correctness. It\u2019s about engaging with the data. D.J., we engaged a little bit on the near-death experience data. The only way to engage it is the way that we talked about. You take the best research you can find and you compare and contrast. You weigh the evidence. You critically think about it and you arrive at some level of certainty about your conclusion. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s real simple. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re all really trying to do, those of us who are skeptical but open-minded.\n\nD.J. Grothe: And that\u2019s the direction the JREF is going. I think that\u2019s a heritage of the JREF thus far and we\u2019re only going to build on that and move further in this direction. The evidence is ultimately what matters to an educational foundation. That\u2019s what matters first and foremost, but other things also matter to an educational non-profit, and that is its mission to educate the public about critical thinking methods and what the best science says about these sorts of claims. The evidence is so important but also the way that you engage the public.\n\nHence our discussion on strategy as opposed to just talking about the evidence. When you\u2019re a researcher in your lab, you don\u2019t have to ever think about strategy. You just think about the research, the evidence. But when you\u2019re trying to bring that evidence to a wide audience and you\u2019re trying to educate the public about what the science says, or what the best evidence says about these sorts of claims, then you have to not only think about the evidence, but also about the strategy. I\u2019m here to express to you that that JREF is thinking about those strategies even as we hold our commitment to the evidence as utmost.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: D.J., you might just be the best hope for the skeptical community going forward. I certainly have to commend JREF for hiring you. It was a great, great find. We certainly wish you the best of luck.\n\nTell us real quickly what\u2019s coming up for you and for JREF in the near future that folks should know about.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Okay, I\u2019ll tell you that. And I\u2019ll also say that kind of ringing endorsement is just what it will take to get all the skeptics to say, \u201cOh my God, did we hire a plant from the paranormal community?\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cheer you to death, right?\n\nD.J. Grothe: Exactly. I guess I will share this anecdote. When I first got started with the Center for Inquiry a decade ago, I kid you not, Alex, a rumor went around a small circle of folks that I was actually a plant from the religious right. So I can\u2019t wait to brace myself for the possibility of people thinking, \u201cMy God, Alex likes D.J. so much, D.J. must be a paranormalist.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You\u2019ll get it, I\u2019m sure.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Okay, what\u2019s coming up next? In March the JREF is having its Skeptics of the Caribbean Cruise, if you\u2019re thinking Pirates of the Caribbean. Randi and myself and others along with a group of 80 or 90 skeptics, grassroots skeptic folks, are going to take a 10-day cruise in the Caribbean. That sounds like a vacation because it is, but it\u2019s also a great way for skeptics to get together, build community, talk about these issues.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you, just on the previous point you were talking about when we were getting into strategy versus just looking at the evidence? The thing that excites me the most about the skeptical world right now is this burgeoning grassroots movement that skeptics in the pub everywhere, where evidence is what\u2019s debated and talked about.\n\nYou would be welcome at any one of these across the country, Alex. Even as a believer, you show up, you say, \u201cI want to talk about NDEs and here\u2019s my evidence for it.\u201d These are open-minded inquirers who really want to engage. You\u2019re not going to be thrown out of the joint because you care about the questions. You belong. Now, it just so happens that the people who come to these sorts of events are skeptics, so there\u2019s a community-building aspect as well.\n\nWhat else is on the horizon? Of course, there\u2019s the Amazing Meeting this July. We think it will be our largest yet. Many of us think it\u2019s the best lineup we\u2019ve had in years, if ever, for the Amazing Meeting in Las Vegas. We\u2019ve recently expanded conferences internationally into the UK and later this year into Australia. At the Amazing Meeting in Vegas this July, it looks like we\u2019re going to have a big to-do as regards the Million Dollar Challenge.\n\nHell, maybe at one of these sorts of meetings or one of our regional things we get you involved to some extent. It would be fun to engage and not only fun but I think it would advance what we both care about, which are the questions.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019d be happy to be part of the loyal opposition.\n\nD.J. Grothe: You said that just like we planned on. [laughs] Just joking.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: D.J., certainly best of luck with that going forward. Again, thank you so much for not only joining me today, but for representing the kind of dialogue that can be difficult but can still advance critical thinking. I hope that\u2019s what we did today.\n\nD.J. Grothe: Yes. Thank you very much, Alex.
