The study didn\u2019t involve giving the supplements to people or comparing infection rates in those who use the compounds to those who don\u2019t.\n\nHemp is a source of fiber, food and animal feed, and extracts are commonly added to cosmetics, body lotions, dietary supplements and food.\n\n\u201cThese compounds can be taken orally and have a long history of safe use in humans,\u201d Richard van Breemen, a researcher with Oregon State\u2019s Global Hemp Innovation Center, noted in a statement. \u201cThey have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nThis latest study comes on the heels of another that found people who contract the omicron variant of the virus have an 83 percent less chance of winding up in an intensive care unit or dying than from the delta strain. Also, the Canadian study said, the risk of death or hospitalization, generally, from omicron is 65 percent less than the delta strain.\n\nThough the findings were seemingly positive, Canadian researchers issued a warning, nonetheless.\n\n\u201cWhile severity is likely to be reduced, the absolute number of hospitalizations and impact on the healthcare system may nevertheless be significant due to the increased transmissibility of Omicron,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, Omicron appears to demonstrate lower disease severity for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. While severity is likely to be reduced, the absolute number of hospitalizations and impact on the healthcare system is likely to be significant due to the large number of Omicron infections,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe Canadian findings mirror those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDCE, which found that Americans are being hospitalized 50 percent less amid the spread of the omicron variant in comparison to previous strains which produced record-high hospitalizations a year ago.\n\n\u201cEven though the rate of cases has more than tripled since Omicron emerged around Thanksgiving \u2014 earlier this week there were more than 1 million new cases diagnosed on a single day \u2014 just 3% of people with the virus are being admitted in hospitals, data from the CDC shows,\u201d the Daily Wire reported.\n\nThe Oregon State University study is not the first to find that cannabis offers protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nIn August 2020, Canadian researchers found similar benefits, according to DW.com.\n\n\u201cThe results on COVID-19 came from our studies on arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, cancer and others,\u201d Dr. Igor Kovalchuck, a professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Lethbridge, noted in an email to DW.\n\nHe went on to emphasize that the cannabis utilized for the study isn\u2019t the \u2018garden variety\u2019 that is used for recreational purposes.\n\n\u201cOur varieties are high in CBD, or balanced CBD/THC, because you can give a higher dose and people will not be impaired due to the psychoactive properties of THC,\u201d Kovalchuck explained.\n\nChris Albertyn, a Research Portfolio Lead at King\u2019s College London and an expert on cannabinoids and dementia, indicated in an interview with DW.com that the Canadian research showed promise.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, the current research from Canada has just unveiled a potential therapeutic \u2018mechanism of action\u2019 but that would need to be validated and tested in well-designed, robust clinical trials before any meaningful clinical conclusions can be drawn,\u201d he said.\n\nWhatever the case, this now-validated research proves that cannabis is a much safer alternative to vaccines found to contain unexplainable foreign objects.", "opengraph": {"title": "Another study finds that ingredients in cannabis block the virus that causes COVID-19", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2022-01-14-another-study-finds-ingredients-in-cannabis-block-virus-causing-covid-19.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "Researchers have uncovered a potential breakthrough in the non-vaccine-related treatment of COVID-19.
