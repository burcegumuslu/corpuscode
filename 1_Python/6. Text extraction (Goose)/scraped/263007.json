James Sunderland, a vehement supporter of mandatory WuFlu vaccination, told the media that because pets already require a vaccination passport in order to travel between the U.K. and Europe that the next step is for humans to have the same.\n\n\u201cWe must do everything possible to boost the economy by reopening our travel, hospitality, leisure, and business sectors, and how fantastic would it be to have our planes, trains, and boats full again,\u201d Sunderland stated, adding that mandatory vaccination for the Chinese Virus is \u201ca fantastic way of ensuring freedom of movement for people.\u201d\n\n\u201cA vaccination stamp is simple, would save all the hassle at either end, and really boost confidence.\u201d\n\nAviation Minister Robert Courts is likewise said to be \u201cupbeat and supportive\u201d of the idea, as is Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who stated earlier this month that his transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is in the process of \u201clooking at all such schemes\u201d that involve forcing people to get jabbed in order to resume traveling post-Covid.\n\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, December 5th, 2020 at 3:17 pm and is filed under Brave New World, Government Evil, Police State, World Politics.
