Experts Weigh In", "cleaned_text": "Earlier this month, the highly anticipated Omicron booster finally rolled out. This COVID-19 booster is specially designed to target Omicron strains of the virus, i.e. what\u2019s circulating right now, making it a good option to have in your COVID-fighting arsenal. But, of course, we\u2019re also entering flu season, making it the right time to get your annual flu shot.\n\nBut this leads us to wonder: can you get your flu shot and Omicron booster at the same time? The short answer is yes, but it\u2019s understandable to be a little wary of doubling up, especially if you\u2019ve had side effects from either shot in the past. Here\u2019s what infectious disease doctors and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend, so you can get both important vaccines, worry free.\n\nIs it safe to get the Omicron booster and flu shot at the same time?\n\nYes. \u201cThe influenza vaccine and the COVID-19 booster can be given at the same time,\u201d says Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThey have been studied in joint administration and there\u2019s no untoward effect.\u201d\n\nWhen the COVID-19 vaccines were first granted emergency use authorization (EUA), the CDC recommended waiting 14 days between getting that and any other vaccine, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. This was in order to make sure both vaccines would be effective and to minimize side effects. But the CDC now says that it\u2019s OK to get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines in the same visit.\n\nThe CDC notes that studies done throughout the pandemic \u201cindicate that it is safe to get both a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same visit.\u201d The CDC specifically cites a JAMA study that suggests that people who got a flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine at the same time were only slightly more likely to say they had side effects\u2014we\u2019re talking a difference of 11% with both shots at once compared to 8% of those who got them separately. \n\n\n\nBut is it a good idea to get the flu vaccine and Omicron booster at once?\n\nAgain, the CDC says you\u2019re perfectly fine to go this route. But doctors say you might want to consider a few things before you roll up both sleeves at once.\n\nAt a very basic level, you could be dealing with two sore arms, says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \u201cYou\u2019ll get an inoculation in each arm,\u201d he points out. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to do this and your body will deal with it in a perfectly normal way, but do you want to be walking around with two sore arms at once?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a slight chance you might have more side effects\n\nAgain, that JAMA study found that there\u2019s a slight chance you might have more side effects if you get both shots at once. According to the study, those included:\n\nWorth noting: Those reactions were mostly mild and went away quickly, per the study.\n\nSide effects will depend on your past reactions to both vaccines\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about worsening potential side effects, like a fever or feeling blah, if you get the vaccines together, Dr. Schaffner says that \u201ca lot will depend on your previous experience with the vaccines.\u201d Meaning, if you tend to get a slight fever after the flu vaccine and you got a fever after your COVID-19 vaccine, there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll experience the same if you get them together\u2014and possibly even more intensely than if you receive one at a time. Ditto for having a sore arm, or any other side effect.\n\nIf you\u2019re nervous about having your flu shot and Omicron booster at once, you can space them out\n\nAgain, you can absolutely get these shots together. But, if you\u2019re concerned and feel more comfortable spacing them out, Dr. Schaffner says you can definitely do that.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rule about how far you should space them apart because you can get them at the same time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I would suggest that, if you want to wait, you get one and then wait a few days to make sure you feel fine. Then, get the other.\u201d\n\nRuss Lampen, D.O., an infectious disease specialist with Spectrum Health, suggests waiting \u201cabout a week\u201d between shots \u201csince side effects for either the flu or COVID vaccine rarely last more than two days,\u201d he says.\n\nAs for which one to get first, Dr. Schaffner recommends going with your Omicron booster first. \u201cCOVID is out there now, so I would be included to get that booster first,\u201d he says. \u201cThen, get the influenza vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s more convenient for you to get both vaccines at once, then go for it,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. But, if you\u2019re nervous about that, consider spacing them out a few days.\n\nWhatever you do, doctors recommend getting both the Omicron booster and the flu shot. \u201cThe consequences of getting both COVID and the flu are not great,\u201d Dr. Russo says. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to get vaccinated.\u201d", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "Can You Get the Flu Shot and Omicron Booster at the Same Time?
