Posted in Latest news\n\nThe leftist U.K.-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) is back attacking the Media Research Center and complaining that Facebook isn\u2019t doing enough to silence those who question the left\u2019s eco-extremist take on climate change.\n\nLiberal media outlets are boosting the foreign CCDH\u2019s activism just as the White House was reportedly set to hold its first event tackling \u201cclimate change denial\u201d yesterday.\n\nNPR, Reuters, Forbes, The Hill, and The Washington Post all slobbered over CCDH\u2019s latest propaganda report headlined, \u201cFacebook failing to flag harmful climate misinformation, new research finds.\u201d\n\nThe report whined that \u201cFacebook is falling short of its promises to tackle climate misinformation.\u201d\n\nThe group flailed that its \u201cnew analysis\u201d found \u201cthat the platform fails to label half of the posts promoting articles from the world\u2019s leading publishers of climate denial.\u201d\n\nGroups listed in the attack were publications like NewsBusters, Breitbart, The Daily Wire, and The Washington Times.\n\nCCDH specifically targeted a NewsBusters article that noted in its headline that CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir and CNN Newsroom anchor Ana Cabrera were spewing \u201cAlarmist Climate Propaganda.\u201d\n\nWeir is the same person who published an insane climate letter to his newborn son in 2020 in which he said, \u201cthe milk in your bottle was warmed by dirty, ancient fuels and as a result, you will learn to walk on a planet that has never been this hot for humans.\u201d\n\nThis is the second attack by CCDH against the MRC in just roughly over three months.\n\nCCDH\u2019s leftist CEO Imran Ahmed bleated in the new report that, \u201cMeta is exacerbating the climate crisis. Climate change denial\u2014designed to fracture our resolve and impede meaningful action to mitigate climate change\u2014flows unabated on Facebook and Instagram.\u201d\n\nBut the CCDH is anything but impartial in the climate change debate. CCDH is funded by the Switzerland-based left-wing Oak Foundation, which the Capital Research Center labeled as \u201cThe Left\u2019s Green Giant.\u201d\n\nOak gave CCDH at least $100,000 in 2020 alone. Oak is involved in helping to fund efforts to green the Belt and Road Initiative, \u201ca global trade infrastructure project pushed by Chinese President Xi Jinping to link the communist country with the rest of Eurasia.\u201d\n\nAhmed has a history as an activist for Britain\u2019s leftist Labour Party. He also co-authored a book attacking free-market economist Friedrich Hayek titled \u201cThe New Serfdom: The Triumph of Conservative Ideas and How to Defeat Them.\u201d His gambit includes silencing conservative speech online altogether.\n\nSome of the headlines in the legacy media propping up CCDH\u2019s latest boohooing about its opponents shows they\u2019re not too keen about conservatives speaking freely about climate change either.\n\nNPR\u2019s story was headlined, \u201cFacebook fell short of its promises to label climate change denial, a study finds.\u201d\n\nThe faux free-market publication Forbes griped how \u201cClimate Change Denial Still Rife On Facebook, Say Researchers.\u201d\n\nReuters, which mentioned the CCDH\u2019s conniption over NewsBusters, headlined its story: \u201cFacebook did not label posts from top climate change deniers, report says.\u201d\n\nThe CCDH published a report in November 2021 called \u201cThe Toxic Ten\u201d that targeted the MRC, in addition to eight other conservative organizations for daring to challenge the left-wing climate-change fearmongering narratives.\n\nThose organizations were The Daily Wire, Breitbart News, The Washington Times, Townhall Media, Newsmax, The Federalist Papers, The Patriot Post, and The Western Journal.\n\nIt accused these organizations of producing \u201ccontent that sows climate change skepticism on social media platforms, creating the sense that there is a more extensive debate than there really is.\u201d\n\nWhat makes CCDH\u2019s latest attacks downright Orwellian is that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy was set to \u201chold a first-of-its-kind roundtable with some of the nation\u2019s leading scientists on Thursday to discuss\u201d climate change denial, according to a story in The Post.\n\nThe Post fawned that this new draconian initiative by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u201ccomes amid a reckoning over the spread of climate disinformation on social media platforms.\u201d\n\nThe Post continued: \u201cWhile Facebook pledged last year to attach \u2018informational labels\u2019 to posts about climate change in the United States and other countries, the platform has only labeled about half of the posts promoting climate denial.\u201d\n\nThe story also referred to CCDH simply as a \u201cwatchdog group,\u201d and did not point out its leftist bias. The Post and others reported on the event, but it is unconfirmed whether or not it took place.\n\nThis is the same script the CCDH, the White House, and the media used last time. The CCDH issued a report in 2021 called the \u201cDisinformation Dozen\u201d calling for people who dared question mainstream narratives on COVID-19 to be banned for pushing what it has determined to be \u201cdigital misinformation about Covid vaccines.\u201d\n\nPolitical affiliation didn\u2019t matter. Big Tech platforms targeted many who dared to question COVID-19 treatments, masking regulations, and more. Even the White House used the CCDH\u2019s report to push for more censorship online.\n\nIn response, Facebook reportedly took \u201caction against the so-called \u2018disinformation dozen.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe CCDH has now turned its sights on publications that challenge the end-of-the-world climate narratives, and the White House could be setting up the parameters for another censorship campaign in coordination with Facebook and other Big Tech companies.\n\nClimate Depot founder Marc Morano and Junkscience.com founder Steve Milloy lambasted the Biden administration\u2019s elevation of the CCDH propaganda in comments to the MRC.\n\n\u201cThis is our dystopian world of no deviation allowed from the official party line. If you dare disagree with the conclusions, statements, opinions or policies of those in power, you risk being censored, canceled, deplatfo[rm]ed, defunded, and ostracized,\u201d Morano stated, whose interview with NewsBusters was attacked in CCDH\u2019s \u201cToxic Ten\u201d report.\n\nMilloy, hammering a similar note, said \u201c[t]he left\u2019s agenda is so generally bankrupt of merit that it has been forced to viciously disparage opponents as racists and haters. This tactic, of course, began with climate.\u201d\n\nBoth Milloy and Morano excoriated the White House agenda to silence speech online that goes against its policy stances and for using the leftist CCDH as its north star.\n\n\u201cThis climate name-calling has now reached the White House which is hosting a summit on combatting \u2018climate denial\u2019 (whatever that means).\n\nThe summit has been coordinated with a dark money outfit ostensibly combatting \u2018digital hate\u2019, which has targeted media outlets that publish the views of climate agenda opponents,\u201d Milloy said.\n\nMorano slammed the White House for \u201ctrying to criminalize climate change skepticism. And well-funded progressives are more than willing to partner up with the government and Big Tech to enforce their idea of a climate \u2018consensus.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Milloy\u2019s view, CCDH\u2019s behavior is the death rattle of a dying eco-activist movement.\n\n\u201c[T]he public should not be fooled,\u201d he said. \u201cThe junk-science-fueled climate agenda is dying because of its own intellectual and moral bankruptcy. These efforts to disparage and silence opponents are the frantic last gasps of a nasty anti-American and anti-human movement.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title":
