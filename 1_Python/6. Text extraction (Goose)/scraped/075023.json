The corporate media blames it on \u201cavian influenza\u201d that\u2019s acquired from \u201cwild birds\u201d flying across the country, they claim. Because of these wild birds, tens of millions of chickens and turkeys have to be slaughtered, they insist.\n\nIt\u2019s a cover story to destroy the food supply and accelerate scarcity in both chicken eggs and chicken meat (as well as turkey meat).\n\nWhy do I suspect this? For starters, even the Wall Street Journal admits that a single positive test for an infection results in farmers being ordered to carry out a mass culling of their entire flock. From their story:\n\nEntire poultry flocks are destroyed after an infection is confirmed\u2026\n\nSo all it takes is a single infection \u2014 often diagnosed via a faulty PCR test that can be cranked up to generate false positives at will \u2014 to see millions of birds destroyed.\n\nAstonishingly, those destroyed birds are then counted as victims of the \u201coutbreak.\u201d\n\nParse the language very carefully from this WSJ article. It says:\n\nMore than 40 million egg-laying chickens have died in the current outbreak, according to USDA data\u2026\n\nImportantly, it doesn\u2019t say they died from avian influenza. They died from being culled.\n\nStated another way, the reason why so many birds are dead during an outbreak is because farmers are being ordered by health authorities to kill them.\n\nThe outbreak isn\u2019t killing these birds, the farmers are doing it under orders from the health authorities! And all those murdered birds are counted as victims of the \u201coutbreak.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another shocking tidbit to consider in all this: Commercial chickens are frequently vaccinated against various pathogens. But some of the vaccines make the pathogens even worse. According to left-leaning PBS.org, \u201cIn fact, rather than stop fowl from spreading the virus, the vaccine allows the disease to spread faster and longer than it normally would, a new study finds. The scientists now believe that this vaccine has helped this chicken virus become uniquely virulent.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re referring to a vaccine for Marek\u2019s disease. The study being cited is published in PLOS Biology, entitled, \u201cImperfect Vaccination Can Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens.\u201d\n\nThe study states an obvious truth that rarely gets acknowledged: That vaccines can cause pathogens to spread more aggressively and kill more subjects because they do not prevent transmission or replication. From the study abstract: (emphasis added)\n\nCould some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens? Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek\u2019s disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist.\n\nWhat the study is stumbling upon is the simpler answer to all this: Stop vaccinating the chickens and they will live longer as a whole.\n\nInstead of vaccinating chickens against influenza or other strains, then mass murdering them by the tens of millions every time a single case of something is discovered, it would actually be more humane (and cost effective) to allow natural immunity to emerge via the process of natural selection. Chickens that get infected with influenza and die are no longer capable of transmitting it to others. Those that are naturally immune can be used to hatch more baby chick, carrying forward the immunity. Within a very small number of generations, you end up with a chicken population that\u2019s (mostly) immune to influenza, or that can overcome such infections without dying.\n\nVaccines only cause more culling, including the culling of chickens that are naturally immune to avian influenza. Ask yourself this obvious question: Why would health authorities order farmers to kill birds that are naturally immune to avian influenza? The answer seems self-apparent: They are using the outbreak as a cover story to achieve depopulation of food-producing chickens, worsening food scarcity and food inflation at the same time.\n\nWhat they do to chickens today, they will do to humans tomorrow\n\nThe bigger realization in all this is that what health authorities are doing to chickens today \u2014 mass culling because of a single infection \u2014 they will do to humans tomorrow.\n\nHence the rolling out of the new WHO pandemic treaty and covid quarantine camps. In the eyes of the globalists, after all, you and I are just part of the human herd, and we are no different than cattle or sheep to them. Mass culling has always been the go-to tool for population control in animals, and they are using \u201coutbreaks\u201d as the excuse to kill tens of millions of them, including those who are naturally immune and could survive on their own.\n\nA key difference in all this, however, is that in humans, the jabs are the kill shots. Mass culling of chickens is often carried out through mass suffocation. They turn off the ventilation fans and chickens are trapped in their production prisons, being cooked and asphyxiated. Chicken production farms don\u2019t bother running around injecting each chicken with a kill shot.\n\nBut in humans, thanks to media propaganda and psychological operations, people can be convinced to line up and beg for the kill shots. How convenient for the globalists. They don\u2019t even have to forcibly round people up or murder them in gas chambers anymore. They merely need to roll out a plandemic, terrorize the population with covid scare stories, and present mRNA jabs as the solution. People line up by the billions to engage in vaccine-assisted suicide. Then the die-offs begin. Right now in the United States, we already have over one million excess deaths since the vaccine push began, and excess mortality numbers from Ed Dowd \u2014 author of the new book Cause Unknown (available at BrighteonBooks.com) \u2014 reveal that around 2,460 excess deaths of Americans are happening each day.\n\nThat\u2019s around 900,000 Americans each year. It\u2019s not as dramatic as the culling of tens of millions of chickens in one year, but then again chickens don\u2019t write their congresspeople and complain. When chickens are slaughtered en masse, few people notice. Ironically, even as 1+ million Americans are dying from the vaccines, few people notice that, either, and some keep telling themselves that deaths are only happening because of a lack of vaccines.\n\nDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that as mass deaths accelerate, everyone will wake up and realize what\u2019s happening. Through media propaganda and psychological operations, people can be brainwashed into dismissing mass death even as it\u2019s happening to their own friends and family members. And remember, dead vaccine victims don\u2019t compose tweets, either. The dead can no longer sound the alarm.\n\nMy backyard chickens are unvaccinated and free range, and they aren\u2019t dying from avian influenza\n\nI\u2019ve maintained backyard egg layers, by the way, for over a decade. Although chickens die from natural causes and old age \u2014 yes, mine end up dying from old age because I don\u2019t kill them \u2014 my chickens have never suffered an avian influenza mass death event. And they prance around all day in a free range environment with no fences and no boundaries. They encounter plenty of other birds and water fowl, yet have never suffered any sort of outbreak causing mass death.\n\nSo if the narrative we\u2019re told is true \u2014 that \u201cwild birds\u201d are infecting chickens with dangerous pathogens, and that\u2019s why we need to kill millions of chickens \u2014 then why aren\u2019t my chickens dead from influenza?\n\nThe answer is obvious: I don\u2019t vaccinate them, and I don\u2019t keep them confined to artificial indoor buildings. They experience the natural world and eat natural chicken food sources like bugs and small lizards. They drink water from a pond that\u2019s teeming with bacteria, yet they\u2019re fine and healthy. Their immune systems work well, and never once have I thought, \u201cOh geesh, guess I need to kill them all because one of them might be sick!\u201d\n\nThe USDA is a murder factory, and state-based health authorities are brainwashed by Germ Theory pushers who don\u2019t understand much at all about raising healthy animals in the natural world. Sadly, they apply their bad ideas to human pandemics, too, which is why they can only think of one thing to do in every single case: More jabs.\n\nIf jabs were the answer, the chickens wouldn\u2019t need to be culled.\n\nIf jabs were the answer, vaccinated individuals wouldn\u2019t be getting sick and dying.\n\nIf jabs were the answer, then unjabbed people would be dying in droves\u2026 but precisely the opposite is happening.\n\nThis is why, by the way, we need small family farms and a wholesale decentralization of the food production infrastructure across America. We don\u2019t need Tyson Foods to feed America, we need farmer Bob and Jane to have small, manageable flocks all across the country, providing eggs and meat to local communities. Those flocks don\u2019t need mass vaccinations or mass culling. They need to be raised with respect for natural immunity and the natural world.\n\nThat\u2019s how we achieve food security, redundancy and affordability.\n\nLearn more on this topic and much more in today\u2019s Situation Update podcast:\n\n\u2013 Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas\n\n \u2013 Breaking down the total junk science fraud of the claim that unvaxxed are \u201cbad drivers\u201d\n\n \u2013 Almost HALF the people involved in \u201ccar accidents\u201d were unvaxxed PEDESTRIANS or passengers!\n\n \u2013 Canadian government uses Santa Claus psyop to terrorize children if they aren\u2019t vaccinated\n\n \u2013 Egg prices set to explode yet again as mass culling of chickens accelerates\n\n \u2013 WSJ admits that a single \u201cpositive\u201d influenza test (PCR fraud) results in mass culling\n\n \u2013 After millions of chickens are killed, USDA announces \u201cmillions dead from outbreak\u201d\n\n \u2013 The chickens are all vaccinated, too, so how are they getting sick if vaccines work?\n\n \u2013 If \u201cwild birds\u201d are making chickens sick, why aren\u2019t my own chickens dying constantly from sickness?\n\n \u2013 It\u2019s all a coordinated attack on the food supply to create scarcity and food #inflation\n\n \u2013 Coal is now the top energy source in the world\n\nDiscover more interviews and podcasts each day at:\n\nBrighteon.social: Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger (my breaking news gets posted here first)\n\nJoin the free NaturalNews.com email newsletter to stay alerted about breaking news each day.\n\nDownload my current audio books \u2014 including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind \u2014 at:\n\nDownload my new audio book, \u201cResilient Prepping\u201d at ResilientPrepping.com \u2013 it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mass chicken culling based on \u201cavian influenza outbreaks\u201d just another malicious attack on the FOOD SUPPLY", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2022-12-23-mass-chicken-culling-another-attack-on-the-food-supply.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "Have you noticed all the reports this year of \u201cmass culling\u201d of millions of chickens and turkeys?
