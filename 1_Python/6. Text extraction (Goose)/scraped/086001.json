Twenty-one percent of women did not receive any vaccine. Eighty-four percent of the unvaccinated and 35% of the women with a single dose of the\u00a0vaccine refused further doses during pregnancy. The most common concern was the fear that the vaccine might cause harm to the fetus (35.3%), followed by the fear of vaccine-related reactions (25.4%). Also, 14.6% of women feared that the vaccine might cause them to abort the ongoing pregnancy. Thirteen percent of women stated their intent to receive the vaccine after they were informed regarding its safety and requirement. No difference was found in the acceptability of the vaccine based on the educational status of women or on the monthly income of the families.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Adequate communication regarding safety information on COVID-19 vaccines is a must for\u00a0pregnant women and their families to provide reassurance about the need and safety of the vaccines.
