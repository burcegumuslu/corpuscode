A mid-2022 report from the university stated that he had delivered grants to Sul Ross\u2019 Center for Big Bend Studies (CBBS) for 21 years. But these accolades did not matter to the university, which fired Keller while he was in the midst of three significant projects.\n\n\u201cIt was humiliating, sad and infuriating all at the same time. That was my career, my livelihood and much of my identity. To fire me in such a swift and cavalier manner felt very unfair considering my time there,\u201d Keller told Texas Monthly following his firing. The archaeologist added that he had been planning to retire in five years\u2019 time if he was not unceremoniously terminated.\n\nHe recounted the university informing him: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell you why, and we appreciate your service, and you need to pick up your stuff and go.\u201d\n\nSeveral Sul Ross officials kept silent on the details of why Keller was axed from his position.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how there\u2019s a story here,\u201d CBBS program coordinator Michelle Lacey-Olivares told the Daily Caller. Further pressing by the outlet led her to remark that Keller himself \u201cknows why he was fired.\u201d\n\nCBBS Director Bryon Schroeder, meanwhile, said Keller\u2019s termination was not his decision. \u201cIt was an issue that came to life with the university. It was a university decision,\u201d he said before refusing to comment further.\n\nSul Ross President Carlos Hernandez did not reply to requests for an interview. Provost Louis Harveson refused to speak about Keller\u2019s termination as it was a \u201cpersonnel issue.\u201d According to Keller, Harveson was the one who informed him of his dismissal.\n\nKeller\u2019s supporters attended his Jan. 27 going-away party at the Hotel Ritchey in Alpine, Texas. Several attendees who had collaborated with the archaeologist described him as the most virtuous and hardworking archaeologist in far West Texas. While most wanted to know the real reason for his dismissal, others were angry at how the issue was managed.\n\nAccording to the now-dismissed archaeologist, Sul Ross\u2019 decision to terminate him stemmed from his work at Big Bend National Park near the Mexican border. Prior to his firing, Keller\u2019s work permit there had been suspended. He added that even Harveson himself told him that his research at the park had something to do with his termination.\n\nThings may be pointing in this direction, as Keller is believed to have posed a threat to the narrative. Only two years ago, he found evidence that a group of Mexican boys and men were shot to death in 1918 by Texas Rangers and suspected members of the U.S. Cavalry. He allegedly found the remains of the victims while digging at Big Bend.

They suspended his work permit, but added that the archaeologist was dismissed before \u201cany concerns could be cleared up.\u201d\n\nTyranny.news has more stories like this.\n\nWatch Graham Hancock expound on the global control of archaeology in the video below.\n\nThis video is from the Brian Ruhe channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nArchaeologists discover ancient tombs filled with actual GIANTS\u2026 \u201cunusually tall and strong\u201d people once roamed the planet.\n\nArchaeologists discover ruins of Mayan civilization in Guatemala using LiDAR technology.\n\nBible stories come to life: Archaeologists unearth extraordinary mosaic showing what might be Jesus feeding the 5,000 with five loaves.\n\nScientists uncover \u201cinvisible\u201d ancient Hebrew inscription that can only be seen with advanced technology.", "opengraph": {"title": "Well-known archaeologist mysteriously fired from his job, and no one wants to say why", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2023-02-14-well-known-archaeologist-mysteriously-fired-from-job.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "Archaeologist and university professor David Keller was mysteriously fired from his job at Sul Ross State University in Texas back in December of last year, but no one wants to say why.
