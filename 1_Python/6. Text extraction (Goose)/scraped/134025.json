Only the mRNA platform itself has been approved\n\nAccording to the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, \u201cthere are no current mRNA vaccines licensed for use in beef cattle in the United States.\u201d However, a lobbyist for the association claims to have \u201cdouble-vaccinated\u201d his own herd with an mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d against bovine respiratory disease\n\nMissouri House Bill 1169 would require labeling of products that can alter your genes. Big Ag lobbyists strongly oppose it\n\nLast week, I reported that pork producers have been using customizable mRNA-based \u201cvaccines\u201d on their herds since 20181 \u2014 without telling the public. This issue really only rose to the surface after attorney Tom Renz started promoting new legislation in Missouri (House Bill 1169,2 which he helped write) that would require labeling of mRNA products.3 In an April 1, 2023, tweet (and no, this was not an April Fool\u2019s joke), Renz stated:4\n\n\u201cBREAKING NEWS: the lobbyists for the cattleman and pork associations in several states have CONFIRMED they WILL be using mRNA vaccines in pigs and cows THIS MONTH. WE MUST SUPPORT MISSOURI HB1169. It is LITERALLY the ONLY chance we have to prevent this \u2026 NO ONE knows the impacts of doing this but we are all potentially facing the risk of being a #DiedSuddenly if we don\u2019t stop this.\u201d\n\nThe Transhumanist Agenda and Its Focus on Food\n\nWithin days, alternative media was abuzz with this story and Renz started making the rounds sharing evidence that shows the U.S. government has been working on the integration of vaccines into foods for at least two decades. In an April 2, 2023, interview with Naomi Wolf, Ph.D., Renz said:5\n\n\u201c[Bill] Gates, the WHO [World Health Organization], a ton of these universities: they\u2019re all talking about including mRNA vaccinations as part of the food. They\u2019re going to modify the genes of these foods to make them mRNA vaccines.\u201d\n\nIndustry Doesn\u2019t Want You to Know What They\u2019re Doing\n\nThe pushback by Big Ag lobbyists against this bill to require industry transparency on this important issue has been enormous, and one potential reason for that is because they\u2019d have to admit that all sorts of foods may have been vaccinated with mRNA vaccines, have genetic modifications, or be modified to serve as vaccinations for humans.\n\nNot only might this destroy Big Ag, but it would also seriously impact any surreptitious attempts by Big Pharma to use the food supply as a tool to distribute vaccines unbeknownst to consumers.6 In short, Renz suspects the globalists\u2019 transhumanist agenda is being secretly pushed forward using gene therapy in food production.\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder whether the industry simply doesn\u2019t understand how mRNA gene therapy in livestock might affect consumers, or whether they want to conceal the fact that they\u2019re using gene therapy because they DO know it can also affect humans.\n\nGlobalists like World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab have openly admitted that they intend to alter humanity \u2014 both on the genetic level and through the incorporation of artificial intelligence and nanotechnology into the human body.\n\nAnd, using COVID-19 as the cover, they managed to turn the entire world population into test subjects for this dangerous experimentation. As noted by Renz in the Real America\u2019s Voice interview above, we know for a fact that the mRNA COVID shots have no beneficial impact in terms of preventing COVID infection.\n\nIf the mRNA COVID shots don\u2019t prevent infection, why would we assume mRNA shots for viral and bacterial infections in swine work any better? One of the most disturbing aspects of using mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d in swine is the fact that all of them are by definition untested. As explained by Merck on its website, its \u201ccustom swine vaccine,\u201d\n\nSequivity, is not a vaccine but, rather, a platform that allows for the endless customization of \u201cmRNA vaccines.\u201d The customized mRNA shots that are created using it are completely untested. Here\u2019s how it works:7\n\u2022 None A pathogen is collected and sent to a diagnostic lab.\n\u2022 None The gene of interest is sequenced and sent electronically to Sequivity analysts.\n\u2022 None A synthetic version of the gene of interest is synthesized and inserted into the RNA production platform.\n\u2022 None The RNA particles released from incubated production cells are harvested and formulated into a customized \u201cvaccine.\u201d\n\nAs noted by Zoetis, the largest producer of veterinary drugs and vaccines:8 \u201cSequivity has safety and efficacy studies based on the platform with a historical initial isolate, not likely the isolate that customers would be requesting in their product.\u201d\n\nWhat was that initial isolate? Will mRNA against a bacterial disease affect the animals in the same way that mRNA against a viral infection does? What \u201cgenes of interest\u201d are being chosen? If spike proteins are selected, might they be as pathogenic as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?\n\nIn CAFO environments with high populations of animals, won\u2019t mutations become rampant as the bacteria and viruses are subjected to constant \u201ccustomized\u201d vaccination pressure to adapt and become more dangerous? These are just some of the questions that need answers.\n\nAt the end of the day, the fact that mRNA shots can be endlessly customized without safety testing shows just how broken the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are.\n\nThere\u2019s simply no way they can guarantee that customized mRNA shots are safe. The fact that the platform itself works and allows for this customization does NOT prove the safety and effectiveness of the shots being cooked up. Approval of the platform also does not prove the food is safe for consumption after it\u2019s been treated with mRNA.\n\nAs reported by Dr. Peter McCullough,9 Chinese researchers have demonstrated that food can indeed be turned into a vaccine.10\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s food supply can be manipulated by public health agencies to influence population outcomes \u2026 Now an oral route of administration is being considered specifically for COVID-19 vaccination using mRNA in cow\u2019s milk.\n\nZhang and colleagues have demonstrated that a shortened mRNA code of 675 base pairs could be loaded into phospholipid packets called exosomes derived from milk and then using that same milk, be fed to mice.\n\nThe mice gastrointestinal tract absorbed the exosomes and the mRNA must have made it into the blood stream and lymphatic tissue because antibodies were produced in fed mice against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (receptor binding domain) \u2026\n\n[G]iven the damage mRNA vaccines have generated in terms of injuries, disabilities, and deaths, these data raise considerable ethical issues. The COVID States project has shown that 25% of Americans were successful in remaining unvaccinated.\n\nThis group would have strong objections to mRNA in the food supply, particularly if it was done surreptitiously or with minimal labelling/warnings \u2026\n\nFor those who have taken one of the COVID-19 vaccines, having milk vaccines as an EUA offering would allow even more loading of the body with synthetic mRNA which has been proven resistant to ribonucleases and may reside permanently in the human body.\n\nThese observations lead me to conclude that mRNA technology has just entered a whole new, much darker phase of development. Expect more research on and resistance to mRNA in our food supply. The Chinese have just taken the first of what will probably be many more dangerous steps for the world.\u201d\n\nWill Beef Be Treated With mRNA Too?\n\nAt present, there\u2019s no evidence to suggest beef cattle are being treated with customizable mRNA \u201cvaccines,\u201d either in Europe11 or the U.S. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association has also denied it, saying \u201cthere are no current mRNA vaccines licensed for use in beef cattle in the United States.\u201d12,13\n\nThat said, the Cattlemen\u2019s Association previously confirmed they do, eventually, intend to use mRNA shots in cattle,14,15 which might affect both dairy and beef. Time will tell whether public outrage will halt such plans. Clearly, the Cattlemen\u2019s Association is concerned about internet rumors that it\u2019s already in use.\n\nApril 3, 2023, Texas Department of Agriculture commissioner Sid Miller issued a statement promising to conduct a risk assessment of the technology before its adoption:16\n\n\u201cSince news of the development of mRNA vaccines and mRNA-related treatments for livestock came to the attention of the Texas Department of Agriculture, we have been working towards developing a fact and science-based assessment of the risks associated with this technology.\n\nOur analysis will include the clinical research, the structure of existing Texas law, and the public policy, economic, and production impact of the different policy prescriptions we may adopt. I aim to ensure that Texas agriculture remains safe, trusted, healthy, and wholly uninfected by dangerous or unproven technology.\n\nI personally take this issue very seriously. No political hot takes. Just a well-reasoned and well-researched proposal based on a wide range of input from stakeholders, scientists, agriculturalists, and other experts. We are looking at this issue at TDA and will share your concerns. Please stay tuned \u2026\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s causing significant confusion on this issue is a statement made by National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association lobbyist Shannon Cooper17 before the Missouri House.18 Cooper told the House members he had recently \u201cdouble-vaccinated\u201d his herd with \u201cvaccinations that have this mRNA.\u201d According to Cooper, the mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d given was for bovine respiratory disease.\n\nIs he confused? Did he mistakenly believe the vaccine he gave had mRNA in it? Or is the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association incorrect in stating there are no approved mRNA vaccines for cattle in the U.S.? Or, are experimental mRNA shots being used without approval? Who knows at this point?\n\nWhat we do know is that mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d against bovine respiratory disease are being developed. Iowa State University began trialing an mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d against bovine respiratory syncytial virus October 1, 2021.19 The project end date is listed as September 30, 2026.\n\nAccording to the trial submission, mice would be used to establish proof of concept. Cows would be used in year two of the trial. Assuming they\u2019re on schedule, that means cows will be experimented on somewhere in late 2023 and/or 2024.\n\nConsidering health authorities insist the COVID shots are safe, it\u2019s no wonder they also insist there are no problems associated with eating mRNA-treated meat. But can we trust them? What about the cells now highjacked by the foreign mRNA instruction to create novel proteins? Are these proteins safe to consume? How long are the nano-lipid particles preserved in the tissue?\n\nLivestock such as swine are routinely vaccinated against several diseases,20 and many of these vaccines must be administered at specific times to ensure there\u2019s no residue left in the meat. So, just when are swine receiving these customized mRNA shots? And could there be mRNA vaccine remnants in the pork you buy?\n\nVaccines are nearly always given in the hindquarter of the animal, and according to mRNA jab developers, the mRNA remains at the injection site. This theory has long since been proven false, as the mRNA in the COVID jab gets has been shown to be distributed throughout the human body.\n\nBut it makes sense that the mRNA might be more concentrated at the injection site. In livestock, this could be bad news, seeing how the hindquarters are usually where the prime cuts of meat come from.\n\nSo, knowing whether there\u2019s any mRNA left in the animal at the time of slaughter is important. At present, we have no way of knowing this. We don\u2019t even know exactly how long the synthetic lipid-enveloped mRNA stays in the body.\n\nWe also don\u2019t know how long the antigen produced by the animal\u2019s cells in response to a customized mRNA shot sticks around, and whether ingesting that antigen might have repercussions for human health.\n\nStanford researchers found the spike protein produced in response to the COVID shot remains in the human body for at least 60 days,21,22 and the spike protein is what\u2019s causing most of the health problems associated with the jab. Could the same be true for mRNA jabs used in animals? Hogs can be killed anywhere from the age of 6 weeks to 10 months, which doesn\u2019t allow a whole lot of time for the mRNA and/or antigen to get flushed out.23\n\nAside from the many open questions, the fact that notorious Big Pharma mouthpieces are the ones cited by media, ensuring us that mRNA jabbed animals are safe to eat is yet another red flag. In this case, we have Dr. Kevin Folta insisting the mRNA is harmless.\n\nFolta, a University of Florida horticulture professor, is a longtime advocate for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). He has also advocated for the safety of glyphosate, and in 2015, he was caught lying about his financial ties to Monsanto. Now, he\u2019s taken up the advocacy for mRNA shots in livestock. As reported by Cowboy State Daily:24\n\n\u201cLawmakers in Arizona, Idaho, and Missouri have introduced legislation related to the use of mRNA vaccines in food. The Arizona bill only restricts labeling such food as organic. The Idaho bill amends state law to prohibit the sale of such foods unless conspicuously labeled that the presence of the vaccine is in the food.\n\nThe Missouri bill requires a conspicuous \u2018Gene Therapy Product\u2019 label. Dr. Kevin Folta told Cowboy State Daily the proposed \u2018gene therapy\u2019 label is inaccurate.\n\nIt \u2018means they have no idea what they are trying to regulate,\u2019 Folta said, because \u2018there is no integration into the DNA. It\u2019s a transient set of instructions, like a USB drive. Not a hard drive\u2019 \u2026 Messenger RNA occurs naturally as part of the function of cells in the body. \u2018mRNA is everywhere, and you cant live without mRNA,\u2019 Folta said \u2026\n\nFolta said that the vaccines can\u2019t get into the food people eat. \u2018mRNA is an extremely unstable molecule. That\u2019s why it works. It\u2019s very temporary. So when an animal is slaughtered or when a plant dies, mRNA is the first thing to go,\u2019 Folta said.\u201d\n\nMany of you will know exactly what\u2019s wrong with Folta\u2019s arguments that mRNA is \u201ceverywhere\u201d and therefore harmless, and that its activity is temporary because it\u2019s so unstable. The mRNA in the shots is synthetic and does NOT break down the way normal mRNA does.\n\nHe is clearly misleading people, and it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s not intentional, considering the fact that everyone who knows even the slightest bit about mRNA jab technology knows the synthetic mRNA has been designed to prevent rapid breakdown and is further stabilized by the nanolipid. So, Folta\u2019s arguments are null and void from the get-go.\n\nMoving forward, it\u2019s going to be extremely important to stay on top of what\u2019s happening to our food supply. Many of us were surprised to realize mRNA shots have been used in swine for several years already. Soon, cattle may get these customizable mRNA shots as well, which could affect both beef and dairy products.\n\nFor now, I strongly recommend avoiding pork products. In addition to the uncertainty surrounding these untested mRNA \u201cvaccines,\u201d pork is also very high in linoleic acid, a harmful omega-6 fat that drives chronic disease. Hopefully, cattle ranchers will realize the danger this mRNA platform poses to their bottom-line and reject it. If they don\u2019t finding beef and dairy that has not been \u201cgene therapied\u201d could become quite the challenge.\n\nWill Harris, from White Oak Pasture in Bluffton Georgia, is a rancher who has already come out against mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d in cattle. An April 10, 2023, White Oak Pastures tweet stated:25\n\n\u201cThere is talk about domesticated food animals soon being vaccinated with mRNA. We want our customers to know that we will not vaccinate our animals with mRNA vaccines. We believe there is a time and place for vaccinations, but they must be used sparingly.\n\nIf livestock are raised in an environment where they can express their natural instincts, they probably wont need many (if any) vaccines. We hope to one day move away from all vaccines on our farm \u2014 we are close, but not there yet.\n\nEveryone should know that over 80% of the antibiotics produced today are consumed by domesticated food animals \u2026 It would only make sense that in order for vaccine companies to move from \u2018very profitable\u2019 to \u2018obscenely profitable\u2019 would be to capture the animal agriculture market.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that this would ever pass legislation, but law or not, Big Ag is highly influenced by Big Pharma. The multinational meat companies would certainly choose to mandate this if there was an opportunity for a shared profit.\n\nIn closing, please know: We don\u2019t believe in a blanket, one-size-fits-all approach to our health or our livestock. We will not add vaccinations for our livestock \u2014 we are moving in the other direction hoping to give fewer. (And, we already give very few).\n\nIf this is adopted and there is a \u2018panic\u2019 for food from livestock that hasn\u2019t had the MRNA vaccine, we will choose to honor the demand from our loyalty members and employees first. If you are not a part of that group, we cannot guarantee we will have any product for you.\n\nWe are certainly not trying to promote panic \u2014 but, we do intend to notify our customers of how we will operate in times of growing demand. We screwed up during the pandemic \u2014 we won\u2019t do that again.\u201d\n\nNational vaccine policy recommendations in the U.S. are made at the federal level but vaccine laws are made at the state level. It is at the state level where your action to protect your vaccine choice rights can have the greatest impact.\n\nIt is critical for EVERYONE to get involved now in standing up for the legal right to make voluntary vaccine choices in America because those choices are being seriously threatened.\n\nNot only are lobbyists representing drug companies, medical trade associations and public health officials trying to persuade legislators to strip all vaccine exemptions from public health laws, but global political operatives lobbying the United Nations and World Health Organization are determined to take away the human right to autonomy and protection of bodily integrity.\n\nWe must take action to defend our constitutional republic and civil liberties, including the right to autonomy, in America. That includes reforming oppressive mandatory vaccination laws and stopping the digital health ID that will make vaccine passports a reality for us, our children and grandchildren if we don\u2019t take action today.\n\nSigning up to use the free online Advocacy Portal sponsored by the National Vaccine Information Center at www.NVICAdvocacy.org gives you immediate, easy access to your own state and federal legislators on your smartphone or computer so you can make your voice heard.\n\nNVIC will keep you up to date on the latest bills threatening to eliminate \u2014 or expand \u2014 your legal right to make vaccine choices and give you guidance about what you can do to support or oppose those bills.

If you have a different perspective on a story about vaccination that appears in your local newspaper, write a letter to the editor.\n\nI must be frank with you: You have to be brave because there is a lot of censorship of conversations that challenge \u201cofficial\u201d narratives about vaccination. You likely will be strongly criticized for daring to talk about the \u201cother side\u201d of the vaccine story and for defending your informed consent rights. Be prepared for it and have the courage to stand your ground.\n\nOnly by sharing our perspective and what we know to be true will the public conversation about vaccination open up so people are not afraid to talk about it.\n\nWhile our rights are being threatened, the vaccine injured are being swept under the carpet and treated like nothing more than statistically acceptable \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of one-size-fits-all mandatory vaccination laws. Way too many people are being put at risk for injury and death and there is nothing scientific or moral about that. We should not be treating human beings like guinea pigs.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above. Follow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.
