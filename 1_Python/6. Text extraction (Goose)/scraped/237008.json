If you suspect #sideeffects, get medical attention and report your symptoms to @PEI_Germany,\u201d a tweet from the German Ministry of Health said.\n\nIt later tweeted a correction that the number 5,000 refers to doses instead of individuals: \u201cCorrection: According to @PEI_Germany, the reporting rate of serious reactions is 0.2 reports per 1,000 vaccine doses.\u201d\n\nThis is a strange and welcome admission from a government about the scope of injuries caused by the COVID vaccines.\n\nNevertheless, the one person in 5,000 doses figure is too low. The second tweet explained that it was a reporting rate of serious reactions, so probably it refers to the rate of adverse events reported to the German equivalent of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). If that is the case, then there should be an underreporting factor of around 10, which means the real number of severe side effects may be 10 times higher.\n\nOne reason why the one person in 5,000 doses figure is low is due to deaths being counted separately from severe side effects. Deaths are counted as deaths, so the one person in 5,000 doses figure only covers people who were severely injured by the COVID shots and survived.\n\nIf a person died from the shot, either instantly or a few months later, they were never registered as a vaccine-injured person. (Related: UK hospital data shocks the world: 80% of COVID deaths are among the vaccinated\u2026 COVID deaths up 3,000% after vaccine wave.)\n\nThe Germans are in fact excellent at monitoring vaccine safety. Besides their passive reporting system, the German medicine regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute or PEI, manages an active vaccine safety monitoring app called SafeVac 2.0. The data from this monitoring tool was incorporated in a Europe-wide report on vaccine safety last month and it showed that 0.3 percent of vaccine recipients in Germany reported at least one severe adverse reaction to the first dose of the vaccine.\n\n1,838 participants reported at least one serious adverse reaction after receiving first dose of COVID vaccine\n\nThe report mentioned that of the 520,076 participants from Germany who had received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 1,838 (0.3 percent) reported experiencing at least one serious adverse reaction.\n\nThese German numbers are in accordance with the overall rates across Europe. It must be noted, however, that a rate of 0.3 percent is 15 times higher than the rate of 0.2 per 1,000 (i.e., 0.02 percent) as quoted in the tweet.\n\nThe big question is why the German government used the 0.02 percent figure instead of the 0.3 percent figure from its advanced vaccine safety monitoring tool when drawing attention to vaccine side effects.\n\nConcerns about high rates of severe vaccine side effects have been raised before in Germany. In May, Professor Harald Matthes, a scientist heading an independent study into the safety of the vaccines, stated that based on his data around 0.8 percent of vaccinated people in Germany have experienced severe side effects.\n\nThe figure is not surprising since it agrees with what is known from other countries like Sweden, Israel and Canada. Even the manufacturers of the vaccines may have already known this during their studies.\n\nMeanwhile, an Israeli government survey found that 0.3 percent of vaccinated people reported being hospitalized as a result of their COVID vaccination, while a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) survey discovered that 0.9 percent of vaccinated people reported seeking medical care as a result of their vaccination.\n\nFollow VaccineInjuryNews.com for more news about the vaccine injuries and deaths caused by the COVID vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below to know why the largest physician union in Germany warned that the COVID vaccine is deadly.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nAs Boris Johnson resigned, UK officials quietly released data showing that covid death rate is highest among fully vaccinated.\n\nOfficial government data from Germany suggests covid fully vaccinated people will develop AIDS.\n\nA massive COVID wave in Germany and Central Europe despite high vaccination.", "opengraph": {"title": "German government admits COVID vaccines cause severe side effects", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pandemic.news/2022-07-26-germany-admits-covid-vaccines-cause-severe-injury.html", "site_name": "Pandemic News", "description": "The German government publicly admitted on Wednesday, July 20, that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines can cause\u00a0severe side effects for one person in every 5,000 doses. \u201cOne in 5,000 people is affected by a serious side effect after a COVID19 #vaccination.
