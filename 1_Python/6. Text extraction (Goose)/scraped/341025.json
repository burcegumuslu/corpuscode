Except when it is State Sanctioned\u201d, wherein it states: \u201cNursing homes are a captive target...For every nursing home resident killed, a spot opens up to cycle in another body to be 'disposed of' quickley as possible...Over time, the death assembly line ensues...It is not just happening in Michigan, or New York, or CA...It is a planned strategy being executed across the country, using Covid as the ruse...For profit corporate greed cares not for Humans or Human Life\u201d.\n\nAs to if Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden has actually launched a seniorcide \u201cdeath assembly line\u201d for \u201ccorporate greed\u201d, though, a few hours ago new evidence emerged showing this is true\u2014and was when America\u2019s top three leftist corporate media giants simultaneously published within minutes of each other the exact same propaganda article\u2014with the New York Times publishing their front page article \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 Vaccine Found to Be 79% Effective in U.S. Study\u201d, the Washington Post publishing their front page article \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s U.S. Trial Shows Vaccine Is 79 Percent Effective\u201d, and the Wall Street Journal publishing their front page article \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 Vaccine Is Safe, 79% Effective In Late-Stage U.S. Trials\u201d.\n\nThis coordinated mass propaganda campaign is otherwise known as a \u201cmedia echo chamber\u201d\u2014that refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal\u2014and that Biden and his socialist forces urgently needed after what occurred on Saturday, which was when two hospital staffers in Denmark experienced blood clots and cerebral hemorrhaging after they were vaccinated against Covid-19 with AstraZeneca's jab, with one quickly dying\u2014and saw this tragedy occurring following the shocking revelation on Friday, which was when German researchers, led by professor Andreas Greinacher at the University of Greifswald, said in a statement that they believe the AstraZeneca vaccine, in some cases, prompts overactivation of platelets in the blood, which can then cause potentially deadly clots, and said it's similar to what happens with a condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\n\nAs exhaustively documented and reviewed by the Security Council on 14 March, both Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccines against COVID-19 are based on decades of Ebola virus research using killed viruses, which also makes them effective against all COVID variants\u2014while the COVID vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Moderna are based on Messenger RNA, otherwise known as mRNA, and is a live virus vaccine that can provoke a rapid immune response flooding the body with white cells leading to blood clots\u2014and in the just released scientific research paper \u201cSARS-CoV-2 Variants With E484K Mutation Show mRNA Vaccine-Induced Antibody Evasion\u201d, it\u2019s now been discovered that mRNA vaccines are not effective against COVID variants.\n\nMost critically being kept hidden from the American people by Biden\u2019s leftist \u201cmedia echo chamber\u201d is that the fragile mRNA molecules used in COVID-19 vaccines can\u2019t get into cells on their own\u2014and is why they need lipid nanoparticles, otherwise known as LNPs\u2014and the LNPs used in COVID-19 vaccines contain just four ingredients: Ionizable Lipids, whose positive charges bind to the negatively charged backbone of mRNA, Pegylated Lipids, that help stabilize the particle, and Phospholipids and Cholesterol Molecules, that contribute to the particle\u2019s structure\u2014and thousands of these four components encapsulate mRNA, shield it from destructive enzymes, then shuttle it into cells where the mRNA is unloaded and used to make proteins.\n\nIf the American people were allowed to know the truth about mRNA vaccines, they would quickly discover that the use of lipid nanoparticles as a drug delivery mechanism was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration just three years ago as part of a treatment for a disease that only affects about 50,000 people worldwide\u2014but in not knowing, unwittingly makes them guinea pigs in the largest experiment in human history using a vaccine with unproven very dangerous technology that\u2019s already demonstrated it can kill and won\u2019t even be effective in the long term against COVID. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report, fully supporting Biden and his socialist forces as they terrorize their nation of guinea pigs is the World Economic Forum (WEF), which is funded by its 1,000 member companies, typically global enterprises with more than five billion dollars in turnover\u2014are in reality the richest and most powerful Western socialist-globalist elites\u2014are using this pandemic to change the entire world via their demonic master plan they call \u201cThe Great Reset\u201d\u2014and to aid in this master plan sees them having established their Center For The Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nOn his last day in office, this report notes, President Dwight Eisenhower gave a farewell address to the American people and warned them about the \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d that was threatening their nation and its freedoms\u2014though to his gravest warning, it saw him stating: \u201cThe prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded...Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite\u201d.\n\nLost to the memories of the American people today, however, this report details, is that the \u201cscientific-technological elite\u201d forces President Eisenhower warned about he knew well\u2014specifically its ideological leader Albert H.Z. Carr, whose 1940\u2019s book \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Chance\u201d was the first to use the phrase The Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2014that Carr asserted would usher in modern communications, merely as an additional manifestation of the industrial revolution\u2014as the beginnings of a new phase, a fourth industrial revolution\u2014then saw him warning the American people that their democratic way of life was at risk and his suggesting a technological revolution as the way forward\u2014and since then, historians and scientists have proclaimed this \u201cnew\u201d revolution\u2019s commencement with the arrival of atomic energy in 1948.\n\nAs history has proven, this report further notes, the warning issued by President Eisenhower about these \u201cscientific-technological elite\u201d forces were subsumed by those supporting Carr\u2019s vision of a \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d\u2014the consequences of which has led to unrestrained and unregulated technological advancements in America\u2014whose immediate importance of noticing is because of a report issued by the ETC Group on 28 January 2003 entitled \u201cThe Big Down: Technologies Converging At The Nano-Scale\u201d, wherein it shocked the entire world by revealing: \u201cThe world\u2019s most powerful emerging technology is developing in an almost-total political and regulatory vacuum...Public and private research at the nano-scale is evolving beneath the radar screen of civil society and government regulators...Because nano-scale technologies can be applied to virtually every industrial sector, no regulatory body is taking the lead...And because many of its products are nano-sized versions of conventional compounds, regulatory scrutiny has been deemed unnecessary\u201d.\n\nWith the New York Times calling this ETC Group document \u201cthe most elaborate effort yet to generate alarm about nanotechnology\u201d, this report continues, three years later, in their warning document \u201cGlobal Risks 2006\u201d, the World Economic Forum was forced to brand nanotechnology as one of the greatest threats our world faces\u2014after which the Western corporate mainstream media and socialist-globalist elites went into near total silence about nanotechnology advancements\u2014that is until the COVID pandemic started, which then saw them all promoting with massive propaganda nanotechnology mRNA vaccines\u2014and most interesting to notice, saw the pandemic beginning and nanotechnology mRNA vaccines being introduced shortly after a Davos summit at the World Economic Forum concluded that a \u201cdigital dystopia\u201d of the Western world had been achieved, and them declaring: \u201cIf democracy cannot adapt to these new conditions, then humans will come to live under the rule of digital dictatorship\u201d.\n\nWith this weekend having seen massive \u201cFreedom Protests\u201d against the scamdemic and nanotechnology mRNA vaccines breaking out throughout the Western world, this report concludes, it was interesting to notice them being joined by police crackdowns against massive youth gatherings in France, the United States and United Kingdom\u2014massive gatherings of defiant young people in these Western nations tired of having to submit themselves to tyrannical socialist scamdemic rule\u2014and are made even more noticeable because of the over 1,000 defiant young people in America arrested by violent police forces simply because they want to enjoy their lives\u2014after which America displayed how truly socialist demented it is when the White House released a photo of the Easter Bunny wearing a mask.\n\nMarch 22, 2021 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
