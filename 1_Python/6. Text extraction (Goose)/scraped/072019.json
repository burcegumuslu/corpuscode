Is there any truth to this? The answer is of course not.\n\nTake the claimed ranges, for instance. Whatever you hear about the distance an EV can travel in one charge, cut that in half during the winter season and you have a more accurate reading. Then there\u2019s load and towing capacity, the figures for which are also overblown.\n\n\u201c\u2026in the case of electric trucks \u2013 when used to do the things trucks are expected to do, such as pull a trailer\u2026 Instead they were only told \u2013 as in the case of Ford\u2019s F-150 Lightning electric truck \u2013 that it could pull a 10,000 pound trailer. Which is true. Just not for long. Or rather, far,\u201d reports Eric Peters Autos about this deception.\n\n\u201cLeft out was the relevant fact that if they attempted to actually pull a trailer, they\u2019d be stopping for a lengthy recharge every 80 miles or so. They were also told they could recharge at home \u2013 which is also true. As far as it goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they were not told how very long that takes. Instead, they were led to believe they could get going again in only 30-45 minutes or so. But that is only possible by visiting so-called \u2018fast\u2019 chargers, which are not at home.\u201d\n\nEVs are dirty, dangerous, and unreliable: why does the green cult like them again?\n\nJerome Corsi, writing for American Thinker, also tackled this subject, noting that there is nothing economically viable about converting to EVs.\n\nThe entire EV push is driven by ideology rather than practicality or what he describes as \u201crational economic calculation.\u201d This is part of the reason why four Wyoming state senators and two representatives have introduced a bill to ban all sales of EVs in Wyoming by the year 2035.\n\n\u201cWyoming\u2019s vast stretches of highway, coupled with a lack of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, make the widespread use of electric vehicles impracticable for the state,\u201d reads Senate Joint Resolution No. SJ004, adding that \u201cthe batteries used in electric vehicles contain critical minerals whose domestic supply is limited and at risk of disruption.\u201d\n\nShould left-wingers devoted to green causes ever successfully ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles, especially if the ban includes industrial and commercial vehicles, there are major safety and reliability implications to consider as well. What happens when an EV semi-truck dies by the side of the road in the middle of a blizzard in the middle of nowhere? What will become of the driver and his payload?\n\nThen there are the environmental implications of continuing to have child slave laborers dig up all the rare-earth minerals needed to produce EV batteries, which the same proposed legislation in Wyoming warns \u201care not easily recyclable or disposable, meaning that landfills in Wyoming and elsewhere will be required to develop practices to dispose of these minerals in a safe and responsible manner.\u201d\n\nFinally, where is all that extra electricity going to come from to charge these things? There are already electric infrastructure problems plaguing certain states at certain times of the year because the current setup is inadequate even for existing quantities of EVs out on the road. What will happen once the entire country is converted to EVs?\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care that it won\u2019t work,\u201d one commenter wrote about all this. \u201cThey want everyone to live in cities and only go where they are told by walking or riding a bike. You will own nothing and be happy.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the EV push and the lies that often accompany it can be found at GreenTyranny.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Electric vehicles are a SCAM \u2013 here\u2019s why", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2023-02-03-electric-vehicles-are-a-scam-heres-why.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "There is a disturbing overlap between the marketing that was used to sell masks and \u201cvaccines\u201d during the covid scamdemic and the push to convert society to electric vehicles (EVs) only.
