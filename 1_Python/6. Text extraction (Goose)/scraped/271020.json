(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\n More Americans are warming up to COVID-19 vaccines, with 19% saying they\u2019ve already received at least one dose and 49% expressing intent to do so when they get the chance, according to new poll results.\n\nAltogether, 69% of U.S. adults surveyed by the Pew Research Center now intend to become vaccinated.

At that point, the virus will have difficulty finding new hosts to infect, and the outbreak will come to an end.\n\nNearly 29 million Americans have had coronavirus infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. But experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say even those who have recovered from an infection should get vaccinated because the protection is likely to be more long-lasting.\n\nMore than half of those surveyed \u2014 58% \u2014 said that the emergence of new coronavirus variants has increased the urgency for Americans to get vaccinated. Strains from South Africa and Brazil were less susceptible to vaccines in clinical trials, and others \u2014 including one that emerged in California \u2014 have shown signs of vaccine resistance in laboratory tests. Health officials have also urged vaccination as a way to get ahead of more transmissible strains, such as the one from the United Kingdom.
