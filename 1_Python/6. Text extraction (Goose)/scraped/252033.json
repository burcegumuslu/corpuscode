Rand Paul tears apart DHS disinfo governance board \u2013 aka Ministry of Truth", "cleaned_text": "InfoWars founder Alex Jones touched on the criticism lobbed at the Disinformation Governance Board (DGB), under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nIn a recent episode of \u201cThe Alex Jones Show,\u201d the host played footage of a May 4 Senate hearing where Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) rebuked DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The lawmaker argued that the DGB has no authority to serve as the arbiter of truth, given that people \u201ccan\u2019t even agree [on] what disinformation is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the problem: We can\u2019t even agree [on] what disinformation is. How are we ever going to come to an agreement on what is disinformation so you can police it on social media? I think you\u2019ve got no idea what disinformation is, and I don\u2019t think the government [is] capable of [policing] it.\u201d\n\nPaul also accused the government of being the No. 1 purveyor of disinformation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust government to figure out what the truth is, [because it] is largely disseminating disinformation. Do you know [who] the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The U.S. government.\u201d\n\nMayorkas defended the DGB and its role, telling the Kentucky senator: \u201cWhere we become involved is where there is a connectivity between disinformation and threats to the security of the homeland.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say your new [DGB] is going to help the public with disinformation. You claim it is not going to be about domestic; it is going to be about foreigners \u2013 those evil Russians,\u201d said the Kentucky senator. \u201cYou think we can\u2019t determine [if] speech by traffickers is disinformation? You think the American people are so stupid, they need you to tell them what the truth is?\u201d\n\nJones put in his two cents about the exchange. \u201cIf you watch what the corporate establishment puts out, [these] disinformation boards [are] stuff right out of fictional dictatorships. Something only a few countries have: North Korea, communist China [and] Stalinist Russia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou think this is cartoonish, this is like textbook tyranny? Well, that\u2019s because that\u2019s what this is. They have taken us being asleep and us putting up with all this garbage as a green light \u2013 a big, giant, green light \u2013 to come after everybody.\u201d\n\nAside from Mayorkas himself, DGB Executive Director Nina Jankowicz also became the target of the GOP during the hearing. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) asked Mayorkas if he was aware of \u201cprecocious\u201d videos Jankowicz posted on social media \u2013 to which the DHS secretary answered in the negative. (Related: Biden\u2019s new \u2018disinformation\u2019 head caught in a lie on first day in role.)\n\nThe lawmaker from Louisiana alluded to a video where the DGB head referred to herself as the \u201cMary Poppins of disinformation.\u201d In another clip, Jankowicz sang about her new role to the tune of the 1964 song \u201cSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\u201d which was used in the film \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not aware of that. We do not discuss the internal hiring process,\u201d said Mayorkas. \u201cIt is my understanding that Ms. Jankowicz is a subject matter expert in the field in which she will be working on behalf of the department. Ultimately, as the secretary \u2013 I\u2019m responsible for the decisions of DHS.\u201d\n\nThe InfoWars founder pointed out that while Jankowicz has claimed liberals and minorities have been censored on social media, the studies actually show that conservatives \u2013 not liberals \u2013are the true victims of censorship.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s already this allegation that there is anti-conservative bias on the platforms, even though there has been study after study proving, in fact, that often it\u2019s liberal voices that are being silenced \u2013 particularly minority voices in social media. So I think we\u2019re [going to] see more allegations of that, the DGB head claimed in a video.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying there\u2019s no censorship, even though they\u2019re on record saying they\u2019re [going to] censor and want more censorship. But when you say you don\u2019t want it, [they say] \u2018Oh it doesn\u2019t exist,\u2019 except it\u2019s happening to minorities. So that\u2019s something else they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Jones.\n\nDisinfo.news has more stories about the DGB and criticism against it.\n\nWatch the full segment of \u201cThe Alex Jones Show,\u201d featuring the exchange between Paul and Mayorkas.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nNew DHS \u201cDisinformation\u201d unit is designed to spread the government\u2019s disinformation while criminalizing TRUTH.\n\nDeSantis: Biden\u2019s \u2018Ministry of Truth\u2019 set up to \u2018perpetuate hoaxes\u2019 and silence critics.\n\nHomeland security\u2019s \u201cdisinformation board\u201d is even more pernicious than it seems.", "opengraph": {"title": "Sen.
