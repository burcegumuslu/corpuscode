And based on a new initiative geared toward their investors, the World Health Organization (WHO) certainly seems to be taking advantage of the situation.\n\nWHO luring investors, using fear tactics to promote the massive production of COVID-19 vaccines\n\n\u201cNo-one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d This is a direction quote from the WHO in their latest document, released June 26, which explains the \u201cAccess to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.\u201d\n\nSuch foreboding statements seem a bit out of place in official documents like this, but given the amount of fear-mongering we\u2019ve seen elsewhere in the media about COVID-19, we can\u2019t say we\u2019re totally shocked to see it.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the ACT Accelerator is a program initially launched in April 2020 at an event co-hosted by the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The program intends to promote collaboration between \u201cgovernments, health organizations, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists\u201d in order to \u201cspeed up the end of the pandemic by supporting the development and equitable distribution of the tests, treatments and, vaccines\u201d for COVID-19, the pandemic illness caused by a new type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2\n\nAre we really to believe that world health officials want to \u201cspeed up the end of the pandemic?\u201d\n\nThe cost for the ACT-Accelerator program is expected to exceed $18 billion. And, the ultimate aim is to disseminate over 2 billion COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.\n\nWith this kind of money and reach at stake, it\u2019s no wonder the WHO and its big pharma investors want to keep people ignorant about what they can do to support their immune system. Whatever it takes to make sure the population remains uneducated to protect their investment, right?\n\nAt a time when public health officials demand face masks and business closures, you have other options for protecting yourself and your family\n\nSo, what can you do, in lieu of just waiting for a vaccine that may or may not be effective and safe? In addition to searching back through some of our natural solutions for boosting immunity, we also encourage you to incorporate these tried-and-true strategies into your family\u2019s daily routine, inspired by the Cleveland Clinic:\n\u2022 None Eating nutrient-dense whole foods, especially garlic (rich in a compound allicin) and antioxidant/vitamin C-rich options including (organic) citrus fruits, berries, and (dark) leafy green vegetables\n\u2022 None Managing stress through meditation, deep breathing exercises, and other mood-boosting activities\n\u2022 None Physical exercise (any kind that you enjoy enough to do regularly \u2013 research shows that just 30 minutes of brisk walking can boost immunity)\n\u2022 None Getting enough sleep (7-9 hours per night \u2013 try sleeping in a pitch dark room, since this boosts the hormone melatonin that regulates your biological clock)\n\u2022 None Using supplements and essential oils, including vitamin C, D, milk thistle, magnesium, zinc, selenium plus lavender and eucalyptus essential oils.\n\nNo doubt, there are many wonderful ways to keep your immune system healthy and strong.
