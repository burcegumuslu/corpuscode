Limited hours for restaurants, mandatory masking and proof of COVID-19 vaccination were still required in most public spaces.\n\nStarting Feb. 1, nightclubs will be allowed to operate again and restaurants will be allowed to remain open past 10 p.m. Customers of either venue will no longer be required to present proof of vaccination upon entry.\n\nCommuters taking buses will no longer need to wear masks, and capacity limits placed on shops will be lifted.\n\nThe only restrictions that will remain are COVID-19 testing and isolation requirements for people entering the country. This requirement will remain in place until March.\n\nIn making this momentous move, Denmark follows in the footsteps of Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. (Related: Lifting of Britain\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions could be part of giant PSYOP to gain back people\u2019s trust.)\n\nBut the three other aforementioned countries are keeping some COVID-19 measures in place. Denmark, on the other hand, is scrapping all of its domestic restrictions entirely.\n\nEngland was the first country to announce a loosening of restrictions, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing an end to the mask mandate as part of the nation\u2019s return to \u201cPlan A\u201d measures.\n\nIreland followed, with Prime Minister Micheal Martin announcing an end to the nation\u2019s system of vaccine passports.\n\nEngland and Ireland were followed by Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands.\n\nMost of Europe is also putting in place plans to roll back most COVID-19 restrictions. Norway is planning to gradually get rid of restrictions since the country\u2019s public health authorities have accepted that only \u201cextreme\u201d measures can deal with the omicron variant.\n\nEven France and Austria, which have been putting extreme pressure on the unvaccinated to take the vaccines, have begun relaxing some of its regulations.\n\nIsrael now #1 in covid cases per capita, proving all the draconian vaccinations, lockdowns and restrictions are utterly worthless and stupid.\n\nTruth will set you free: Danish newspaper apologizes for failing to report the truth about COVID pandemic.\n\nVaccine DAMAGE now ubiquitous in Denmark as \u201cOmicron\u201d hospitalizations occur primarily in \u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d\n\nWatch this clip of Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announcing Denmark\u2019s transition to a completely restriction-free society on Feb. 1.\n\nThis video can be found in the channel The Willow on Brighteon.com.\n\nLearn more about the state of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions around the world by reading the latest articles at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Welcome to the life we knew before: Denmark is abolishing ALL COVID-19 restrictions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2022-01-29-denmark-abolishing-all-covid-restrictions.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "Denmark has announced that it will end all of its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions by next week.
