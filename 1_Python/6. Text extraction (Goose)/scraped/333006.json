Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief litigation counsel for Children\u2019s Health Defense.\n\n\u201cOnly the tsunami of propaganda and censorship from the pharma/government biosecurity cartel and the controlled media persuaded the public that Pfizer and Moderna were better at protecting the human immune system than God and evolution,\u201d he added.\n\nThe study found that immunity acquired from infection was often far more robust and consistently waned more slowly than the immunity from two doses of an mRNA vaccine.\n\nThe researchers found that natural immunity was at least 88.9% effective against severe disease, hospitalization and death for all COVID-19 variants 10 months after infection.\n\nIt also provided 78.6% protection against reinfection for all variants except omicron BA.1, for which protection was 45.3%.\n\nAt an October 2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, the CDC presented data showing that vaccine-acquired immunity after two or three injections dropped to zero six months after injection, and then became negative.\n\nThe Lancet study stated that \u201calthough protection from reinfection from all variants wanes over time, our analysis of the available data suggests that the level of protection afforded by previous infection is at least as high, if not higher than that provided by two-dose vaccination using high-quality mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech).\u201d\n\nThe study was funded in part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Authors included Dr. Christopher Murray, director of The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Gates-funded institute that was \u201clargely responsible for the notoriously exaggerated mortality calculations that overestimated COVID deaths by 20-fold at the COVID pandemic\u2019s outset,\u201d according to Kennedy.\n\nThe authors argued, based on their findings, that natural immunity should be recognized along with vaccines when authorities are considering restricting travel, access to venues and work based on immunization status.\n\nCommenting on these conclusions, Dr. Meryl Nass, internist and epidemiologist, said:\n\n\u201cWhile framing this as an acknowledgment that natural immunity confers protection, what it is also doing is providing tacit agreement that government-imposed policies restricting travel are acceptable. It furthermore provides tacit approval of vaccine passports.\u201d\n\nIn October 2020, The Lancet published an article \u2014 \u201cScientific consensus on the COVID-19 pandemic: we need to act now\u201d \u2014 by authors including CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, which was widely covered in the mainstream press. They stated that \u201cthere is no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection\u201d and that \u201cthe consequence of waning immunity would present a risk to vulnerable populations for the indefinite future.\u201d\n\nBut in November 2021, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request forced the CDC to admit that it didn\u2019t even collect data on natural immunity.\n\nThen, in January 2022, the CDC was compelled to revise its position on natural immunity, acknowledging in a report that natural immunity against COVID-19 was at least three times as effective as vaccination at preventing people from becoming infected with the Delta variant.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies were also aware of the benefits of naturally acquired immunity, although they suppressed that information, documents revealed.\n\nIn October 2021, Project Veritas exposed three Pfizer officials saying that antibodies lead to equal if not better protection against the virus compared to the vaccine, The Defender reported.\n\nLater, in April 2022, Pfizer documents held by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and released under court order confirmed Pfizer knew natural immunity was as effective as the company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine at preventing severe illness, journalist Kim Iversen reported.\n\nMost recently, the Twitter files revealed that a Pfizer board member who used to head the FDA lobbied Twitter to take action against a post accurately pointing out that natural immunity is superior to COVID-19 vaccination, The Epoch Times reported.\n\nFOIA requests also revealed that Dr. Anthony Fauci and his boss, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, colluded to suppress the Great Barrington Declaration, which argues that natural immunity plays an important role in mitigating public harm from COVID-19, The Defender reported.\n\nThe vaccines are failing, which means we need more vaccines\n\nMedia that reported on the study, including NBC, ABC and U.S. News & World Report, continue to advocate for vaccination as the more important way to protect against severe disease and death from COVID-19.\n\nThis is despite the fact that even vaccine advocates Bill Gates and Fauci admitted that COVID-19 vaccines perform poorly.\n\nIn a paper published last month in Cell Host and Microbe, Fauci and his co-authors confirmed that the predominantly mucosal respiratory viruses, including influenza, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and common colds \u201chave not to date been effectively controlled by licensed or experimental vaccines.\u201d\n\nThey concluded, \u201cDurably protective vaccines against non-systemic mucosal respiratory viruses with high mortality rates have thus far eluded vaccine development efforts.\u201d\n\nNass said that while it is quite significant for The Lancet to publish these findings about natural immunity, the authors\u2019 framing, like the admissions by Gates and Fauci, \u201cis intended to quietly, without apology, veer away from current COVID vaccines, while implying that more money is needed to develop new types of vaccines. No one made any mistakes. No one accepts any blame. Chris Murray never erred with his outlandish estimates. No, just send money and let us do the science.\u201d\n\nby Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. \u2013 originally published on The Defender", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Covid Vaccine", "mRNA", "herd immunity"],
