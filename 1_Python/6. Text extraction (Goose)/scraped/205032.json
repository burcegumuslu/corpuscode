Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in addition to other pharmaceutical executives and government leaders, claimed that the vaccines would prevent the spread of the virus when the jabs were initially rolled out in December 2020.\n\nJanine Small, who serves as president of international development markets for Pfizer, testified before the European Parliament\u2019s COVID-19 committee Monday on behalf of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla. The Pfizer CEO was summoned by the committee, but he ultimately pulled out of the scheduled hearing.\n\nDutch Member of Parliament Rob Roos, a vocal opponent of Europe\u2019s mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies, asked Small whether Pfizer could provide lawmakers with evidence it believed their mRNA vaccine would prevent transmission before heading to market.\n\n\u201cWas the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?\u201d Roos asked, according to TheBlaze. \u201cIf not, please say it clearly. If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?\u201d\n\nIn response, the executive admitted that Pfizer did not know whether the vaccine would stop transmission before it was rolled out. \u201cRegarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market? No,\u201d Small admitted.\n\n\u201cThese, um, you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market. And from that point of view, we had to do everything at risk,\u201d she added.\n\nA number of European nations \u2014 including France, Germany and the U.K. \u2014 required proof of vaccination for a number of everyday activities. Proof of vaccination was required to travel, enter public venues and seek certain medical procedures.\n\nRoos, along with a handful of his colleagues in the European Parliament, was firmly opposed to vaccine passport programs. After the hearing, Roos stated that Pfizer\u2019s admission nullified the entire legal basis for vaccine passports.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get vaccinated, you\u2019re anti-social! This is what the Dutch prime minister and health minister told us. You don\u2019t get vaccinated just for yourself, but also for others \u2014 you do it for all of society. That\u2019s what they said,\u201d Roos stated. \u201cToday, this turns out to be complete nonsense.\u201d\n\nRoos said Small\u2019s admission \u201cremoves the entire legal basis for the COVID passport. The COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find this to be shocking, even criminal,\u201d Roos added.\n\nIn the United States, Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine received emergency use authorization on December 11, 2020. It later received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on August 23, 2021.\n\nIn granting an emergency use authorization to Pfizer in late 2020, the FDA wrote that there was no evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.\n\nBut when the vaccines were initially rolled out, a number of health and government leaders \u2014 including President Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 claimed the vaccine would stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,\u201d Biden said during a CNN town hall in July 2021. The president continued to claim that vaccinated individuals could not spread the virus until early 2022, repeatedly referring to the pandemic as \u201ca pandemic of the unvaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,\u201d Biden said in a December 2021 interview with an Ohio news station. \u201cThe unvaccinated. Not the vaccinated, the unvaccinated. That\u2019s the problem. Everybody talks about freedom and not to have a shot or have a test. Well guess what? How about patriotism? How about making sure that you\u2019re vaccinated, so you do not spread the disease to anyone else.\u201d\n\nAfter cases exploded to record numbers well after the mass vaccination campaign was underway, government leaders and health officials began to walk back their promises. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) maintains that COVID-19 vaccination significantly lowers the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death for infected individuals.\n\n\u201cLike all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection. Some people who are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations will get COVID-19 breakthrough infection,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cHowever, staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccinations means that you are less likely to have a breakthrough infection and, if you do get sick, you are less likely to get severely ill or die.\u201d\n\nPrior to the vaccine\u2019s approval, Pfizer claimed that studies showed its vaccine was as much as 91.3% effective against COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing infections.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer Exec Admits COVID Vaccine Was Never Proven to Stop Spread", "description": "A top executive at Pfizer admitted Monday that the company never knew whether their mRNA COVID-19 vaccine would stop the spread.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/pfizer-exec-admits-covid-vaccine-was-never-proven-to-stop-spread/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-10-12T20:18:59+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pfizer-Vaccine-Stop-Spread.jpg", "image:width": "960", "image:height": "540", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Joe Biden", "Rob Roos", "COVID-19", "European Union", "Pfizer", "Europe", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "Albert Bourla"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The truth about the vaccine is coming out at last. <a href=\"https://t.co/HQxv8wVu35\">pic.twitter.com/HQxv8wVu35</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1580214077128724480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">800 participants enrolled in South Africa with 0 cases of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> observed in the vaccinated group.
