Doctors Explain", "cleaned_text": "The monkeypox virus continues to spread across the country and the world. In New York City, cases have doubled in the past week while supply of the monkeypox vaccine \u201cremains low,\u201d according to health officials. People in Dallas County, Texas, who attended the Daddyland Festival over Fourth of July weekend are also being encouraged by public health officials to monitor themselves for signs of monkeypox after someone who went to the event later tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe World Health Organization is planning to reconvene the week of July 18 or sooner to decide whether monkeypox should be declared a global health emergency, the WHO\u2019s highest alert level, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual news conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging people who are considered high risk for monkeypox to get vaccinated against the virus, and it\u2019s understandable to have questions about the vaccine, including its side effects. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is the monkeypox vaccine?\n\nThere are actually two monkeypox vaccines licensed for use in the U.S.\u2014ACAM200 and JYNNEOS (which also go under the names Imvamune or Imvanex). They\u2019re licensed to prevent smallpox but also work to prevent monkeypox, per the CDC.\n\nACAM2000 is given as a live virus preparation that\u2019s given by pricking the skin surface, the CDC explains. A lesion\u2014called a \u201ctake\u201d\u2014will develop at the site of the vaccination, but the virus that grows at the site of the lesion can be spread to other parts of the body or even to other people. Because of this, people who are vaccinated with ACAM2000 have to take special precautions to avoid spreading the virus. People who get the vaccine are considered fully vaccinated after 28 days.\n\nJYNNEOS is also a live virus vaccine but it\u2019s non-replicating\u2014meaning, it can\u2019t spread or make you sick. It\u2019s given as two injections four weeks apart and there\u2019s no visible \u201ctake,\u201d the CDC says. People who get the JYNNEOS vaccine are not considered vaccinated until two weeks after they get the second dose of the vaccine, the CDC says.\n\nJYNNEOS is the preferred vaccine that\u2019s used in the U.S., says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo. \u201cIt\u2019s considered an improvement on ACAM2000 because it doesn\u2019t replicate,\u201d he says. It can also be given to people who are immunocompromised and have eczema, he points out\u2014 ACAM2000 can\u2019t.\n\nWhat are the monkeypox vaccine side effects?\n\nIt depends on which monkeypox vaccine you get. In general, the CDC says that the following can be side effects of the JYNNEOS vaccine:\n\nThe following may be side effects of the ACAM2000 vaccine, per the CDC:\n\nJYNNEOS \u201cwas designed to be less reactogenic than traditional smallpox vaccines and is comparable to routine vaccines in terms of injection site reactions,\u201d says Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agrees, noting that people tend to do \u201cvery well\u201d with the JYNNEOS vaccine.\n\nHow do you protect against monkeypox?\n\nExperts say that monkeypox isn\u2019t something the general public should worry about at this point. \u201cIt is not very contagious outside of close contact,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. But, he adds, \u201cif someone thinks they are at risk for monkeypox because of their activities and exposures, they should seek vaccination either before they engage in those activities or after they have been exposed.\u201d\n\nThe CDC also recommends the following to protect against monkeypox:\n\u2022 Avoid close, skin to skin contact with the monkeypox rash.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t touch the rash or scabs of person with monkeypox.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t kiss, hug, cuddle, or have sex with someone with monkeypox.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t handle or touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person with monkeypox.\n\u2022 Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after contact with sick people.\n\nThe CDC also recommends that the following people be vaccinated against monkeypox:\n\u2022 People who are personal contacts of patients with monkeypox\n\u2022 People who may have been exposed to the virus\n\u2022 People who have increased risk of being exposed to the virus, such as people who perform laboratory testing to diagnose monkeypox\n\nIs there a cure for monkeypox?\n\nThere is not a cure for monkeypox, but there doesn\u2019t really need to be, Dr. Schaffner says. \u201cFor the most part, this is a self-limiting infection and all of these lesions resolve over a period of two to four weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cMost people recover without specific therapy.\u201d\n\nHowever, antiviral medications like tecovirimat (TPOXX) may be prescribed for people who are immunocompromised or more likely to get severely ill from monkeypox, he says.\n\nDr. Russo points out that \u201ccases of monkeypox are creeping up a bit\u201d in the U.S., noting that \u201canyone can get this through close contact.\u201d His advice: \u201cBe cautious about having close contact with anyone with skin lesions and ulcers.\u201d", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "What Are the Side Effects of the Monkeypox Vaccine?
