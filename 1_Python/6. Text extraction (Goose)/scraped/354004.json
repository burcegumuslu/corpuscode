I jotted down these notes based on the issues I remembered when my son was a preschooler. I hope you find it helpful.\n\nMargaret\u2019s Recommendations:\n\n Colloidal Silver \u2013 a great multi-functioning immune product. Good for stomach bugs, colds, flus, earaches, eye infections, insect bites, etc. This is colorless and flavorless \u2013 it can hide in water, juice, or milk. It can be used topically, taken internally, and can go in nose, eyes and ears. Some moms give it daily for prevention.\n\nNew and Different \u2013 K12 \u2013 a probiotic strain formulated for ear, nose and throat health. Comes in both kid and adult chewables. Feedback is very good on this.\n\nMy favorite immune booster \u2013 Elderberry Defense \u2013 Daily use of this product has resulted in perfect attendance for my son for several years running. It comes in both chewable and capsule.\n\nStress Busters \u2013 this is an important category \u2013 my son used to have trouble sleeping after watching commercials on ABC Family.\n\n Calming Essence \u2013 a gentle homeopathic that is good for all ages. Good for all kinds of stress \u2013 both real and imagined. My son used to call this \u201csleep medicine\u201d.\n\n B vitamins & Omega 3 oils \u2013 for chronic stress, these help.\n\nFlower Essences \u2013 these are for particular patterns. A good example is a child who is terrified of school and cries all day \u2013 Mimulus for general fear worked great. Elm is another one that is for someone who tries to be perfect and stresses our when they fall short. There are 38 remedies for things like daydreaming, grief, impatience, etc.\n\nAllergies / Asthma \u2013 my least favorite topic \u2013 no simple answers.\n\n 1. Get rid of thrush / yeast / fungus. Either knock it back with silver, or take a daily probiotic.\n\n 2. Identify significant food allergies and eliminate as much as you can from day to day.\n\n 3. Fill in nutritional gaps \u2013 a good multi-vitamin and / or greens.\n\n 4. Allergy drops, both herbal and homeopathic for symptoms.\n\n 5. Eczema responds similarly. Follow 1-4 above.\n\nCoughs \u2013\n\n Spongia Tosta \u2013 for croupy cough\n\n Kid\u2019s Cough \u2013 herbal cough syrup \u2013 tastes bad, works good\n\n Eucalyptus Oil \u2013 rub on chest or back\n\nFlu\n\n Oscillo \u2013 works well at reducing symptoms and decreasing recovery time\n\nGrowing Pains \u2013 Calcium \u2013 there is a homeopathic that works, but in general they need raw material for bone growth \u2013 I prefer coral calcium because of the balance of minerals.\n\nAcne \u2013 Clean up diet. When this is not possible, green pills, dandelion and / or probiotics. (I know this is not a preschool issue, but sometimes I like to plant seeds for future reference.)\n\nCaffeine Antidote \u2013 Coffea Cruda \u2013 this is great for getting kids (and me) to sleep after too much tea or soda.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "My Recommendations to Group of Young Mothers", "url": "https://naturalcowgirl.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/my-recommendations-to-group-of-young-mothers/", "description": "This is a handout I gave in a recent talk to a group of mothers of young children.\u00a0 I jotted down these notes based on the issues I remembered when my son was a preschooler.\u00a0 I hope you find it hel\u2026", "article:published_time": "2010-11-11T19:57:54+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2010-11-11T20:04:57+00:00", "site_name": "Margaret's Natural Health Blog", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "tags": ["Acne", "Stress", "Oscillo", "Colloidal Silver", "Insomnia"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://naturalcowgirl.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/my-recommendations-to-group-of-young-mothers/#print", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20My%20Recommendations%20to%20Group%20of%20Young%20Mothers&body=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalcowgirl.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F11%2F11%2Fmy-recommendations-to-group-of-young-mothers%2F&share=email", "https://naturalcowgirl.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/my-recommendations-to-group-of-young-mothers/?share=facebook", "https://naturalcowgirl.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/my-recommendations-to-group-of-young-mothers/?share=twitter"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2010-11-11T19:57:54+00:00"}
