We are excited to have you join us for our #RESEARCHROCKS Discussion today. If this is your first time here, take a few moments to review our previous episodes for many valuable tips and tricks. We have looked at ways to improve your search results, prepare your finds to be shared, and create calls of action for your research projects. Today we will be discussing the jewels from our prior group dig and looking at the many facets of information that can be featured along with a new tool for your toolbox \u2013 THE INFOGRAPHIC METHOD\n\nAn INFOGRAPHIC is a collection of information that is put into a visual graphic image for easier understanding. Now that benefit alone is huge but turning dull information into sharable content quickly with high rates of engagement (aka sharing) and the enhanced knowledge retention and recall (aka remembering) make this method a must have resource in your arsenal.\n\nI have included an example of one I pulled together from a timeline resource on our topic today. We will cover it after our group discussion. But you will now have the ability to convey your message with a more powerful punch using INFOGRAPHICS too!!\n\nDiscussions are a vital component involved in researching. Research is not just reading but also connecting dots to see a bigger picture. Being exposed to new research changes how you view your world \u2013 every time. We recommend getting a pen and paper to write down thoughts you may want to share in the discussion.\n\n\u201cLate 1800s Francis Galton coined the term eugenics. Galton was half-cousin of Charles Darwin. Galton was involved in the fields of genetics, psychology, meteorology, and statistics, and advocated for a selective breeding program for humans.\n\n\u201cEarly 1900s Charles Davenport and Harry Laughlin began a eugenics movement in the U.S.\n\n\u201c1901 John D. Rockefeller founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (RIMR) in Arkansas.\n\n\u201c1907 Indiana was the first state to enact a sterilization law, and by 1935, 32 other states followed suit, which resulted in forced sterilization of 60,000 people in the U.S. by the mid 60s.\n\n\u201c1917 Margaret Sanger founded the journal the \u2018Birth Control Review.\u2019 Some of her articles included:\u201dBirth Control and Racial Betterment\u201d (Feb. 1919), \u201cSome Moral Aspects of Eugenics\u201d (June 1920), \u201cThe Eugenic Conscience\u201d (February 1921), \u201cThe Purpose of Eugenics\u201d (December 1924), \u201cBirth Control and Positive Eugenics\u201d (July 1925) and \u201cBirth Control: The True Eugenics\u201d (August 1928).\n\n\u201c1930 The Rockefeller Foundation began financing the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, and continued to fund them up through 1939, being fully aware of their eugenics experiments.\n\n\u201cThe Rockefellers worked with scientists, WHO, UNFPA, USAID, multiple governments, and others, to create anti-fertility vaccines that would sterilize both men and women on a mass scale, with research evolving into crops as well. \u201cEugenicists under the guise of \u201cscientists\u201d and \u201cphilanthropists\u201d have been running this game for decades. Statistics don\u2019t lie. The timeline paints the picture, the data creates the framework, and the circle of people instrumental in these agendas are quoted in their own words. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret \u2013 they haven\u2019t hidden this \u2013 one only needs to open their eyes. After all, they\u2019ve long since formed their \u201cpopulation control\u201d organizations, and have been telling you their concerns for years now. You just couldn\u2019t imagine that what they meant by \u201ccontrol\u201d was literally altering human physiology and outcomes to serve their eugenics agenda. \u201cLate 1800s Francis Galton coined the term eugenics. Galton was half-cousin of Charles Darwin. Galton was involved in the fields of genetics, psychology, meteorology, and statistics, and advocated for a selective breeding program for humans. \u201cEarly 1900s Charles Davenport and Harry Laughlin began a eugenics movement in the U.S. \u201c1901 John D.

He was also Vice President of the American Eugenics Society. \u201cOther honorees have included Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and Ted Turner, to name a few. \u201c1973 Abortion was made legal by the Supreme Court following Roe v. Wade. Coincidentally, this is also the timeframe in which most states repealed their sterilization laws. \u201c1988 The Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s annual report states that their \u201cpopulation division\u201d was making progress: \u201cIndia\u2019s National Institute of Immunology (in New Delhi) successfully completed the first phase of trials with three versions of an anti-fertility vaccine for women. \u201dThe National Institute of Health (NIH) published the abstract on \u2018Anti-fertility Vaccines\u2019 in 1989. \u201cVaccines are under development for the control of fertility in males and females.\u201d \u201cThe William H. Gates Foundation was formed, later becoming the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, with their goal centered on global immunization.\u201d\n\n2000 The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was formed by Bill Gates, to accelerate the use of underused and new vaccines, increase funding, and shape the vaccine markets.\n\nINFOGRAPHIC RESOURCE: For much more though list of depopulation, eugenic, human experimentation and atrocities: A History Timeline of Population Control\n\n30 Population Control Quotes That Show That The Elite Truly Believe That Humans Are A Plague Upon The Earth\n\nUN Launches Blueprint For The New World Order With The Help Of The Pope: The 2030 Agenda\n\n\u201cUltimately, they hope to centrally plan and strictly regulate virtually everything that we do, and we will be told that it is necessary to \u201csave the planet\u201d.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026what is \u201csustainable development?\u201d\n\nPatrick Wood, an economist and author of \u201cTechnocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation,\u201d says it\u2019s clear the U.N. and its supporters see sustainable development as more than just the way to a cleaner environment. They see it as the vehicle for creating a long-sought new international economic order, or \u201cNew World Order.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s new book traces the modern technocracy movement to Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller and the Trilateral Commission in the early 1970s.\n\nAnd Wood is quite correct. The environment is a perfect vehicle for the elite to use to bring in their version of utopia, because just about every possible form of human activity affects the environment in some way.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, they hope to centrally plan and strictly regulate virtually everything that we do, and we will be told that it is necessary to \u201csave the planet\u201d.\u201d\n\nHOW MIGHT THE SAVE THE EARTH MOVEMENT TIE IN WITH THE AGE OF REASON AND THE GEORGIA GUIDESTONES?\n\n\u201cLenin\u2019s birthday, April 22nd, is still quite popular, albeit officially celebrated only by the now-official communists under Gennady Zyuganov, as well as globally by the duped earth-worshippers who\u2019ve been celebrating it since Lenin\u2019s 100th birthday in 1970 as \u201cEarth Day.\u201d The Day of the Red Army, February 23rd, is also still being celebrated under a slightly changed motto. As is, of course, May 1st, Labour Day, the highday of international communism.\u201d \u201c\u2026capable of withstanding the most catastrophic events, to be set up on some hilltop literally in the middle of nowhere and meant to communicate a \u201dmessage for future generations,\u201d i.e. to instruct the shattered remnants of humanity, who will have survived a future cataclysm, in rebuilding a new society, a better civilisation than the one that nearly destroyed itself, and in finally entering an \u201cAge of Reason.\u201d The allusion apparently was to this 1794 classic of \u201cEnlightened\u201d philosophy (the year in which Robespierre\u2019s \u201cTerreur\u201d reached its horrifying peak in revolutionary France, by the way). Its author, freethinker and radical enemy of religion, Englishman Thomas Paine (1737-1809), was a key player in both the French and American Masonic-Rosicrucian revolutions:\u201d \u201cHowever, \u201cR. C. Christian\u201d rather seems to be a deliberate allusion to the highly secretive Order of the Rosy Cross, an hermetic fraternity interested in alchemy and all sorts of ritual magic including the Kabbalah and formed in 15th-century- respectively re-established in early 17th-century Germany, and to its legendary founder, Frater C.R. resp. Christian Rosenkreutz. Rosicrucianism is an invisible movement rather than an official organisation, although there are to this day several societies that claim to be the genuine continuation of it. Rosicrucians have been frequently assumed as being at the core of international Satanism.\u201d \u201cIn fact, many prominent Freemasons and Theosophists were also Rosicrucians and vice versa. \u201cGood Pope\u201d John XXIII, who in 1962 launched, without necessity, a \u201creform council\u201d known as the Second Vatican Council, that then turned out as a veritable cultural revolution within the Roman Catholic Church, is said by a number of serious researchers, such as Piers Compton, to have been a crypto-communist, member of the Grand Orient de France, and covert Rosicrucian-Satanist!\u201d \u201cAs for the mysterious orderers, no one has ever achieved unequivocally to detect their identity (there have been some speculations, though, whether Ted Turner could have been that ominous Mr. Anonymous).\u201d \u201cJohn Lennon\u2019s dark \u201cmother goddess\u201d of earlier days, Yoko Ono (and weren\u2019t especially the Beatles deeply involved not only in communist and New Age propaganda but even, like most Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll figures, in Satanism?), even came out in 1993 with a song \u201cGeorgia Stone\u201d on a tribute record for the recently deceased composer sharlatan John Cage. Yoko Ono freely praises the monstrosity as \u201ca stirring call to rational thinking, akin to Thomas Paine\u2019s \u2018The Age of Reason\u2019 \u201d, demonstrating how well she understands the symbolism and allusions that go with it.\u201d\n\nDo We Even Have a Population Problem?\n\n\u201cThere is NO overpopulation. We can accommodate millions MORE. The real problem is maldistribution of resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn POPULATION BOOM curious documentary filmmaker Werner Boote travels the globe and examines a stubborn view of the world that has existed for decades.\n\n\u201cBut he sees a completely different question: Who or what is driving this catastrophic vision?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. population growth hit a historic 80-year low last year and the entire world population growth is on a downward spiral, particularly in western countries.\n\n\u201cOn April 29, 2019 Tucker Carlson had Dr. Hagai Levine on his show to discuss the alarming decline in male sperm count in men in the west, which has fallen over 50% in the last 40 years. That is astronomical!\u201d\n\nMost people don\u2019t know about the 2009 meeting of the billionaire club.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft billionaire Bill Gates and nine other American \u201cforeign experts\u201d in engineering and technology have been elected as new members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE)\n\nTogether with David Rockefeller, George Soros, Ted Turner, Warren Buffet, and a small clutch of additional billionaires, Gates formed a cabal they dubbed \u201cThe Good Club,\u201d which seems to be fixated on population control. Its members are uncomfortably comfortable with China\u2019s coercive (and murderous) One Child policy as an answer to population \u201cproblems.\u201d\n\nTed Turner\n\nGiving Focus: United Nations, environment\n\nNet Worth: $2.2 billion\n\nLifetime Giving: $1.3 billion\n\nIn 1997, the man behind Turner Broadcasting and CNN made a historic $1 billion pledge that launched the United Nations Foundation. While the U.N. cannot directly raise money from philanthropists, the U.N. Foundation can\u2014using the funds to support the intergovernmental organization\u2019s peacekeeping, public health and environmental activities across the world. He fulfilled his big U.N. pledge in 2014. Turner, who has donated at least $300 million to other causes including land, water and species conservation through his own foundation, has said his U.N. contribution \u201cis the best investment I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d FORBES\n\nTIP 1 INFOGRAPHIC METHOD: Below is an sample on DEPOPULATION METHODS from our first resource today.
