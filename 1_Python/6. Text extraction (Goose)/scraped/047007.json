Kolakusic directed his message at Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, whom he dubbed as \u201cMrs. 4.5 Billion Doses.\u201d\n\nAccording to the MEP, von der Leyen refused to disclose communications surrounding the EU\u2019s purchase of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to him and other federal lawmakers.\n\n\u201cTen of us MEPs asked her the following question: When will she present to us, the members of the European Parliament, as well as the EU citizens whom she supposedly represents, the communication she had with Pfizer during the procurement of 4.5 billion doses of vaccines at a time when there was absolutely no proof of the effectiveness, and especially not of the harmfulness of that product?\u201d Kolakusic said.\n\n\u201cImagine \u2013 four and a half billion doses for 450 million people. [The U.K.] is no longer with us, so there are quite a few of us. Based on that calculation \u2013 each child, newly born, should receive ten doses of something that no one in the world, except maybe two or three people, knows what it contains.\u201d\n\nKolakusic commented that the deal between Pfizer and von der Leyen was all about \u201csecrets\u201d and \u201cprotected patents,\u201d adding: \u201cDon\u2019t think that any kind of government or European agency knows exactly what is in that product. Nobody knows that, and nobody tells you that.\u201d\n\nHe further pointed out that the COVID-19 vaccine was approved \u201cjust based on the statements of the pharmaceutical companies,\u201d without any medical research to back up the approval.\n\n\u201cTo date, no medical research has been handed over to the members of the EU Parliament\u2019s COVID committee or the European Medicines Agency. How is that possible? We are talking about corruption here,\u201d said Kolakusic.\n\n\u201cThe procurement of 4.5 billion [vaccine doses] with the intention of injecting them into people, without anyone knowing what is inside, is surely the biggest corruption affair in the history of mankind, not only in the history of the EU.\u201d (Related: European Parliament member says EU over-purchase of COVID jabs equates to \u201cbiggest corruption scandal in the history of mankind.\u201d)\n\nThe Croatian MEP, formerly a judge in his home country, earlier compared COVID-19 vaccine makers to members of an \u201cunscrupulous mafia.\u201d\n\nDuring a session of the European Parliament in February 2022, Kolakusic warned his fellow MEPs about the emergence of \u201cpowerful, unscrupulous mafia-pandemic profiteers who are more dangerous than all previous forms of organized crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a mafia that uses the media, instead of weapons, for a fear campaign to sell billions of its products. Over the past year, virtually all mainstream media in Europe and worldwide have been spreading misinformation and publishing falsehoods.\u201d\n\nThe source of the misinformation, according to Kolakusic, is the COVID-19 vaccine makers that aim to sell several billions of their products annually by propagating fear campaigns.\n\n\u201cThere is no end to this fear campaign because they earn tens of billions a year. They are organized, spread fear and influence policymakers.\u201d\n\nKolakusic also pointed his finger at von der Leyen, blaming her COVID-19 policies for dividing citizens and violating their rights.\n\n\u201cFundamental human rights have never been more seriously violated in the past 80 years since Nazism \u2013 freedom to travel, the right to work, health care and the right to ban medical experiments performed on more than 500 million people,\u201d he said, emphasizing that \u201cevery citizen has the right to self-determination.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Croatian MEP also blasted vaccine passports. \u201cThe vaccination certificates that only allow the vaccinated to travel freely \u2013 while spreading the virus just as easily as the unvaccinated \u2013 are insane,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTens of thousands of citizens have died from the side effects of vaccines. Mandatory vaccinations represent the death penalty and will result in the execution of many citizens.\u201d\n\nWatch Croatian MEP Mislav Kolakusic blast the EU\u2019s purchase of COVID-19 vaccine doses below.\n\nThis video is from the Prevent Global Genocide channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nWHO Pandemic Treaty will take away government oversight in the event of another pandemic, German MEP says.\n\nRomanian lawmaker GRILLS Big Pharma executives over lack of accountability for dangerous COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMembers of European Parliament push back hard against vaccine mandates and safety passports.", "opengraph": {"title": "Croatian MEP Kolakusic: EU\u2019s purchase of excess COVID-19 vaccine doses is \u201cbiggest corruption scandal in history\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-10-14-croatia-mep-vaccine-purchase-biggest-corruption-scandal.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "Croatian Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Mislav Kolakusic blasted the European Union\u2019s purchase of excess Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine doses, calling it the biggest corruption scandal in history. \u201cThe purchase of 4.5 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for 450 million EU residents is the biggest corruption scandal in the history of mankind,\u201d he [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.biggovernment.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2022/10/facebook-oped-66.jpg"}, "tags": ["big government", "European Union", "drug cartels", "Big Pharma", "Pfizer", "covid-19", "deception", "corruption", "Ursula von der Leyen", "vaccine", "vaccine wars", "pandemic", "traitors", "pharmaceutical fraud", "conspiracy"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://rairfoundation.com/breaking-mep-calls-eu-covid-vaccine-purchases-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-the-history-of-mankind/", "https://twitter.com/mislavkolakusic/status/1580132343758540800", "http://corruption.news", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-10-14-covid-jab-over-purchase-biggest-corruption-scandal.html", "https://rairfoundation.com/mep-compares-covid-vaccine-makers-to-unscrupulous-mafia-video/", "https://vaccinedeaths.com", "https://www.brighteon.com/08d75876-8b3c-43ad-917a-dbb4eba8d172", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/nuremberg", "https://globalism.news/2022-05-12-who-pandemic-treaty-takes-away-government-involvement.html", "https://bigpharmanews.com/2022-09-09-romanian-lawmaker-grills-big-pharma-execs-vaccines.html", "https://resist.news/2021-11-04-eu-parliament-members-push-back-against-vaccine-mandates.html", "https://genocide.news/2022-02-02-croatian-politician-mandatory-covid-vaccination-death-penalty.html", "https://vaccinedeaths.com/2021-12-03-german-mep-when-will-vaccine-deaths-counted.html", "https://rairfoundation.com/breaking-mep-calls-eu-covid-vaccine-purchases-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-the-history-of-mankind/", "https://twitter.com/mislavkolakusic/status/1580132343758540800", "https://rairfoundation.com/mep-compares-covid-vaccine-makers-to-unscrupulous-mafia-video/", "https://www.brighteon.com/08d75876-8b3c-43ad-917a-dbb4eba8d172", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fbiggovernment%2F2022-10-14-croatia-mep-vaccine-purchase-biggest-corruption-scandal.html&linkname=Croatian%20MEP%20Kolakusic%3A%20EU%E2%80%99s%20purchase%20of%20excess%20COVID-19%20vaccine%20doses%20is%20%E2%80%9Cbiggest%20corruption%20scandal%20in%20history%E2%80%9D", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
