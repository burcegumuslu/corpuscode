These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information; therefore, fact-checking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources.\n\u2022 Overall, we rate Vaccines Revealed a 100% quackery website that promotes dangerous misinformation that can damage the health of people who are sick or avoiding disease.\n\nVaccines Revealed is a news and information website related specifically to the dangers of vaccines. Interestingly the people behind this website are chiropractors, which, as far as I know, have nothing to do with the science of vaccinations. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, they have renamed the website \u201cCovid Edition.\u201d The website also redirects to a new domain in 2020: vrevealed.com.\n\nThe website lacks transparency as they do not offer an about page or disclose ownership or funding.\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nVaccines Revealed does not disclose ownership or how they generate revenue.\n\nIn our past review of this site, they provided dangerous information about vaccines where they say: Just say No to Flu Vaccinations. A recent report from the CDC indicates flu vaccinations have saved up to 40,000 lives in the last 9 years. However, in 2021 they are solely focused on promoting misleading and false information regarding Covid-19 and the associated vaccines.\n\u2022 What Is The Real Risk Of Dying From COVID?\n\u2022 How Will We Really Know That a COVID Vaccine is Safe?\n\u2022 Is there really no treatment for COVID?\n\u2022 How do I know What\u2019s Real? It then links to documentaries and videos from some of the most discredited names in the anti-vax business, such as Robert F Kennedy Jr. (Children\u2019s Health Defense), Del Bigtree (The Highwire), Ben Tapper (Chiropractor), and Mary Holland (Attorney)\u2026absent on this list is an expert on vaccines. They conclude the website by stating: WE ARE NOT CONSPIRACY THEORISTS\u2026 WE ARE FOLLOWING THE FACTS: You are being lied to.\n\n There\u2019s REAL DAMAGE Happening To Real People\u2026\n\n The evidence is OVERWHELMING! If you have to declare you are not conspiracy theorists, that should be a red flag! Overall, we rate Vaccines Revealed a 100% quackery website that promotes dangerous misinformation that can damage the health of people who are sick or avoiding disease. (D.
