Yes, that would be the United States, based on new research (May 4, 2011).\n\nThose demanding scrutiny of vaccine policies have reason to be encouraged. First, the Center for Disease Control has finally agreed to examine data linking vaccines to Tourette syndrome, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as part of a five-year effort. (See plans here).\n\nNow, study results show that when comparing countries around the world, nations requiring the most vaccine doses tend to have the highest infant mortality rates.\n\nThe full article from Human and Experimental Toxicology: \u201cInfant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given: Is there a biochemical or synergistic toxicity?\u201d is available for no charge here.\n\nThe U.S. childhood immunization schedule requires 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year, the most in the world, yet 33 nations have better infant mortality rates.\n\nThe authors say that while the U.S. needs to lower preterm birth rates, it must also inspect correlations between vaccine doses, biochemical or synergistic toxicity, and infant mortality rates, adding \u201call nations\u2014rich and poor, advanced and developing\u2014have an obligation to determine whether their immunization schedules are achieving their desired goals.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Country Requiring the Most Infant Vaccine Doses has the Highest Infant Mortality Rate | ACN Latitudes", "description": "Which country requires the most infant vaccine doses and yet has the highest infant mortality rate?
