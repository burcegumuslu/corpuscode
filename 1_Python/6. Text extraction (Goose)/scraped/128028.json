All in all, the military is expecting around a 40,000-troop deficit in the next couple of years.\n\n\u201cThose figures mean that this year is on track to be the Army\u2019s worst recruiting year in almost 50 years,\u201d reports The Epoch Times.\n\nTo help incentivize more people to join the Army, the military arm is expected to dole out $1 billion for various programs that aim to make becoming a soldier more attractive.\n\nAccording to Maj. Charles Spears of the Combined Arms Center, one major factor in the military\u2019s recruitment deficit is the fact that less than one in four American youth meet the physical fitness requirement necessary to join the military.\n\n\u201cOnly 23 percent of American youth are qualified to serve without a waiver [as] obesity, addiction, medical, and behavioral health are the top disqualifiers for service,\u201d he said.\n\nMany American young people would also rather work in the private sector where they have somewhat more freedom, including the right to not be forcibly vaccinated with Big Pharma drugs.\n\n\u201cSocial media\u2019s virtual public square shapes the values and perceptions of American youth, which is increasingly unfamiliar with the benefits of Army service,\u201d Spears claims.\n\nThe U.S. military has become a joke, and nobody\u2019s laughing\n\nA growing number of Americans is \u201cincreasingly disconnected\u201d from the U.S. military, one reason for which is lack of support for the war machine and its endless nation-building and world policing endeavors.\n\nWhat young person wants to be told that he has to get jabbed with every vaccine on the schedule while dealing with a potentially transgender sergeant? And who would want to serve under an illegitimate buffoon like Joe Biden?\n\n\u201cOftentimes, influencers [such as parents, teachers, and coaches] do not recommend military service,\u201d Spears laments, adding that \u201cthe share of youth who have seriously considered military service is at a historic low of 9 percent.\u201d\n\nSeeing as how the United States has become a bastion of anti-white hatred that is welcoming in illegals as part of a great replacement agenda, it is a wonder that any white person is still willing to serve the war machine at all.\n\nSpears also blames the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) for the lack of interest among American young people to join the military \u2013 though he did confess that there has also been a major change in what the military stands for and the values it upholds.\n\nWhile past military folks were tried-and-true patriots who believed that they were serving a good cause, the military of today has gone \u201cwoke,\u201d further detracting decent, honest, hard-working Americans from wanting to participate in the charade.\n\n\u201cMuch of the country doesn\u2019t love America like it used to,\u201d Spears admits. \u201cAnd with a military no longer upholding the values, the oaths, or the creeds it once did, what kind of new recruits should we expect [to join the Army]?\u201d\n\nThe oath that servicemen must swear to no longer has any meaning, which makes the past allure of the U.S. military obsolete in today\u2019s world.\n\n\u201cFrom a macro perspective, we had a significant breach of trust in the last election,\u201d Spears says, the suggestion being that millions of Americans do not recognize Biden as the legitimate Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\u201cThey (also) happily encourage mandated vaccines, back the transgender issue, and speak out in opposition to the Supreme Court of the United States in regard to Roe v. Wade \u2013 all of which are very political,\u201d he added about today\u2019s perverted and corrupted military environment.\n\nMore stories like this one can be found at Collapse.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Woke U.S. military failing to recruit because nobody wants to defend American degeneracy", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-08-19-military-failing-recruit-nobody-wants-american-degeneracy.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Over the next two years, the United States Army is expecting a huge shortfall in recruitment, which is, in part, the consequence of the military\u2019s rampant \u201cwokeism.\u201d Fiscal year 2022 is expected to be about 10,000 troops short while fiscal year 2023 could reach a shortfall of 28,000 troops.
