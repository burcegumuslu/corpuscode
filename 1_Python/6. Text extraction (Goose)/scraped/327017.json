One of the top leaders of the every-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective cult, Offit is now opposed to Wuhan flu \u201cbooster\u201d shots, recognizing how ineffective they are at fighting off the new mutant variants of the lab-made \u201cgain of function\u201d Fauci flu. What a turn of events this has turned out to be, thanks to the highly ineffective Covid booster stabs. This is the same shill and vaccine orator who once said he could get 10,000 vaccines at once and be just fine.\n\nDr. Paul \u201cCHOP\u201d Offit (nickname comes from his employment at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia), who created the intestine-twisting RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine, that contains two deadly strains of a pig virus called circovirus, suddenly doesn\u2019t support a gene therapy injection that causes auto-immune disorders, vascular clots, myocarditis, and pericarditis. How ironic. Maybe he\u2019s angry he didn\u2019t think of it himself, and that he didn\u2019t patent it himself, so he\u2019s not making a fortune from its sales.\n\n\u201cEvery Child by Two\u201d vaccine proponent Paul Offit is now anti-vax and anti-science because he\u2019s not promoting Covid boosters\n\nMainstream media and the vaccine industrial complex (VIC) are always pinning labels on anyone opposed to getting jabbed with known neurotoxins, mercury, spike proteins, and the like, so now it\u2019s only appropriate to pin those same labels on one of their own, mister Paul Offit himself.\n\nIn 2008, Offit received hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from Big Pharma for pushing the program \u201cEvery Child by Two,\u201d which meant every infant needed to get at least 30 or more toxic jabs before reaching two years of age in order to survive all the world\u2019s infectious diseases, it was deemed. Offit advised the CDC at the time on immunization practices, and now he advises the FDA on the same. Go figure.\n\nNow, for some strange reason (other than the fact that boosters are like death sentences for children, infants, and babies in the womb), Offit has turned \u201canti-vax\u201d and \u201canti-science\u201d regarding the Covid booster stabs.\n\nEven though Dr. Paul Offit once claimed a baby can get 10,000 vaccines at once and be just fine, now he\u2019s opposed to the Covid boosters\n\nWhat gives? If you know Paul Offit\u2019s history of promoting every single deadly jab in the world as \u201csafe and effective,\u201d you may be shaking your head right now as to why he is bucking the jab system and saying the Fauci Flu jabs are useless. This pro-vax freak is a multi-millionaire from crafting, marketing, promoting, and selling deadly vaccines his whole professional career, and now he\u2019s speaking out against spike protein syndrome, saying it\u2019s not good for children\u2019s health?\n\nOffit writes, \u201cOn June 28, 2022, researchers from Pfizer\u2013BioNTech and Moderna presented data on their bivalent vaccines to the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (of which I am a member),\u201d \u2026 \u201cThe results were underwhelming.\u201d He\u2019s calls them \u201cclinically insignificant.\u201d\n\nScientific evidence now reveals that every subsequent booster someone gets renders their immune system WORSE OFF than it was previously. This is similar to people who have full-blown AIDS, so this is basically vaccine-induced AIDS. Wouldn\u2019t that help Offit make more money at CHOP, treating children for all kinds of vaccine-induced trauma, like he does after they get the rotavirus jabs and suffer from twisted intestines and chronic diarrhea?\n\nOffit says the Covid boosters do not work as claimed. In fact, regulators have already determined that based on data, there is \u201cno significant difference in neutralization of any SARS-CoV-2 variant\u201d between the boosted and the non-boosted. Oops.\n\nOffit is still in love with the original mRNA stabs, though, so don\u2019t be fooled by his latest head fake. For most Americans, the damage is done, and according to mRNA \u201ctechnology,\u201d spike protein syndrome will continue indefinitely, as people\u2019s cells are now instructed to continue making the deadly prions and spreading them throughout the vascular system and vital organs, causing turbo cancer, vascular clots, heart problems, and SADS.\n\nBookmark Vaccines.news to your favorite independent websites for updates on experimental gene therapy injections the CDC and fake news claim are \u201csafe and effective\u201d when they\u2019re really dangerous and health-damaging.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vaccine pusher Paul Offit now says boosters are no longer needed, so will he be labeled \u201canti-vax\u201d and \u201canti-science?\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2023-02-17-paul-offit-now-says-covid-boosters-unneeded.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "Pro-vax fanatic Dr. Paul \u201cCHOP\u201d Offit, inventor of one of the world\u2019s most deadly vaccines, the RotaTeq Rotavirus jab, is now anti-vax, according to the dictionary definition of the term.
