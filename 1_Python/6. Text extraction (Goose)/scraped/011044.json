Poor working memory makes it difficult for adults with ADHD to hold information temporarily, which means the milk might end up in the cupboard and the cereal in the laundry room.\n\nIn a recent survey, ADDitude asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the most recent wildly misplaced personal item you\u2019ve rediscovered, and where? Was it funny or frustrating?\u201d Here are some of our favorite answers; share your best lost item story in the Comments section below.\n\n\u201cI was in the airport with my family and I started to panic because I lost track of my phone. I was frantically moving my hand around the seat, looking for it. It was in my other hand.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cI took the TV remote with me to the grocery store in my shirt pocket. The remote was as oblivious as I was.\u201d \u2014 Steve\n\n\u201cI have left my wallet at gas stations or driven off with it on my roof so many times in so many cities that it is now funny when strangers drop it off. One time I didn\u2019t even know it was missing yet!\u201d \u2014 Miranda\n\n[Do You Have a Working Memory Deficit? Take This Test]\n\n\u201cI left a carton of eggs in my mailbox. The mailman must have been surprised.\u201d \u2014 Liz\n\n\u201cI garden almost daily, and find my reading glasses in a pot or in a bed of flowers. Luckily I have 10 pairs from the dollar store.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cI lose my wallet, the remote control, and my glasses several times a day. I always check the laundry and fridge first. I would try to write stuff down if I could find the darn day planner\u2026\u201d \u2014 Donald\n\n\u201cI found our house phone in my car. I had kept talking on it as I left the house, probably thinking it was my cell phone. Eventually the call cut off, so I turned on the radio (assuming they would call me back) and then completely forgot about the conversation. Later in the week I stumbled across the phone in the car and realized what happened. When I tell people about these events, they just look at me like I\u2019m crazy.\u201d \u2014 Kim\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found my cell phone in the freezer and the microwave. I just laugh and keep moving \u2014 it\u2019s a part of who I have always been.\u201d \u2014 Sandra\n\n[Read This Next: \u201cI Can\u2019t Cure Their Forgetfulness. I Can Accept It.\u201d]\n\n\u201cWe have a small remote device to open our garage, which I put in my pocket as I garden. One day, my partner asked where the garage opener was. You know that \u2018brain-rush\u2019 feeling that comes with a flurry of images, like life flashing before your eyes? I tried to calmly think through my actions and soon realized I had zero recollection, so I said (in my best \u2018responsible grown-up voice\u2019), \u2018I buried it, darling.\u2019 A week later, my partner found it in a pile of soil at the bottom of the hill.\u201d \u2014 Jane\n\n\u201cI left my car keys in the closet\u2026 and found them two years after I had traded in the car.\u201d \u2014 Sara\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve put the milk in the cupboard and the cereal in the fridge on multiple occasions.\u201d \u2014 MJ\n\n\u201cI left my phone in the refrigerator last night. I only found it because my watch can ping my phone.\u201d \u2014 Amanda\n\n\u201cI always misplace my phone \u2014 usually at the bottom of my super-messy handbag \u2014 but more times than I\u2019d like to admit, I have searched frantically for my phone when I am actually talking on it.\u201d \u2014 Beth\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always frustrating, but I\u2019ve learned to not get my heart rate up over initially misplacing something. Recently, I took my teen daughter\u2019s vaccine card so she wouldn\u2019t lose it \u2014 I never saw it again, but the clinic kindly gave us another.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cOne time I removed my hearing aids, put them in their case, and into the freezer. After looking behind several major appliances, multiple old suitcases, and bags of chips in a desperate quest to find them, I gave up and made an appointment with the audiologist to get replacements. It was a couple of weeks later that the nicely chilled hearing aids turned up somewhere between the frozen peas and the chicken breasts.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cI once lost my phone for three hours and eventually found it in the fridge. When I told my flatmate he replied \u2018Did you get any cold calls?\u2019\u201d \u2014 Sharon\n\n\u201cRecently, I found a Tupperware of pasta sauce from the week before in my cupboard. The spaghetti made it into the fridge but the sauce container ended up in the cupboard. My husband and I laughed and laughed \u2014 it was that or beat myself up about it and that gets me nowhere.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cDecember is always a busy time with routine changes which makes it more difficult to keep track of everyday items. I find myself offering a cash prize to any child that can find my misplaced items. Two years ago I lost my glasses and we spent weeks looking for them. Then this past year I opened the box with the Christmas decorations and there they were!\u201d \u2014 Sherri\n\n\u201cOne time my husband opened our linen cupboard and found that I had left an empty takeaway cup there. He confronted me about leaving my trash there. I had no idea why I did it so all I could do was laugh until I literally fell over.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cI found my car keys in the deep freezer a couple of days after I lost them. It was kind of funny but frustrating at the same time since we spent days looking for them.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cOnce, while doing an inventory count, I was on a ladder checking the highest shelf in the warehouse for missing items. I didn\u2019t find the items, but I did find a clipboard I had left up there a full 18 months earlier!\u201d \u2014 David\n\n\u201cMy son with ADHD is going to a wilderness adventure camp next month so we bought him hiking boots and other supplies. We got home and unpacked our purchases. He threw the empty bags and boxes into the recycle bin. Two days later \u2014 a day before trash pick-up \u2014 I went to throw something away and saw the brand new boots in the bin.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\u2022 Download: How to Tidy Up Your Home Like a Pro\n\u2022 Read: \u201cI Misplace at Least One Thing a Day.\u201d\n\nSUPPORT ADDITUDE\n\n Thank you for reading ADDitude.
