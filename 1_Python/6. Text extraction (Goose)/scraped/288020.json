However, they were added to the Covid statistics due to having received a positive test within 28 days of their death.\n\nBased on Public Health Scotland data seen in the following chart it would seem the top pre-existing condition of those who\u2019ve died with a positive test result for Covid-19 has been dementia, followed by heart disease and chronic respiratory disease.\n\nWhen you consider that testing was compulsory in hospitals, despite it not being written in law, and they used the PCR test notorious for producing false positives, it\u2019s not hard to see how the Government managed to mix tens of thousands of people who actually died of other causes into the Covid-19 death statistics.\n\nThankfully the NHS data informs us that just 3,832 people actually died OF Covid-19 within 28 days of a positive test result in England hospitals between March 2020 and August 25th 2021.\n\nDozens of freedom of information requests were made to Public Health England (PHE); now known as the UK Health Security AGency (UKHSA) during this period requesting to know how many people have died within 28 days of having a Covid-19 vaccine, but each and every time PHE claimed they did \u201cnot hold the information requested\u201d.\n\nBut after months of trying to conceal the data, the Office for National Statistics published a report which contained figures on deaths by vaccination status.\n\nBut those figures may have actually been published by accident. may have been by accident.\n\nA report published by the ONS on September 13th 2021 misled the public into believing the majority of Covid-19 deaths were occurring among the unvaccinated population. But the date parameters used in their report \u2013 January 2nd 2021 to July 2nd 2021- include a huge swathe of deaths that were suffered during the second alleged wave of Covid-19 in January 2021, when barely anybody was vaccinated.\n\nThe figures contained in the report were supposed to mislead the public into believing Covid-19 vaccination was fantastic at preventing death. But by publishing those figures they accidentally revealed that 30,305 people had died within 21 days of having a Covid-19 vaccine in England between January 2nd and July 2nd 2021.\n\nAs you can see above, 14,265 people died within 21 days of having the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 4,388 people died within 21 days of having the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine whose death allegedly involved Covid-19.\n\nAnother 11,470 people died within 21 days of having their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 182 people died within 21 days of having their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine whose death allegedly involved Covid-19.\n\nTherefore 30,305 people died within 21 days of having the Covid-19 vaccine in England during the first 6 months of 2021.\n\nA further 123,796 people also died 21 days or more after having the Covid-19 vaccine, but it\u2019s impossible to know the exact parameters for the other deaths. But the data does reveal that the Covid-19 vaccinated accounted for 70% of all deaths excluding COVID in the first six months of 2021.\n\nBut what\u2019s most concerning is the revelation that the number of people who died within 21 days of having a Covid-19 vaccine (30,305) in the first 6 months of 2021 was 691% / 8x greater than the number of people who allegedly died of Covid-19 within a period of 18 months (3,832).\n\nSadly, reports published by the UK Government since then, reveal that things only got worse.\n\nBecause the latest dataset published on 21st February 2023, confirms COVID Vaccination increases a person\u2019s risk of death by up to 276%. and that mortality rates per 100,000 are lowest among the unvaccinated.\n\nSee for yourself here.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "8x more people died due to C-19 Vaccination over 6 months than died of COVID-19 over 18 months according to UK GOV.", "url": "https://expose-news.com/2023/03/01/covid-vaccination-8x-deadlier-than-disease/", "description": "Official Government reports confirming eight times more people died due to Covid-19 vaccination within six months of the vaccine rollout than had died of Covid-19 within eighteen months are extreme\u2026", "article:published_time": "2023-03-01T06:59:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-28T19:39:08+00:00", "site_name": "The Expose", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/8x.png?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Latest News"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/COVID-19-total-announced-deaths-03-June-2021-weekly-file.xlsx", "https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/covid19/covid-deaths-21-report-week-32.pdf", "https://expose-news.com/2021/02/05/stop-pcr-test/", "https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/deaths_for_any_reason_within_28_34", "https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/deaths_for_any_reason_within_28_34", "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween2januaryand2july2021", "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsinvolvingcovid19byvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween2januaryand2july2021", "https://expose-news.com/2023/02/26/distracted-bulley-uk-gov-proves-covid-vaccines-kill/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/02/26/distracted-bulley-uk-gov-proves-covid-vaccines-kill/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/2023-april-fundraising-campaign/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/13/april-fundraising-campaign-2023/", "https://expose-news.com/asp-payment-box/?product_id=237456", "https://expose-news.com/asp-payment-box/?product_id=253886", "https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dailyexpose", "https://expose-news.com/donate-via-bank-transfer/", "https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/0e00a4d8-4c4a-43b1-8746-6e477dac325d", "t.me/dailyexpose", "https://gab.com/dailyexpose", "https://gettr.com/user/dailyexposegb", "https://expose-news.com/keep-up-with-the-expose/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/uks-emergency-alert-system-failed/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/uks-emergency-alert-system-failed/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/leaked-new-zealand-health-data/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/leaked-new-zealand-health-data/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/covid-jabs-have-created-millions-of-zombies/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/covid-jabs-have-created-millions-of-zombies/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/75-percent-did-not-die-from-covid/", "https://expose-news.com/2023/04/25/75-percent-did-not-die-from-covid/", "https://t.me/dailyexpose"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-03-01T06:59:00+00:00"}
