And, when the home nations of these manufacturers need missiles urgently themselves, their needs can get in the way of meeting ours [\u2026] \u201cThe deteriorating strategic environment in our region, combined with the heightened understanding of how vulnerable extended global supply chains are, means the current situation has become unacceptable.\u201d\n\nCompanies that could be a potential partners include Raytheon Australia, Lockheed Martin Australia, Kongsberg, and BAE Systems Australia. The partner will need to be suitable to work with the US and have strong links with Australian supply chain businesses.\n\nThe new Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Christian Porter released a National Manufacturing Defence Roadmap on Tuesday, for a 10 year plan for investment.\n\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.
