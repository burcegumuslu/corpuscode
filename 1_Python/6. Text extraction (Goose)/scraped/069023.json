Posted in Latest news\n\nAn opinion piece published by the World Economic Forum lauds how \u201cbillions\u201d of people complied with \u201crestrictions\u201d imposed as a result of lockdown, suggesting they would do the same under the guise of reducing carbon emissions.\n\nThe article is titled \u2018My Carbon\u2019: An approach for inclusive and sustainable cities\u2019 and was written by Mridul Kaushik, Mission Director, Smart Cities Mission, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs of India. [bold, links added]\n\nThe subject of the piece is how to convince people to adopt \u201cpersonal carbon allowance programs\u201d given that such schemes have so far been largely unsuccessful.\n\nHowever, Kaushik notes that improvements in tracking and surveillance technology are helping to overcome \u201cpolitical resistance\u201d against such programs.\n\nWriting that \u201cCOVID-19 was the test of social responsibility,\u201d Kaushik commends how \u201ca huge number of unimaginable restrictions for public health were [sic] adopted by billions of citizens across the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were numerous examples globally of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, mass vaccinations and acceptance of contact-tracing applications for public health, which demonstrated the core of individual social responsibility,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn citing how so many people complied with lockdown mandates, despite overwhelming evidence of the harmful consequences such restrictions had on society, Kaushik implies that they\u2019d behave in a similarly obsequious manner in other areas of life.\n\nSuch conformity would be encouraged via technology, including artificial intelligence, digitization, and \u201csmart home\u201d devices, argues Kaushik.\n\nThe article goes on to call for a social-credit style carbon emissions rationing scheme that would provide \u201cindividual advisories on lower carbon and ethical choices for consumption of product and services.\u201d\n\nNew social norms would also be created to define what \u201ca fair share\u201d of personal emissions represents, and determine \u201cacceptable levels\u201d of personal emissions.\n\nWe previously documented how technocrats are preparing \u201cmandatory\u201d personal carbon allowances that would introduce rationing into every area of your life via an app that would record your travel, heating expenses, and even the food you eat.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "WEF OpEd Extols How Covid Lockdowns Primed Billions For Climate Compliance", "description": "The World Economic Forum is suggesting Covid lockdowns readied the world for CO2 reduction schemes.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wef-oped-extols-how-covid-lockdowns-primed-billions-for-climate-compliance/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2022-09-16T16:46:39+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/covid-lockdown.jpg", "image:width": "1505", "image:height": "1127", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">WEF roadmap.
