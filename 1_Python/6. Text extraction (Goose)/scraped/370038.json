Is your nose dripping like water from a tap? Are you getting itchy and watery eyes and all of this has been there since the last few days or weeks? If yes, than it is probably due to the fact that you are suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis or autumn allergy. This kind of upper respiratory allergy develops due to the increased presence of allergens (allergy causing substances like pollen etc.) in the environment during the months of September to early November. An extension of this kind of allergy occurs in the months of April and May.\n\nAlthough the tendency to develop allergy lies in the body itself (all allergies have a strong genetic angle linked to them), seasonal allergies develop either due to pollens or as a reaction to mold spores .A very promising way of treating this allergy is with Homeopathic medicines .Homeopathy, Not only does it give relief, it also helps in eliminating the disease from the body. Although homeopathic treatment at times can be slightly lengthy but it gives a very lasting cure and does not produce any side-effect like drowsiness and sleepiness.\n\nThe main symptoms produced by seasonal allergy like autumn allergy are- having a constant runny nose which at times drips with a continuous water like discharge , watery and itchy eyes, frequent sneezing, itching in the nose roof of the mouth. Some patients complain of a crawling sensation in the nose. At times cough; pain and pressure in face may also be present. The unpredictable timing of the symptoms is a very troublesome part of this disease. The sneezing can start anytime. The patient may have to wake up in the middle of the night due to sudden sneezing and dripping. Early morning attacks of sneezing are a very common feature of this kind of allergy. Fatigue may also be present in some patients\n\nA great way to get rid of this kind of allergy is to use homeopathic medicines. Although I would not recommend self medication but a brief knowledge about how homeopathy and which medicines work will help you in getting yourself treated from your Homeopath. In allergies, it is our body?s own defense system that starts to overreact to substances like pollen, dust particles, fumes etc which are otherwise harmless to the body. The reaction between the defense cells and the substances like pollen leads to the production of a chemical called as histamine which is responsible for the production of the symptoms that are produced in allergy. Homeopathic medicines work by inducing a similar reaction in the body at a very low grade; this leads to a gradual desensitization of the defense system .Many homeopathic medicines used in this process are made from substances or plants that are known to produce such allergies. Most common example is of plant called Ragweed, which is the very common culprit in allergic rhinitis. Homeopathic medicine Ambrosia is made from this plant and is a top grade homeopathic medicine used for treating respiratory allergy. Other Homeopathic medicines that are very useful in treating autumn allergy are Aralea Racemosa, Allium Cepa, Sabadilla, Histaminum, Galphimia Glauca and Natrum Mur.\n\nDr. Vikas Sharma is a Homeopathic specialist based out of Chandigarh India.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NASAL ALLERGY and HOMEOPATHY - Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "description": "Homeopathic medicines for nasal allergy work by inducing a low-grade reaction in the body that leads to a gradual desensitization of the defense system.", "url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/allergy/nasal-allergy-homeopathy/", "site_name": "Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DrHomeo/292178394174737?", "article:section": "allergy", "article:published_time": "2007-11-05T00:47:21+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-08-16T09:43:58+00:00", "updated_time": "2018-08-16T09:43:58+00:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fallergy%2Fnasal-allergy-homeopathy%2F&t=NASAL%20ALLERGY%20and%20HOMEOPATHY", "#", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fallergy%2Fnasal-allergy-homeopathy%2F&title=NASAL%20ALLERGY%20and%20HOMEOPATHY", "http://www.drhomeo.com/photos/NASALALLERGYHOMEOPATHY_908E/image.png", "http://www.drhomeo.com/photos/NASALALLERGYHOMEOPATHY_908E/image_3.png"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2007-11-05T00:47:21+00:00"}
