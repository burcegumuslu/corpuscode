The newly discovered document comes amid debate over Fauci\u2019s choice to support research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology on \u201ckiller\u201d bat coronaviruses.\n\nThe study, titled \u201cThe Ethics of Encouraging Employees to Get the COVID-19 Vaccination,\u201d (read below) was financed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center and the National Human Genome Research Institute, and included Fauci\u2019s wife, Christine Grady, as one of the authors.\n\nThe report was published in March 2022 in response to efforts by the White House and Democratic Party legislators across the country to make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for federal and state employees.\n\nGrady\u2019s paper focuses on the \u201cethics of encouragement strategies aimed at overcoming vaccine reluctance (which can be due to resistance, hesitance, misinformation, or inertia) to facilitate voluntary employee vaccination.\u201d\n\nGrady and her three co-authors explain why it is \u201cethically acceptable\u201d to \u201csubtly pressure employees to get vaccinated\u201d:\n\nThe study asserts that vaccine mandates might be \u201cethically appropriate\u201d if \u201cclear articulation about the consequences of not complying with the policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that circumstance, employees have a choice between getting vaccinated or accepting the consequences of a choice to remain unvaccinated,\u201d it explains.\n\nOther strategies listed by Grady for increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates within a company include providing \u201ctargeted statistics (such as 75% of the company or unit have been vaccinated) to spur competition or even implicitly embarrass vaccine resistors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere can be social consequences associated with peer communication about vaccination, such as stigma and ostracization of those not vaccinated,\u201d the paper asserts.\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
