As a result, the agency has changed its position on safe levels of exposure.\n\nIn the documents, which the advisory board will review, EPA says the latest scientific data \u201cindicate that negative health effects may occur at much lower levels of exposure to PFOA and PFOS than previously understood and that PFOA is a likely carcinogen.\u201d\n\nFollowing the advisory board\u2019s peer review, the new information will be used to develop enforceable drinking water limits for the two PFAS, which have contaminated water nationwide.\n\n\u201cPFOA and PFOS are highly toxic substances that remain pervasive in the drinking water of millions of Americans,\u201d said David Andrews, Ph.D. a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to worry about increased cancer risk, reproductive harms, or immune system harms from PFOA and PFOS in their tap water,\u201d Andrews added. \u201cToday\u2019s action is an important step towards setting health protective drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS that reflect the latest science finding harm to people.\u201d\n\nPFOA and PFOS are two of the best-studied substances in the family of chemicals known as PFAS. PFOA, created by DuPont, was used to make Teflon, and 3M manufactured PFOS for use in Scotchgard. Both substances were used in a variety of applications for decades before being largely phased out under pressure from the EPA in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long past time for the EPA to act,\u201d said Robert Bilott, PFAS attorney and author. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement confirms what we have known for decades \u2013 that very low levels of PFAS can pose serious health risks, including cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news that the EPA\u2019s decisions finally seem to reflect what the agency knows and has known about the science,\u201d Bilott added.\n\nThe EPA set non-enforceable drinking water advisory levels of 70 parts per trillion, or ppt, for the two chemicals individually or combined in 2016. EWG and other leading scientific organizations have long criticized those limits as inadequate and argued for a 1 ppt limit.\n\nEWG researchers have estimated that more than 200 million people in the U.S. are exposed to PFAS in their drinking water, creating potential health risks.\n\nThe new white papers from the EPA bolster calls from EWG and others for much stricter regulation of all PFAS. To protect the health of people, communities and the environment, PFAS should not be regulated one by one but as a class.\n\nTreating PFAS as a class and ending non-essential uses could help avoid \u201cregrettable substitution\u201d \u2013 replacing one toxic chemical for another that may be just as hazardous.\n\nIn October, the EPA published a toxicity assessment for the PFAS chemical GenX with a reference dose \u2013 the amount a person can ingest over a lifetime without suffering health harms \u2013 25 times lower than stated in an earlier version of the review, from 2018.\n\nThe EPA says the updated stricter value, which aims to better protect public health, is in large part due to ongoing data gaps about the hazards of GenX.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.
