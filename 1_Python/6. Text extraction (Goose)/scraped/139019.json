She\u2019s made it her job: As the science communications lead at The COVID Tracking Project, which provides the most complete data we have in the United States on COVID-19 testing, cases, hospitalizations, and outcomes, Rivera talks regularly about how we can make informed decisions and manage risks. She wants us all to be asking questions, and she discusses the biggest ones every Friday on Instagram. When an outlet or group manipulates data to tell a misleading narrative or seeds misinformation about the virus or vaccines, Rivera dispels it with solid and complete data. Which makes her the first person we asked to interview when we wanted to know: What\u2019s the state of the pandemic now, and what\u2019s next?\n\nHow would you say the pandemic is different now from when the WHO first declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020? The pandemic has changed since March, but it\u2019s also still the same in many ways. It\u2019s changed in the sense that we are better equipped to respond to COVID-19 cases. We are caring for patients better in hospitals and increasing positive outcomes in hospitalized cases. We\u2019re further along in vaccine development, too. It has not changed in the sense that we are still in the first wave of this pandemic. For a wave to end and another to begin, there must be a significant low point between surges. We haven\u2019t had that. If you look at the case count data, the United States is trending like a wave that\u2019s fluctuating, and we\u2019re in the third increased fluctuation. In the US, our death numbers have never returned to a normal baseline rate between surges as they have in many other countries. We\u2019re in this third surge at a time when we can expect viral respiratory infections to grow in prevalence because more people are indoors and more people are congregating because of the holidays. It\u2019s the perfect storm for things to go really badly.\n\nWhat have the last nine months taught us about the virus itself and how we can best protect ourselves and our communities? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel virus. We have not seen it before. So even though we are nine months into this pandemic, there are still a lot of unknowns. And because of that, we can\u2019t make any long-term conclusions about immunity. We can\u2019t even make any long-term conclusions about recovery. Recovery: We don\u2019t know what the long-term effects of this disease are. And that\u2019s one of the most confounding and frightening factors of this pandemic. Time is the only way we will be able to determine what it looks like to be a fully recovered COVID-19 patient and whether there are any residual effects. Mutations: We know that the virus is mutating at a very slow rate. It\u2019s not changing a lot. That\u2019s good: Potential vaccines are not going to be outpaced by any viral mutation. Mutations have gotten a bad rap because you get these Hollywood images of things getting completely out of control. Really, mutations are an incredibly normal and expected process in how viruses replicate. A great way to think about mutations in viruses is that they\u2019re like typos: Many times, you\u2019re typing fast and a typo changes the spelling of a word a little bit, but it doesn\u2019t dramatically change the meaning of the sentence. The same is true in a virus: A slight mutation during replication doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the virus changes in a meaningful way. \u201cApart from public health mitigation efforts, we are dependent on a vaccine to prevent infections.\u201d Immunity and reinfection: Based on the data we have, we can presume that it\u2019s pretty unlikely somebody would get reinfected with the virus within ninety days of their first infection, but we have seen cases of reinfection. They are very few and far between, but reinfection is not impossible. The reason it isn\u2019t impossible is because there is no blanket post-infection situation. Not everybody\u2019s immune response is the same. Some people may not develop long-lasting antibodies, and they will be in a position of vulnerability. Some people may develop some antibodies and still get reinfected. Also, antibodies aren\u2019t the only measurement of an immune response. We have to consider T cell and B cell responses as well, which can vary. Here is the difference with vaccination: Vaccines tend to produce robust long-term immune responses. The only way to establish herd immunity is through vaccination. It\u2019s entirely inappropriate to be using the term \u201cherd immunity\u201d outside of a vaccination campaign.\n\nWhy should people get a vaccine when one becomes available to them? This is a novel virus, and we cannot rely on any current medications to prevent the disease absolutely. It\u2019s a virus; you can\u2019t give it antibiotics. We have no other prophylaxis. Apart from public health mitigation efforts, we are dependent on a vaccine to prevent infections. It\u2019s important that everybody gets the vaccine in order to establish herd immunity. Also: Our regulatory system is incredibly robust. Our standards for safety and efficacy are excellent, and they have not been sacrificed for the purpose of expedience. Full stop. \u201cIf multiple vaccines are available, it will be because the FDA has determined that each of them is safe and effective for use.\u201d What\u2019s happened that\u2019s made vaccine development go faster is that we\u2019ve created a much more efficient system that\u2019s cut through a lot of unnecessary red tape. We\u2019ve had unprecedented global cooperation, vaccine trials have been generously financed to prevent delays in advancing through the clinical phases, and we weren\u2019t starting from scratch. We had years of research and early data from SARS and even influenza. So in many ways, we had a running start. That\u2019s why this has been moving so fast compared to a normal vaccine development process. That is encouraging: It shows us that our government is valuing science and prioritizing doing this in a way that can help people in a public health emergency as soon as possible.\n\nWhen we have a vaccine, what comes next? A vaccine will not be a panacea. It will not solve all our problems and make everything go back to normal immediately. There are a number of factors that need to be considered when we\u2019re thinking about the vaccine and the end of the pandemic.\n\u2022 1. If, in an ideal scenario, we get a vaccine approved by the end of this year and prioritize distribution to populations that are at high risk\u2014frontline health care workers, older people, people who live in long-term care facilities, people with comorbidities that put them at a risk for severe outcomes\u2014followed by good distribution to the general public, that puts us at next spring or early summer at the earliest that we would have an adequately immunized population. The pandemic doesn\u2019t immediately end when the vaccine is approved.\n\u2022 2. The vaccines that are at the front of the race so far seem to be two-dose vaccines. Think about the logistics: We\u2019re talking about everybody getting the first dose of the vaccine, going home\u2014still exercising caution through mask wearing and physical distancing\u2014and then four weeks later going back for the second dose. All of that has to go smoothly.\n\u2022 3. When we\u2019re talking about good vaccine distribution, remember that good distribution requires the majority of people (somewhere around 70 percent) to get the vaccine. From the surveys we have so far, up to 40 percent of people are already planning to opt out of a vaccine that hasn\u2019t yet become available and hasn\u2019t even had a chance to be approved by the FDA. That vaccine hesitancy is directly connected to the incredible amount of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines\u2014and about vaccines in general\u2014that is persistent in the US. So far, these vaccines have proven to be effective at preventing severe illness. But it\u2019s still possible that people could get mild or asymptomatic infections and potentially transmit it to others. We will likely be wearing masks and practicing physical distancing well into 2021 as we work toward decreasing disease transmission and increasing vaccination. Only then can we start to ease up on some of the public health mitigation efforts.\n\nWho is lower on the list for vaccine eligibility? Right now, it\u2019s probably children. Children are still not at the greatest risk for severe disease, which is informing the prioritization of who gets the vaccine and in what order. (\u201cChildren\u201d technically means anyone under eighteen. Pediatric data is so complicated: Often, it\u2019s not stratified by age group. So when you\u2019re looking at pediatric cases of COVID-19, sometimes the age grouping is zero to seventeen, which makes it difficult to give specific recommendations for schools and families. High school students tend to fare very similarly to adults, but we\u2019ve definitely seen severe outcomes in children and young adults.) Before we are able to vaccinate children, we need safety and efficacy data to inform that decision. We haven\u2019t yet tested any pediatric COVID-19 vaccines, so we don\u2019t have clinical data on COVID-19 vaccine outcomes in children. On December 2, Moderna listed its pediatric vaccine clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov. It hasn\u2019t started enrollment, but I\u2019m excited to see that the process has started. These pediatric trials are a great next step.\n\nWhat do we need to know about our health care infrastructure right now? The pandemic is stressing the US health care system in a way that the system hasn\u2019t been stressed before. Right now, all eyes are on health care infrastructure: We cannot risk it straining or, god forbid, collapsing. This goes back to early in the pandemic when we were talking about flattening the curve. We can\u2019t expect patients to have the good outcomes that I was talking about earlier if we don\u2019t have enough beds, ventilators, or doctors\u2014or enough PPE to protect the people who need to go see patients. We\u2019re dealing with serious personnel shortages in hospitals. That is terrifying. Hospitals are filling up and running out of the staff they need to take care of the patients. I\u2019ve heard reports of nurses being flown in from New Orleans to help alleviate the burdens in Midwest hospitals. It\u2019s an extremely dangerous thing when your staff is not large enough to deal with surging admissions or when staff themselves are getting sick and dying. There are a number of states, like North Dakota, that are having health care workers who are COVID-positive but asymptomatic continue to work. That\u2019s the situation we\u2019re in: We can\u2019t risk being short-staffed, but now asymptomatic health care workers who can and do spread the virus to others are being asked to continue working.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19 Immunity, Vaccines, and What Comes Next | goop", "description": "Infectious disease epidemiologist Jessica Malaty Rivera, MS, wants us all to understand the novel coronavirus.
