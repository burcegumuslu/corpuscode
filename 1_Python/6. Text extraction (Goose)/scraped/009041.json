The company has been putting employees who claim religious exemptions to forced vaccination on unpaid leave.\n\n\u201cA U.S. judge in Texas on Tuesday temporarily restrained United Airlines from placing any employee on unpaid leave who receive religious exemptions from the company for COVID-19 vaccinations until Oct. 26.,\u2019 Reuters reported. \u201cThe Judge also temporarily restrained the airline from denying any late requests for religious or medical accommodations.\u201d\n\nIn September, United Airlines employees sued the company over its pre-emptive issuance of an employee mandate ahead of the Biden administration\u2019s formal issuance of a federal vaccine mandate.\n\n\u201cSix United Airlines employees filed a federal lawsuit against the company this week seeking to block a COVID-19 vaccine mandate from going into effect,\u201d the Hill reported. \u201cThe complaint, filed Tuesday in a Texas federal court, alleges that the company discriminated against employees who requested religious or medical accommodations.\u201d\n\nThe class action lawsuit, led by United Airlines captain David Sambrano, a North Texas resident, was reported by The Texan.\n\n\u201cThe complaint, filed on September 21, asks for an injunction against United Airlines that would prevent them from terminating or placing on unpaid leave any employee who has a basis for seeking a religious or medical exemption,\u201d the Texan reported on Monday. \u201cThe injunction hearing is currently set for October 13 at 9:30 a.m. in the U.S. District Court for the North District of Texas, Fort Worth Division, where Judge Mark Pittman presides.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnited has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit which is also set for a hearing on the same day at 8:30 a.m.,\u201d the report added.\n\nWhile Texas Governor Greg Abbott has issued an executive order that bars enforcement of any vaccine mandate in the state, including those issued by private employers, major airline carriers are vowing to defy the order.\n\nAmerican and Southwest airlines say they will continue implementing vaccine mandate despite Texas\u2019 move, Politico reported on Tuesday. Southwest also issued a statement on the matter.\n\n\u201cFederal action supersedes any state mandate or law, and we would be expected to comply with the President\u2019s Order to remain compliant as a federal contractor,\u201d Southwest said.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
