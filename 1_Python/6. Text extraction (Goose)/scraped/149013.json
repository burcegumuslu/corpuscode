But, near infrared lamp saunas are an amazing detoxification method for the human body. And while people use them during the winter to keep away the common cold, help with their lack of energy, brain fog, or issues from a chronic disease or condition, they are also useful for cancer treatment and prevention.\n\nDr. William Pawluk has stated that we have 100 million cancer cells in our bodies at any given time and whether it turns into a tumor or not is determined by our immune system\u2019s ability to kill the cancerous cell before it multiplies and possibly becomes carcinogenic. In a healthy individual with a robust immune system, this process happens often and naturally.\n\nSo, when the body is overwhelmed by heavy metals, chemicals, chronic infections, fungus and parasites, and then is further exacerbated by nutritional deficiencies (which everyone has to some degree) the immune system simply doesn\u2019t have the energy or resources to kill these mutated cells any longer. When these mutated cells are allowed to grow unabated, because the immune system is dealing with so many other issues, cancer happens. BUT, it can be avoided.\n\n\u201cNear infrared sauna therapy resolves all burdens to the immune system, directly and indirectly preventing and healing cancer as a result. Many viruses, bacteria, parasites and tumor cells have poor tolerance to heat compared to normal healthy cells and are easily killed with near infrared saunas. It takes 1-3 years of daily sauna use to rid your body of the bulk of heavy metals, chemicals and chronic infections built up over your lifetime. And after this period of intense sauna therapy, one must continue to use a sauna twice a week to rid the body of new environmental onslaughts. Near infrared lamp saunas should be part of any cancer treatment protocol, as they can aid in tumor shrinkage. \u201c\n\nMore from the article:\n\nOther benefits of Near Infrared Saunas:\n\nDetox Heavy Metals: such as lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, aluminum, nickel and many others. These metals accumulate in our bodies causing any imaginable health condition, symptom, and disease, including cancer.\n\nDetox Industrial Chemicals: one hundred thousand chemicals have been unleashed into our environment in the form of dumping and use in manufacturing. \u201cAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a person has 700 chemicals on average in their body, including rocket fuel and pesticides, with the most plentiful being phthalates, found in perfumed and colored personal care products. One can easily sweat these chemicals out of the body\u201d, reports Live to 100.\n\nControl Yeasts, Mold, and Fungi: these infections often go underdiagnosed, can cause or contribute to a wide range of health conditions and can cause all kinds of vague symptoms.\n\nKill Parasites: parasites can be found in the brain and other tissues of the body. These little animals are opportunistic and can easily hide in bodies weakened by other chronic infections, heavy metal toxicity, and nutritional deficiencies. And most parasites have no tests for their detection though even when they are detected, can be very resistant to treatment.\n\nFurther, \u201cparasites can be incredibly frustrating because any parasites you kill have laid eggs, which hatch in a few weeks and the cycle begins again. Treatment must be consistent and ongoing. Parasites are very intolerant to heat. Consistent near infrared sauna therapy is an ideal parasite treatment because it kills the parasites, the recurring parasite hatchlings and detoxes all the infections weakening the host \u2013 you.\u201d\n\nRadiation Poisoning: radiation causes cancer but one of the best ways to destroy cells that contain radiation is with an infrared sauna. These weaker cells can be safely and easily destroyed and prevent any cancers they may have eventually caused.\n\nSkin Rejuvenation: our skin is the largest eliminative organ of the body and sauna slowly restores elimination (which in most people is inactive, congested and toxic) through the skin. \u201cInfrared saunas improve skin health in many ways. They shuttle blood to the skin\u2019s surface, bringing oxygen and nutrients. DNA synthesis of fibroblasts, which affects the elasticity of skin, increased five-fold with infrared use. The result is younger-looking, more beautiful skin. Congestion, little bumps, roughness and other skin conditions clear with infrared sauna use\u201d, reports the article.\n\nEnhanced Sweating: the sweating process gently and safely helps eliminate heavy metals and toxic chemicals. In fact, medical studies demonstrate that most toxins can be eliminated through the skin, relieving some burden on the kidneys and liver.\n\nExercise benefits: saunas provide many of the benefits of exercise (using less energy), too. \u201cThese include enhanced circulation and oxidation of the tissues. Saunas are most helpful for cardiovascular rehabilitation because they lower elevated blood pressure and improve the elasticity of the arteries \u2013 just like exercise.\u201d\n\nFever Therapy (hyperthermia) for Infections: raising body temperature powerfully assists the body in killing bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Common sites of infections are the sinuses, ears, eyes, bladder, throat and intestines. And for those who have a low body temperature and, ridding themselves of chronic infection can be difficult, enter the sauna!\n\nCoincidentally, many people have a low body temperature because their thyroid, which controls body temperature, is not functioning properly- due to heavy metal and chemical toxicity- again, problem solved in the sauna. Additionally, Hashimoto\u2019s, which causes most thyroid dysfunction, is simply an infection of the thyroid, which clears up with sauna use. As the thyroid is healed, body temperature will increase naturally.\n\nTumors and Mutated Cells: from the article, \u201cHyperthermia helps kill all types of abnormal cells \u2013 cells that contain radioactive minerals, chemical toxins, toxic metals and other defective cells. Tumors, for example, tolerate heat poorly. Raising body temperature hastens their death.\u201d\n\nInhibiting the Sympathetic Nervous System: most of us life with an activated sympathetic nervous system\u2013 stressed out in fight or flight mode. However, detoxification and digestion can only occur when the parasympathetic nervous system is activated. An infrared sauna assists the body into a parasympathetic state, allowing detoxification to occur.\n\nEnhanced Immunity: an infrared sauna enhances white blood cell function, which increases immune response and the elimination of foreign pathogens and cellular waste products. It also removes accumulated toxins by improving lymph circulation. A 30-minute infrared sauna session causes a temporary 3\u00b0 increase in body temperature and this increase has been shown to stimulate white blood cells.\n\nOxygenating and Hydrating the Cells and Organs: near infrared is an antioxidant nutrient, activates the cells, supports metabolic processes and decouples toxins from water molecules.\n\nWound Healing: physicians from the Medical College of Wisconsin and NASA found that near infrared light significantly promotes faster cell regeneration, wound healing and human tissue growth; human cell growth increased by 155%-171% in some cases and wound size decreased by 36%.\n\nPain Relief: penetrating heat from infrared saunas reduces pain in joints and muscles by reducing inflammation and increasing circulation to areas of discomfort. Infrared saunas have also been shown to significantly increase range of flexibility.\n\nReduced Blood Pressure: medical researchers from Germany concluded one session in an infrared sauna, for over 1 hour, can have significant reduction of blood pressure thanks to persistent peripheral vessel dilation; blood viscosity was also improved.\n\nInexpensive: near infrared lamp saunas are inexpensive to purchase and run. You can buy a single bulb or create a complete home sauna with three bulbs for $250 or less, using 250-watt red infrared bulbs you can buy at any hardware store or online.\n\nIncreased Detoxification Effects: near infrared saunas shorten the chains of polluted water molecules and as that happens, toxins like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide are expelled.\n\nDeeper Tissue Penetration: near infrared saunas give you deeper tissue penetration than far infrared saunas and therefore, detoxification. They penetrate up to 3 inches (7.6cm) into the body, while a far infrared sauna only penetrates about 1.5 inches (3.8cm).\n\nEnhanced Effect on DNA: the greater the intensity of near infrared lamps, the deeper the penetration of their rays to increase the death of mutated cells (which can eventually turn into cancer).\n\nCirculation: near infrared increases circulation more effectively than far infrared sauna. When the bulbs are only on one side of the sauna, you are able to rotate every few minutes which shunts blood from one side of the body to another, vigorously enhancing circulation.\n\nColor Therapy: the red bulbs used in near infrared emit red, orange and yellow light, which provides stimulating color therapy. More from the article, \u201cThese particular frequencies draw energy downward in the body (from your overworked brain) and assist the digestive and eliminative organs. They also nourish the adrenal glands, liver and kidneys according to traditional color therapies. Sauna researcher, Dr. C. S. Enwemeka wrote, \u201c[Color therapy] includes the ability to accelerate inflammation, promote fibroblast proliferation, enhance chondroplasia, upregulates the synthesis of type I and type III procollagen mRNA, quicken bone repair and remodeling, foster revascularization of wounds and overall accelerate tissue repair in experimental and clinical models.\u201d\n\nFocused Healing: a single near infrared bulb can be focused to heal an isolated injury, infection or health issue. Conditions that benefit from the intense, focused light of a single bulb include rashes, joint pain, muscle strains, acne, boils, conditions of the sinuses and infections and many others.\n\nShine the bulb on the area in need of healing, using the near infrared lamp for five to fifteen minutes, five to ten times per day. Allow the lamp to heat the area as much as is tolerable. Be sure to never shine the lamp for more than five minutes at a time at your head. Avoid using the lamp within 24 hours of an injury. Reddening of the skin is normal and indicates blood being drawn to the area \u2013 exactly what you want to speed healing.\n\nNear infrared saunas are an amazing part of a cancer protocol with the power to heal hundreds of health conditions and diseases and one you should incorporate into your health arsenal. You have the power to fight for your health.
