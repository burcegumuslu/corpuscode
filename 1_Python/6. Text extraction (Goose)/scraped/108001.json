Newsom vetoes California bill to track and report toxic \u2018forever chemicals\u2019", "cleaned_text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 On Thursday, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have required collection and reporting of information on products and substances sold or brought into the state containing the toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d known as PFAS.\n\n\u201cWe are troubled that Gov. Newsom would veto legislation that would finally identify the PFAS coming into the state,\u201d said Bill Allayaud, California director of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.\n\n\u201cHow will the state prevent and clean up the contamination when we don\u2019t know where these toxic PFAS come from? Without this information, we can\u2019t take meaningful steps toward protecting the health of Californians and our environment in the long-term,\u201d said Allayaud.\n\nAssemblymember Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) authored the legislation, A.B. 2247, with state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) and Assemblymember Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) as coauthors.\n\nThe law would have given regulators the tools to find out how many PFAS enter and are sold in California, and in what form.\n\n\u201cState and local governments, water treatment services and businesses will continue to be in the dark about the various sources of PFAS,\u201d said Susan Little, EWG\u2019s senior advocate for government affairs.\n\n\u201cThe California\u2019s sanitation and water agencies are struggling to clean up PFAS. They need to understand where the chemicals are coming from in order to reduce their harmful effects. We\u2019re disappointed Gov. Newsom vetoed this bill,\u201d said Little.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that PFAS are polluting our drinking water systems and harming some of our most vulnerable communities,\u201d she said.\n\nAllayaud added, \u201cLooking at the governor\u2019s veto message, it is particularly disappointing that he pointed to some future action by U.S. EPA as to why California does not need to act now, instead of setting the pace. And he pointed to vague possible costs to state agencies. But this is a failure to acknowledge the costs of PFAS to public health, including pollution of drinking water supplies.\u201d\n\nA broad coalition supported the bill, including all the state\u2019s sanitation and water agencies, cities, counties and special districts, and dozens of clean water and public health advocates, including EWG.\n\nOn Thursday, Newsom signed into law the PFAS-Free Beauty Act, which bans the chemicals from being sold in cosmetics in the state.\n\nPFAS are among the most persistent toxic compounds in existence, contaminating everything from drinking water to food. Because of their grease-, stain- and water-resistant qualities, they are used widely in consumer products, such as food packaging, personal care products and textiles, as well as microchips and other components produced and used by Silicon Valley.\n\nPFAS are found in the blood of virtually everyone, including newborn babies. Very low doses of PFAS have been linked to suppression of the immune system, including reduced vaccine efficacy. These chemicals harm development and the reproductive system, such as reduced birth weight and impacts on fertility; increased risk of certain cancers; and affect metabolism, such as changes in cholesterol and weight gain.\n\nDecades of heavy PFAS use have resulted in contamination of water, soil and animals in the farthest corners of the world.\n\n\u201cIt is long past time we turned off the tap on PFAS pollution,\u201d said Melanie Benesh, EWG vice president of government affairs. \u201cTo do that, we must first learn where this contamination is coming from. Then we can work to prevent more PFAS from getting into our water, food and air.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.
