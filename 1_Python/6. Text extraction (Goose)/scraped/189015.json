The new \u201creproductive health clinic\u201d will be called \u201cThe Samuel Alito\u2019s Mom\u2019s Satanic Abortion Clinic.\u201d\n\nThe group is directing its ire at Supreme Court Justice Alito for being the primary author of the court\u2019s majority opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade, which made abortion a federally guaranteed right in the United States for nearly 50 years. (Related: Biden\u2019s Health Department mulls declaring public health emergency on abortion, claiming it\u2019s an emergency to NOT kill babies.)\n\n\u201cIn 1950, Samuel Alito\u2019s mother did not have options and look what happened,\u201d said Malcolm Jarry, co-founder of the Satanic Temple, in a press release. \u201cThe clinic\u2019s name serves to remind people just how important it is to have the right to control one\u2019s body and the potential ramifications of losing that right.\u201d\n\nAccording to the organization, anybody in New Mexico will be able to access online medical services, including confidential telehealth screenings and virtual appointments. These will result in prescriptions being sent \u201cto the clinic\u2019s pharmacy partner, who will mail the [abortion] medications in a discreet package.\u201d\n\nThe consultations will be free, provided that the women agree to conduct the \u201cReligious Abortion Ritual.\u201d The fees for the anonymous pharmacy are expected to cost around $90.\n\nTST Health, the Satanic Temple\u2019s \u201creligious medical services arm,\u201d said it will have licensed medical staff available for patient questions and has a 24-hour on-call patient hotline.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you live, if you are in the state of New Mexico during your video consultation and when you perform your abortion ritual, you will have abided by the law,\u201d the Satanic Temple said on its \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d page.\n\nSatanic Temple claims abortions are essential to its religious practices and protected by freedom of religion laws\n\nIn New Mexico, abortion is legal up to the point of birth, except in certain municipalities like the small cities of Clovis and Hobbs that have passed local ordinances restricting abortion. The Satanic Temple\u2019s abortion clinic is seen as an attempt to counter any restrictions on abortion in the state.\n\nThe Satanic Temple has previously stated that, under the First Amendment, as well as federal and state laws protecting freedom of religion, the organization\u2019s \u201cabortion ritual\u201d is an essential part of its religious practice and is therefore protected against any restrictions and bans on abortion.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has officially recognized the Satanic Temple as a religious organization, granting it nonprofit tax-exempt status.\n\n\u201c[The Satanic Temple] is proud to expand reproductive options for our members. This is just the beginning,\u201d said Erin Helian, executive director of campaign organizations for the group. \u201cWe will remain steadfast as we continue the fight to uphold reproductive justice in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis should be a wake-up call for all New Mexicans, but especially Christians and all those who voted for pro-abortion Democrats who have made New Mexico a welcoming state for abortion \u2013 and now for \u2018ritual abortion,'\u201d said Elisa Martinez, founder and executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for Life. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s just another example of an out-of-state operation finding safe haven here in New Mexico\u2019s extreme abortion-to-full-term climate.\u201d\n\nEthel Maharg, executive director of Right to Life in New Mexico said the Satanic Temple\u2019s plan is \u201cjust an egregious thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to make it a religious right so that they can use, I guess, the First Amendment right to practice \u2013 but that\u2019s different, freedom of speech and religion,\u201d she said.\n\nLearn more about abortion in the U.S. at Abortions.news.\n\nWatch this report from EWTN\u2018s \u201cNews Nightly\u201d about the Satanic Temple\u2019s attempts to open abortion clinics to provide \u201creligious abortion\u201d and \u201cabortion ritual\u201d care.\n\nThis video is from the Thrive Time Show channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nJudicial Watch sues HHS for ignoring FOIA request to reveal info about government use of human fetal tissue.\n\nWalgreens, CVS to sell ABORTION PILLS in states where abortion is still legal.\n\n$1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill contains \u201csinister\u201d depopulation provisions: $575M to be spent on abortions in areas with high population growth.", "opengraph": {"title": "Satanic Temple to open free abortion clinic in New Mexico", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2023-02-08-satanic-temple-free-abortion-clinic-new-mexico.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "The Satanic Temple will open a free abortion clinic in New Mexico that will offer prescriptions for drugs that cause abortion.
