The FDA asked the Court for permission to only be required to produce at a rate of 500 pages per month, which would have taken over 75 years to produce all the documents.\n\nI am pleased to report that a federal judge soundly rejected the FDA\u2019s request and ordered the FDA to produce all the data at a clip of 55,000 pages per month!\n\nThis is a great win for transparency and removes one of the strangleholds federal \u201chealth\u201d authorities have had on the data needed for independent scientists to offer solutions and address serious issues with the current vaccine program \u2013 issues which include waning immunity, variants evading vaccine immunity, and, as the CDC has confirmed, that the vaccines do not prevent transmission.\n\nNo person should ever be coerced to engage in an unwanted medical procedure. And while it is bad enough the government violated this basic liberty right by mandating the Covid-19 vaccine, the government also wanted to hide the data by waiting to fully produce what it relied upon to license this product until almost every American alive today is dead. That form of governance is destructive to liberty and antithetical to the openness required in a democratic society.\n\nIn ordering the release of the documents in a timely manner, the Judge recognized that the release of this data is of paramount public importance and should be one of the FDA\u2019s highest priorities. He then aptly quoted James Madison as saying a \u201cpopular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy\u201d and John F. Kennedy as explaining that a \u201cnation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nThe following is the full text of the Judge\u2019s order, a copy of which is also available here.\n\nThis case involves the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d). Specifically, at issue is Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request seeking \u201c[a]ll data and information for the Pfizer Vaccine enumerated in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.51(e) with the exception of publicly available reports on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System\u201d from the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). See ECF No. 1. As has become standard, the Parties failed to agree to a mutually acceptable production schedule; instead, they submitted dueling production schedules for this Court\u2019s consideration. Accordingly, the Court held a conference with the Parties to determine an appropriate production schedule.[1] See ECF Nos. 21, 34.\n\n\u201cOpen government is fundamentally an American issue\u201d \u2013 it is neither a Republican nor a Democrat issue.[2] As James Madison wrote, \u201c[a] popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps, both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.\u201d[3] John F. Kennedy likewise recognized that \u201ca nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d[4] And, particularly appropriate in this case, John McCain (correctly) noted that \u201c[e]xcessive administrative secrecy . . . feeds conspiracy theories and reduces the public\u2019s confidence in the government.\u201d[5]\n\nEchoing these sentiments, \u201c[t]he basic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an informed citizenry, [which is] vital to the functioning of a democratic society.\u201d NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1977). \u201cFOIA was [therefore] enacted to \u2018pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\u2019\u201d Batton v. Evers, 598 F.3d 169, 175 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976)). And \u201cCongress has long recognized that \u2018information is often useful only if it is timely\u2019 and that, therefore \u2018excessive delay by the agency in its response is often tantamount to denial.\u2019\u201d Open Soc\u2019y Just. Initiative v. CIA, 399 F. Supp. 3d 161, 165 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting H.R. REP. NO. 93-876, at 6271 (1974)). When needed, a court \u201cmay use its equitable powers to require an agency to process documents according to a court-imposed timeline.\u201d Clemente v. FBI, 71 F. Supp. 3d 262, 269 (D.D.C. 2014).\n\nHere, the Court recognizes the \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d challenges that this FOIA request may present to the FDA. See generally ECF Nos. 23, 30, 34. But, as expressed at the scheduling conference, there may not be a \u201cmore important issue at the Food and Drug Administration . . . than the pandemic, the Pfizer vaccine, getting every American vaccinated, [and] making sure that the American public is assured that this was not [] rush[ed] on behalf of the United States . . . .\u201d ECF No. 34 at 46. Accordingly, the Court concludes that this FOIA request is of paramount public importance.\n\n\u201c[S]tale information is of little value.\u201d Payne Enters., Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Court, agreeing with this truism, therefore concludes that the expeditious completion of Plaintiff\u2019s request is not only practicable, but necessary. See Bloomberg, L.P. v. FDA, 500 F. Supp. 2d 371, 378 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2007) (\u201c[I]t is the compelling need for such public understanding that drives the urgency of the request.\u201d). To that end, the Court further concludes that the production rate, as detailed below, appropriately balances the need for unprecedented urgency in processing this request with the FDA\u2019s concerns regarding the burdens of production. See Halpern v. FBI, 181 F.3d 279, 284\u201385 (2nd Cir. 1991) (\u201c[FOIA] emphasizes a preference for the fullest possible agency disclosure of such information consistent with a responsible balancing of competing concerns . . . .\u201d).\n\nAccordingly, having considered the Parties\u2019 arguments, filings in support, and the applicable law, the Court ORDERS that:\n\n1. The FDA shall produce the \u201cmore than 12,000 pages\u201d articulated in its own proposal, see ECF No. 29 at 24, on or before January 31, 2022.\n\n2. The FDA shall produce the remaining documents at a rate of 55,000 pages every 30 days, with the first production being due on or before March 1, 2022, until production is complete.\n\n3. To the extent the FDA asserts any privilege, exemption, or exclusion as to any responsive record or portion thereof, FDA shall, concurrent with each production required by this Order, produce a redacted version of the record, redacting only those portions as to which privilege, exemption, or exclusion is asserted.\n\n4. The Parties shall submit a Joint Status Report detailing the progress of the rolling production by April 1, 2022, and every 90 days thereafter.[6]\n\nSO ORDERED on this 6th day of January, 2022.\n\n[1] Surprisingly, the FDA did not send an agency representative to the scheduling conference.\n\n[3] Letter from James Madison to W.T. Barry (August 4, 1822), in 9 WRITINGS OF JAMES MADISON 103 (S. Hunt ed., 1910).\n\n[4] John F.

Comm. on the Judiciary, 108th Cong. 302 (2003).\n\n[6] Although the Court does not decide whether the FDA correctly denied Plaintiff\u2019s request for expedited processing, the issue is not moot. Should the Parties seek to file motions for summary judgment, the Court will take up the issue then.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Judge Rejects FDA\u2019s 75 Year Delay on Vax Data, Cuts to Just 8 Months", "description": "\"This is a great win for transparency...\"", "url": "https://wearechange.org/judge-rejects-fdas-75-year-delay-on-vax-data-cuts-to-just-8-months/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2022-01-07T02:35:39+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IUOIUUUU-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boom!
