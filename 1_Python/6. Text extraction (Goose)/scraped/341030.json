[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report (and as we\u2019ve previously reported on), almost a fortnight ago, President Trump appointed anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to become the Chairman of the Golden Vaccine Safety Task Force, and whose scathing manifesto titled MERCURY & VACCINES shocked the liberal elites in America who have for decades deliberately poisoned millions of children, while at the same time, in 1986, President Clinton [24-1-2017 correction: President Reagan] signed a law called the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 that eliminated any liability to pharmaceutical manufacturers for their complicity in this crime against humanity.\n\nNearly immediately after President Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head this vaccine-autism task force, this report continues, he then requested that Sally Yates become the Acting Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ) on 20 January when he took power\u2014which she accepted, and then nearly immediately afterwards returned to her home city of Atlanta where she empanelled a secret Grand Jury.\n\nTo Acting Attorney General Yates connection to President Trump, this report details, is through her \u201cassociation/employment\u201d with the international legal giant King & Spalding, who in turn created a partnership called Health Care and Life Sciences, in June,2014,with Trump\u2019s mammoth, and feared, global private law firm Jones Day\u2014and coming just 3 months after Trump Tweeted a series of cryptic warnings about vaccines that said:\n\n\u201cIf I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but not allow one time massive shots that a child cannot take-AUTISM.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases!\u201d\n\nAnd three months after the King & Spalding-Jones Day Health Care and Life Sciences partnership was created, this report notes, Trump further Tweeted:\n\n\u201cI am being proven right about massive vaccinations-the doctors lied. Save our children & their future.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump proclaiming that he was \u201cproven right\u201d about vaccines being linked to autism in September, 2014, this report explains, was due to the King & Spalding-Jones Day Health Care and Life Sciences partnership uncovering and protecting the CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson the month prior.\n\nWith Dr. Thompson admitting to Trump\u2019s lawyers that he worked on \u201cfudged numbers\u201d to lower the number of black children who were adversely affected by a certain type of vaccine, his telling how the CDC had committed research fraud with regard to manipulating the pivotal study that showed a correlation between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the onset of autism, and his revealing with secret documents smuggled out of the CDC how they were destroying all evidence proving the vaccine-autism link, this report continues, it was reported in early 2015 that the Obama regime had granted him protection, but that was never proven.\n\nRaising the suspicions that Dr. Thompson was not being protected by the Obama regime, this report explains, was that right before the 2016 US presidential election that brought President Trump to power, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden blocked Dr. Thompson from testifying on scientific fraud and destruction of evidence by senior CDC officials in critical vaccine safety studies regarding the causative relationship between childhood vaccines and autism.\n\nImmediately upon taking power on 20 January, however, this report notes, President Trump fired Dr. Tom Frieden and installed Rear Admiral Dr. Anne Schuchat as the acting head of the CDC\u2014who along with Dr. Thompson were the only two witnesses presented on Saturday (21 January) before the secret Grand Jury called into session by Acting Attorney General Yates.\n\nWith the massive raid conducted by the FBI on the CDC headquarters just hours ago (3:00 am US East Coast time), this report continues, it is apparent that from her secret Grand Jury proceedings, Acting Attorney General Yates was able to secure a warrant for this to happen\u2014though this SVR reports section on this subject is more highly classified than this general report allows mentioning.\n\nThis report concludes by including information from the Ministry of Healthcare (MoH) about this matter that we had previously summarized by stating:\n\nPresident-elect Trump\u2019s views on the linkage of childhood vaccines to autism have long been known, such as when he stated to CNN during a May, 2016 interview:\n\n\u201cAutism has become an epidemic\u2026 Because you take a baby in, and I\u2019ve seen it, and I\u2019ve seen it, and I had my children taken care of, over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump \u2013 I mean, it looks just like it\u2019s meant for a horse, not for a child, and we\u2019ve had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, two-years-old, two-and-a-half-years-old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. \u2026I\u2019m in favor of vaccines [but] do them over a longer period of time, same amount, but just in little sections. I think you\u2019re going to have \u2013 I think you\u2019re going to see a big impact on autism.\u201d\n\nAnd the many (and growing) rumors that President-elect Trump made his decision to run for president due to his youngest child, Barron, having been diagnosed with autism immediately after receiving a childhood vaccine shot in late 2013, and that his wife, Melania, has vowed to file lawsuits against anyone making such a claim\u2014but who, nevertheless, will not be moving to the White House in order to keep her child out of the \u201cmedia bubble\u201d that surrounds all US presidents and their families.\n\nOther reports in this series include:\n\nPope Francis Compares Trump To Hitler As FBI Arrest Of Freemason Spy Shakes Italy To Its Core\n\nPope Francis Orders All Freemasons Expelled After Knights Of Malta Surround President Trump\n\nAmerica On The Brink As President Trump Prepares To Issue CIA Ultimatum\n\nObama Bans Russian News After Putin Warns: \u201cEither Trump Or Bush Will Have To Die\u201d\n\nCIA-Linked Reporter Summoned To Meet Trump Assassinated, And His Top Aide Poisoned Too\n\nTrump Sends Emergency Message To Putin: \u201cI May Not Live Through The Week\u201d\n\nObama Issues Ominous Warning To Trump: \u201cWe Are Not Going Gently Into The Night\u201d\n\n6 Children Dead After Trump Sends Brutal Message To CIA: \u201cYour Families Are Next!\u201d\n\nPutin Orders Combat Alert After SVR Warns Of CIA Plot To Assassinate President-elect Trump\n\nHeads Of US Media \u201cExplode\u201d After Trump Targets Vaccines He Believes Causes Autism\n\nTrump Explodes In \u201cCold Anger\u201d After CIA-NSA Gun Battle In Lower Manhattan\n\nJanuary 23, 2017 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
