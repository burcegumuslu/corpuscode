This was only five weeks after China admitted there was human-to-human transmission of the virus. Zhou is listed as the lead inventor on the patent application lodged by the \u201cInstitute of Military Medicine, Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA\u201d.\n\nNikolai Petrovsky, a medical researcher at Flinders University who has been creating a vaccine for the coronavirus, told the publication that while it was technically possible a vaccine could have been developed in that short amount of time, it would be unlikely and considered a \u201cremarkable achievement.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is something we have never seen achieved before, raising the question of whether this work may have started much \u00adearlier.\u201d\n\nHowever, just several weeks after Zhou filed the patent for the vaccine, he died. The Australian reported that the Five Eyes intelligence alliance \u2014 which is comprised of intelligence agencies from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand \u2014 is now investigating Zhou\u2019s \u201cunexplained death\u201d in May.\n\n\"While he was an award-\u00adwinning military scientist, there were no reports paying tribute to his life,\u201d the report said.\n\n\"His death was only mentioned in passing in a Chinese-media report in July and at the end of a December scientific paper, both had the word \u00ad\u2019deceased\u2019 in brackets after his name.\n\n\"The Weekend Australian has established that his death has been treated as unusual and is an early line of inquiry under the new Five Eyes probe into the origins of Covid-19 launched by Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe report said that Zhou had conducted research experimenting with the spike proteins in coronaviruses and vaccine development.\n\nDavid Asher, who led the Trump administration\u2019s investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, told Fox News during the last week in May that he had U.S. government biostatisticians calculate the probability that the coronavirus developed evolved in nature.\n\nHe said they concluded that it was \u201cabout one in 13 billion.\u201d\n\n[READ MORE] Kamala Harris Named in Hunter Biden Email as Key Contact on China Deal", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/china-admits-destroying-coronavirus-samples-417520.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Top Chinese Military Scientist Died Mysteriously after Filing COVID Vaccine Patent", "description": "Investigation launched after CCP scientist filed COVID-19 vaccine patent in Feb 2020 - An international investigation has been launched after it has now emerged that a leading Chinese ... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["China", "AdFree"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://twitter.com/SharriMarkson/status/1400926746292097026", "https://www.dailywire.com/news/biostatisticians-calculated-odds-of-coronavirus-evolving-naturally-to-be-1-in-13-billion-top-ex-pandemic-investigator-says", "../../news/13552-kamala-harris-named-in-hunter-biden-email-as-key-contact-on-china-deal"], "authors": ["Jay Greenberg"], "publish_date": "2021-06-08"}
