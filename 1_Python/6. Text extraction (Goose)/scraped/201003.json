Kennedy, Jr. or Sherri Tenpenny. This is a large volume of content that is almost always reportable. Ex. RFK posts that 4,000 vaccine adverse reactions were reported to CDC in one week.\u201d\n\nIf all Americans rejected Big Pharma entirely, the powers that be would no longer be\n\nAlleged \u201cmisinformation\u201d is not the Stanford Virality Project\u2019s only concern. It turns out that \u201ctrue content\u201d is also off limits from the social media-sphere because it \u201cmight promote vaccine hesitancy,\u201d which the globalists cannot allow to happen on a large scale.\n\nWere tens of millions of Americans to wake up to the vaccine scam, Big Pharma\u2019s profit streams would halt, crashing Wall Street\u2019s \u201cstock market\u201d casino and putting an end to Mystery Babylon\u2019s cash cow \u2013 the globalists cannot allow any of this to happen, either.\n\nOne way they are muzzling the truth from getting out is by bullying tech platforms like Facebook and Twitter into censoring \u201cviral posts of individuals expressing vaccine hesitancy, or stories of true vaccine side effects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis content is not clearly mis or disinformation, but it may be malinformation (exaggerated or misleading),\u201d the Virality Project\u2019s internal documents read. \u201cAlso included in this bucket are often true posts which could fuel hesitancy, such as individual countries banning certain vaccines.\u201d\n\nTwo examples were included alongside this, one being news articles and posts about a central New York school district having to close after many school staff fell ill with covid \u201cvaccine\u201d side effects.\u201d The other centers around \u201cconversation around recent celebrity deaths after vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cOften this content is unverifiable (cause of death is unclear), but spreads quickly and drives conversations about hesitancy \u2026,\u201d the Virality Project documents further read.\n\nCommenting on these and other Twitter Files revelations, Taibbi wrote in a separate tweet that all of this \u201cis the Censorship-Industrial Complex at its essence: a bureaucracy willing to sacrifice factual truth in service of broader narrative objectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of what a free press does,\u201d he added.\n\nIronically, the Censorship-Industrial Complex is the very thing it claims to be fighting: a prominent source of disinformation. And it has the advantage in that its funding comes from American taxpayers, whom Taibbi says are inadvertently \u201cfunding their own estrangement from reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout real oversight mechanisms, there is nothing to prevent these super-empowered information vanguards from bending the truth for their own ends,\u201d Taibbi further wrote.\n\nThe late President Dwight Eisenhower warned about all this in his farewell address to America, stating that \u201cthe potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists\u201d \u2013 watch the full farewell speech below:\n\nThe only way to put a stop to the madness is to stop funding it. One person, responding to Taibbi\u2019s Twitter Files chain, wrote that the only way to have any \u201creal oversight\u201d over the Censorship-Industrial Complex is to \u201ccut off state tax funding and return full monetary control and power to the people, who then get to decide how much of their money they\u2019d like to contribute to common efforts to spend on what.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote simply that the time is now to \u201cstop this s***\u201d once and for all, through whatever means possible, so that current and future generations of Americans will not have to live under the type of tyranny our ancestors fought to escape.\n\n\u201cSo \u2018misinformation\u2019 is now also lumped in with disagreeing with something and posting a news article that is true, just because it might make someone hesitate to take a new medical thing,\u201d clarified another about Stanford\u2019s apparent position on the First Amendment.\n\nThe latest news about the Twitter Files and what they reveal can be found at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Authoritarian \u201cVirality Project\u201d of Stanford called for Big Tech to censor TRUE stories of vaccine injuries", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicine.news/2023-03-16-vitality-project-stanford-big-tech-censorship-vaccine-injuries.html", "site_name": "Medicine News", "description": "Author and former Rolling Stone contributing editor Matt Taibbi is on a roll in breaking down the contents of the Twitter Files, which show that Stanford University is pushing Big Tech to censor \u201cstories of true vaccine side effects\u201d and \u201ctrue posts which could fuel hesitancy.\u201d In post No. 32 of a lengthy Twitter Files [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.medicine.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/03/Censorship-Typewriter-Censored.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "Liberty", "speech police", "deep state", "deception", "stanford", "Twitter", "Virality Project", "vaccine", "First Amendment", "disinfo", "propaganda", "Big Tech", "misinformation", "free press", "Suppressed", "Social media", "thought police", "Facebook", "Glitch", "Censorship", "Collusion", "injuries", "free speech"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cyZoUfNsUl8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cyZoUfNsUl8"}], "links": ["https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1633955467968802816?s=20", "http://www.stanford.edu", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-12-2025-humanity-bug-eating-transgenders-transhumanist-computer.html", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "http://suppressed.news", "http://deepstate.news", "http://censorship.news", "https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1633955467968802816?s=20", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-12-2025-humanity-bug-eating-transgenders-transhumanist-computer.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fmedicine%2F2023-03-16-vitality-project-stanford-big-tech-censorship-vaccine-injuries.html&linkname=Authoritarian%20%E2%80%9CVirality%20Project%E2%80%9D%20of%20Stanford%20called%20for%20Big%20Tech%20to%20censor%20TRUE%20stories%20of%20vaccine%20injuries", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
