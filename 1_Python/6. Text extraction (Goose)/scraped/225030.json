Nearly a third (31%) of the women had miscarriages or preterm births, which occurred within as little as one day of injection \u2014 the majority after a single dose of vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe descriptions of miscarriages and premature births accompanying the VAERS reports are tragic and hair-raising.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, a 37-year-old who received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine at 28 weeks of pregnancy, just after an ultrasound showed a healthy placenta, was discovered to have \u2018significant placenta issues just one week later.\u2019 A repeat ultrasound showed that the placenta had \u2018calcified and aged prematurely,\u2019 leading to recommended hospitalization for the duration of her pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cA 35-year-old, also vaccinated at around 29 weeks of pregnancy, \u2018noticed decreased motion of the baby\u2019 two days after receiving the Pfizer injection. The following day, \u2018the baby was found to not have a heartbeat\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo Pfizer vaccine recipients in earlier stages of pregnancy (first trimester) had miscarriages after experiencing \u2018intolerable\u2019 abdominal pain and uterine bleeding extensive enough, in one case, to require \u2018emergency surgery and a blood transfusion\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026the World Health Organization on Jan. 27 issued guidance advising against pregnant women getting Moderna\u2019s COVID vaccine \u2014 only to reverse that guidance two days later, as The New York Times reported.\u201d\n\n\u201cDocumented risks of vaccination during pregnancy include miscarriage as well as neurodevelopmental problems arising from maternal immune activation (an inflammatory response in the mother that can harm fetal brain development).\u201d\n\nConcerning that last paragraph: Before the experimental RNA COVID vaccines were authorized, RNA technology had experienced failures and serious problems in clinical trials\u2014because the immune system went into overdrive. It is this immune hyper-response that may be responsible for the recent reported miscarriages and pre-term births; the body basically attacks itself.\n\nThis RNA effect is documented in studies published before 2019. The vaccine makers and public health agencies are well aware of it.\n\nBut this is just the beginning of the story, because what is happening to vaccinated women now may be part of a much larger history, involving extensive research on medically induced birth control\u2014also known as population reduction.\n\nIn the vaccine research community, it\u2019s an open secret that the Rockefeller Fund, the UN, and other groups have been backing the development of vaccines that function as agents of population reduction. This work has been going on for decades.\n\nWhat follows are examples of the evidence. They cite the Third World as the target, but no one should take that as a hideous sign that depopulation efforts are confined to one group of countries. These efforts are universal.\n\nThe late well-known journalist, Alexander Cockburn, on the op ed page of the LA Times, on September 8, 1994, in his piece \u201cReal U.S. Policy in Third World: Sterilization: Disregard the \u2019empowerment\u2019 shoe polish\u2013the goal is to keep the natives from breeding,\u201d [2] reviewed the infamous Kissinger-commissioned 1974 National Security Study Memorandum 200, \u201cwhich addressed population issues\u201d:\n\n\u201c\u2026 the true concern of Kissinger analysts [in Memorandum 200] was maintenance of US access to Third World resources. They worried that the \u2018political consequences\u2019 of population growth [in the Third World] could produce internal instability \u2026 With famine and food riots and the breakdown of social order in such countries, [the Kissinger memo warns that] \u2018the smooth flow of needed materials will be jeopardized.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn other words, too many people equals disruption for the transnational corporations, who steal nations from those very people. Therefore, reduce the population.\n\nTherefore, develop a vaccine that does that job.\n\nJournalist Cockburn, in his LA Times piece, goes on to say that the writers of the Kissinger memo \u201cfavored sterilization over food aid.\u201d He notes that, \u201cBy 1977, Reimart Ravenholt, the director of AID\u2019s [US Agency for International Development] population program, was saying that his agency\u2019s goal was to sterilize one-quarter of the world\u2019s women.\u201d\n\nHere is an astonishing journal paper. November, 1993. FASEB Journal, volume 7, pp.1381-1385. Authors\u2014Stephan Dirnhofer et al. Dirnhofer was a member of the Institute for Biomedical Aging Research of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\n\nA quote from the paper: \u201cOur study provides insights into possible modes of action of the birth control vaccine promoted by the Task Force on Birth Control Vaccines of the WHO (World Health Organization).\u201d\n\nA birth control vaccine? Yes. A vaccine whose purpose is to achieve miscarriages. This particular vaccine was apparently just one of several anti-fertility vaccines the Task Force was promoting.\n\nAnd yes, there is a Task Force on Birth Control Vaccines at the WHO. This journal paper focuses on a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin B (hCG). There is a heading in the FASEB paper (p.1382) called \u201cAbility of antibodies to neutralize the biological activity of hCG.\u201d The authors are trying to discover whether a state of non-fertility can be achieved by blocking the normal activity of hCG.\n\nThis hormone helps sustain pregnancy. If the immune system can be trained to attack it, pregnancy will collapse and a miscarriage will occur.\n\nAnother journal paper: The British Medical Bulletin, volume 49, 1993. \u201cContraceptive Vaccines.\u201d [4] The authors\u2014RJ Aitken et al. From the MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.\n\n\u201cThree major approaches to contraceptive vaccine development are being pursued at the present time. The most advanced approach, which has already reached the stage of phase 2 clinical trials, involves the induction of immunity against human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Vaccines are being engineered \u2026 incorporating tetanus or diptheria toxoid linked to a variety of hCG-based peptides \u2026 Clinical trials have revealed that such preparations are capable of stimulating the production of anti-hCG antibodies\u2026\u201d\n\nThe authors are talking about creating an immune response against this female hormone. Training a woman\u2019s body to react against one of its own secreted hormones. The authors state, \u201cThe fundamental principle behind this approach to contraceptive vaccine development is to prevent the maternal recognition of pregnancy by inducing a state of immunity against hGC, the hormone that signals the presence of the embryo to the maternal endocrine system.\u201d\n\nStop the female body from recognizing a state of pregnancy. Get the body to treat the natural hormone hCG as an intruder, a disease agent, and mobilize the forces of the immune system against it. Create a synthetic effect, an engineered effect, by which the mother\u2019s \u201cmaternal endocrine system\u201d does not swing into gear when pregnancy occurs. The result? The embryo in the mother is swept away by her next period\u2014since hGC, which signals the existence of the pregnancy and halts menstruation cycles, is now treated as a disease entity.\n\nThe authors put it this way: \u201cIn principle, the induction of immunity against hGC should lead to a sequence of normal, or slightly extended, menstrual cycles during which any pregnancies would be terminated\u2026\u201d\n\nMiscarriage would then be the \u201cnormal\u201d state of affairs.\n\n\u201cDuring the next decade the world\u2019s population is set to rise by around 500 million. Moreover, because the rates of population growth in the developing countries of Africa, South America, and Asia will be so much greater than the rest of the world, the distribution of this dramatic population growth will be uneven\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo other vaccine methods are described. They \u201caim to prevent conception by interfering with the intricate cascade of interactive events that characterize the union of male and female gametes at fertilization.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to The Lancet, p.1222, Volume 339, May 16, 1992, \u201cCameroon: Vaccination and politics,\u201d [5] Peter Ndumbe and Emmanuel Yenshu report on their efforts to analyze widespread popular resistance to a tetanus vaccine given in the northwest province of Cameroon.\n\nTwo of the reasons women rejected the vaccine: it was given only to \u201cfemales of childbearing age,\u201d and people heard that a \u201csterilizing agent\u201d was present in the vaccine.\n\nIndeed, these are the charges leveled against past tetanus vaccine campaigns in Kenya and the Philippines. In Kenya (2014), an intense standoff occurred\u2014with the Catholic Doctors Association and Kenyan Catholic Bishops on one side, and the Kenyan government Health Authority on the other.\n\nBoth sides claimed they tested vials of the tetanus vaccine. The Catholic groups\u2019 lab report indicated the vaccine contained hCG; the Health Authority\u2019s report indicated no hCG was present.\n\n\u201cMass Sterilization: Kenyan Doctors Find Anti-Fertility Agent in UN Tetanus Vaccine,\u201d [6] November 8, 2014, by Steve Weatherbe, earth-heal.com: \u201cKenya\u2019s Catholic bishops are charging two United Nations organizations with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus inoculation program sponsored by the Kenyan government.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to a statement released Tuesday by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, the organization has found an antigen that causes miscarriages in a vaccine being administered to 2.3 million girls and women by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Priests throughout Kenya reportedly are advising their congregations to refuse the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen,\u2019 Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews. \u201cThey were all laced with HCG\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released November 4, \u2018This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn the present situation, we have COVID vaccines. They\u2019re being injected all over the world. Women are making reports of bleeding, disrupted menstrual cycles, miscarriages, pre-term births.\n\nThere is a long history, extending to the present day, of elite groups researching and deploying vaccines designed to terminate pregnancies, for the purpose of depopulation.\n\nThe elite groups and players behind the current \u201cpandemic\u201d\u2014the WHO, UN, Bill Gates, Rockefeller Institute, etc.\u2014are the same groups who have been developing depopulation vaccines.\n\nIt lights up like a giant sign, at the beginning of the trail of investigation into the use of COVID vaccines for depopulation.\n\nMore coming in the next article\u2026\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
