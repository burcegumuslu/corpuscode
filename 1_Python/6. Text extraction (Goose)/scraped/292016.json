It studied 301 students from two schools, all between the ages of 13 and 18.\n\nAll of the students were partially vaccinated, having received a dose of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Forty-four of the participants had underlying health conditions, such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, G6PD deficiency and thalassemia trait.\n\nResearchers conducted laboratory tests to establish a baseline, and then followed up with the students at intervals of three, seven and 14 days after they receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe researchers found that 29.24 percent of the study participants \u2013 or 88 of the 301 students \u2013 experienced cardiovascular incidents following vaccination, including heart palpitations, chest pains, shortness of breath, tachycardia and myopericarditis.\n\nFifty-four students had abnormal electrocardiogram results. Six students experienced mitral valve prolapses. Another six had high blood pressure and seven were diagnosed with heart inflammation.\n\nTwo of the children had to be hospitalized, with one of them being admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nThe conclusion of the researchers was particularly mild, considering the study\u2019s findings. They believe that, if adolescents have to be vaccinated, they should at least be monitored for side effects, especially if they receive the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nStudy once again proves vaccines shouldn\u2019t be given to children\n\nMedical professionals who reacted to the Thai study all believe that it provides more evidence proving that children should not be given COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cAny form of heart damage in young persons is concerning since the long-term risks of heart failure and sudden death with exercise are unknown,\u201d noted Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist and the chief medical adviser for the Truth for Health Foundation. \u201cThis is one of [about] 200 published papers demonstrating the risks of COVID-19 vaccination far outweigh any theoretical benefit.\u201d\n\nDr. Anish Koka, another cardiologist, said the results of the new study \u201care not reassuring.\u201d He also criticized the study authors for characterizing some of the heart conditions the children experienced, such as myopericarditis, as \u201cmild.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, Koka noted, the study \u201chelps fill in some of the data void so parents and their doctors can be better informed when discussing the risks and benefits of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nDel Bigtree and Jefferey Jaxen, on an episode of \u201cThe Highwire,\u201d noted that American public health institutions continue to ignore the evidence.\n\n\u201cDoes someone want to actually put a pause button out and say, \u2018Hold on a second, this doesn\u2019t look so good?\u2019 They\u2019re literally ignoring that,\u201d said Bigtree.\n\n\u201cThis is the state of science in the United States, and this is why we may be in some real trouble until this changes,\u201d said Jaxen. \u201d\n\nLearn more about the harmful effects of COVID-19 vaccines on VaccineInjuryNews.com.\n\nWatch this clip from \u201cThe HighWire\u201d as host Del Bigtree and investigative reporter Jefferey Jaxen discuss the latest study proving that the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous for children\u2019s hearts.\n\u2022 Gender Clinics Helping Children Transition as Young as 8 Years Old, Project Veritas Reveals\n\u2022 Polyamorous relationships on the rise in USA, 25% of Americans Believe Such Marriages are Normal\n\u2022 Dalai Lama Caught Kissing Young Boy and Telling Him to 'Suck My Tongue'\n\nDid you like this information?
